For example, mobile phones may execute applications useful in executing workflows associated with business process, such as enterprise resource planning (ERP) processes. The applications may be delivered, for example, via an app store, and downloaded to the mobile device. The mobile device may then execute the downloaded application to provide for desired functionality, e.g., the execution of the workflows. During continued business operations, the workflows and process may change. It would be beneficial to provide for improved systems and methods that incorporate changes to workflows and processes.","Certain embodiments commensurate in scope with the originally claimed invention are summarized below. These embodiments are not intended to limit the scope of the claimed invention, but rather these embodiments are intended only to provide a brief summary of possible forms of the invention. Indeed, the invention may encompass a variety of forms that may be similar to or different from the embodiments set forth below.","In a first embodiment, a non-transitory computer readable medium storing executable instructions is provided. The instructions, when executed by a processor, cause the processor to communicatively couple to a mobile device and to receive a user login, a user password, and a client identification from the mobile device. The instructions additionally cause the processor to validate a client as a licensed client based on the based on the user login, user password, and client identification and to derive a connectivity data based on the user login, user password, and client identification if the client is a valid licensed client, wherein the connectivity data comprises a first connectivity data configured to communicatively couple the mobile device to a first system; and wherein the mobile device is configured to download a first API from the first system.","In a second embodiment, a system is provided. The system includes a processor configured to communicatively couple to a mobile device and to receive a user login, a user password, and a client identification from the mobile device. The processor is additionally configured to validate a client as a licensed client based on the based on the user login, user password, and client identification. The processor is further configured to derive a connectivity data based on the user login, user password, and client identification if the client is a valid licensed client, wherein the connectivity data comprises a first connectivity data configured to communicatively couple the mobile device to a first system; and wherein the mobile device is configured to download a first API from the first system.","In a third embodiment, a method is provided. The method includes communicatively coupling a license server to a mobile device. The method additionally includes receiving, from the mobile device, a user login, a user password, and a client identification. The method further includes validating, via the license server, a client as a licensed client based on the based on the user login, user password, and client identification. The method also includes deriving, via the license server, a connectivity data based on the user login, user password, and client identification if the client is a valid licensed client, wherein the connectivity data comprises a first connectivity data configured to communicatively couple the mobile device to a first system; and wherein the mobile device is configured to download a first API from the first system.","One or more specific embodiments will be described below. In an effort to provide a concise description of these embodiments, not all features of an actual implementation are described in the specification. It should be appreciated that in the development of any such actual implementation, as in any engineering or design project, numerous implementation-specific decisions must be made to achieve the developers' specific goals, such as compliance with system-related and business-related constraints, which may vary from one implementation to another. Moreover, it should be appreciated that such a development effort might be complex and time consuming, but would nevertheless be a routine undertaking of design, fabrication, and manufacture for those of ordinary skill having the benefit of this disclosure.","When introducing elements of various embodiments of the present invention, the articles \u201ca,\u201d \u201can,\u201d \u201cthe,\u201d and \u201csaid\u201d are intended to mean that there are one or more of the elements. The terms \u201ccomprising,\u201d \u201cincluding,\u201d and \u201chaving\u201d are intended to be inclusive and mean that there may be additional elements other than the listed elements.","Embodiments of the present disclosure may apply to a variety of mobile devices, cell phones, tablets, smart eyeglasses, watches, and the like. Certain embodiments may also apply to desktop computers, workstations, notebooks, laptops, and so on. The techniques described herein provide for improved systems and methods suitable for dynamically reconfiguring or otherwise reprogramming the graphical user interface (GUI) and the business processes, including workflows, of the aforementioned devices. In one embodiment, an application (app) store may host a mobile (or desktop) device application that includes certain reprogramming techniques. The application may be downloaded and executed by the mobile (or desktop) device, and communicatively connected to a license server. The license server may validate the user and\/or mobile device and may then provide for communication information which may then enable the mobile device to communicatively couple with an external system, such as an enterprise resource planning system (ERP), a financial system, a supply chain management (SCM) system, a manufacturing system, or a combination thereof.","When the mobile is coupled to the external system, the mobile device may retrieve an application programming interface (API) suitable for reprogramming the look and feel of the mobile application's GUI, as well as reprogramming the processes included in the mobile application, including workflows. In certain embodiments, the entire API or portions of the API may be retrieved on every transaction between the mobile application and the external system, such as transactions that read data, transactions that write data (e.g., inserts of the data, updates of the data, and deletes of the data), or a combination thereof. In other embodiments, only certain transactions or transaction types may trigger the retrieval of the API or portions of the API, such as read transactions, insert transactions, update transactions, delete transactions, or a combination thereof. In yet another embodiment, certain time periods (e.g., 1 minute, 1 hour, 1 day, 1 week) may be used to trigger the download of the API or portions of the API into the application.","Additionally, a customization system may be provided, suitable for reconfiguring the API based on changes to certain processes. The customization system may enable an organization to customize the GUI presented by the application as well as the business processes executable by the application, and the customization may then be saved onto the API for transmission to the application. In certain embodiments, only the delta differences, e.g., the differences between the previous API and the changes to the latest API are transmitted to the application, thus minimizing communications and memory overhead. In other embodiments, all of the API may always be transmitted.","Turning now to , the figure is a block diagram of an embodiment of a mobile device , which may be communicatively coupled to a License Server , and an enterprise resource planning (ERP) system , a financial or accounting system , other external systems , and\/or a middleware server . The mobile device  may include, for example, a cell phone, a tablet, smart eyewear, a smart wristwatch, or a combination thereof. In other embodiments, other computing devices, such as a computer, a work station, a notebook, a laptop, and so on, may be used additionally or alternatively to the mobile device . In the depicted embodiment, an application (app) store  is depicted. The app store  may include a variety of processor-executable programs or applications suitable for execution by the mobile device  or other computing device. As depicted, the app store  may be communicatively coupled to the mobile device  through a cloud system . The cloud  may include the internet, a local area network (LAN), a wide area network (WAN), or a combination thereof, suitable for establishing communication between the mobile device  and the app store . In use, the mobile device  may communicate with the app store  to download a dynamic application . The dynamic application  may include, executable code suitable for execution by via a processor  included in the mobile device , and may be stored in a non-transitory computer readable medium (e.g., flash memory, solid-state drive, hard drive) such as a memory  also included in the mobile device .","The dynamic application  may include certain processes useful in interfacing with the systems , , and\/or . For example, unlike a web browser, the application  may include compiled client processes or programs suitable for communicatively coupling the mobile device  to the systems , ,  and executing a variety of processes, such as human capital management (HCM) processes, supplier relationship management (SRM) processes, supply chain management (SCM) processes, financial and accounting processes, and a variety of services automation processes (e.g., project portfolio management, project analytics, program management, resource management, proposal management, project costing, project discovery, billing, contracts, expenses, grants). Also unlike a web browser, the application  may communicate directly with the systems , ,  and\/or  without going through a web browser, thus improving security and minimizing communications overhead. Indeed, the application  may include client-side support for executing, via the mobile device  and\/or the systems , , and\/or , a variety of processes useful in data processing. Each of the systems , , ,  and  may include a respective data repository , , ,  and , suitable for storing and retrieving data, such as a relational database, a network database, a cloud storage, a file system, or a combination thereof. The data repositories , , , , and\/or  may also include security techniques, such as encrypted storage, suitable for protection of the data stored therein.","In use, the application  may display a graphical user interface (GUI) as described in more detail below representative of the processes, including workflows (processes abstracting a variety of sequential and\/or non-sequential steps representative of \u2018real\u2019 work in an organization, such as purchasing steps, human resource steps, supply chain management steps, accounting steps, manufacturing steps, and so on) suitable for performing work supported by the systems , , and\/or . For example, HCM processes may enable for improved human resources functionalities that increase productivity and accelerate business performance and lower costs of ownership. SRM processes may enable improved supply chain management and decreased supply management costs. SCM processes may provide for increased flexibility and synchronization of the supply chain, thus improving efficiencies and minimizing cost savings over the supply chain or portions of the chain. Services automation processes may provide for operational processes that support project life cycle management across operations, from initial financing to project selection, planning, staffing, through execution, cost control, and performance analysis. Accordingly, a user may perform any number of processes supported by the systems , , and\/or  in devices distant from the location of the aforementioned systems. By providing for remote operations via the mobile device , the processes supported by the systems , , and\/or , may be provided at any number of geographic locations more efficiently and in a more cost-effective manner.","In one embodiment, the application  may include executable code, such as compiled code (e.g. compiled C\/C++, Java, C#, Objective C). For example, the application  may include code compiled to target a certain operating system such as an Android\u00ae operating system available from Google, Inc. of Mountain View, Calif., an iOS\u00ae operating system available from Apple Inc. of Cupertino, Calif., Windows\u00ae or Windows\u00ae derivative OS (e.g., Windows\u00ae Phone), and\/or any other mobile device operating system. However, customizations to provide variations in processes between entities (e.g., company A, company B, company C) would have resulted in each company recompiling the code and submitting the updated compilation to the app store  as a different application . For example, company A may desire to provide customizations related to how processes supported by the systems , , and\/or  are typically performed at company A, which may be different from processes provided by the systems , , and\/or  but customized for company B and company C. Rather than provide for a plurality of different applications , each application  supporting a different company A, company B, company C, and so on, the techniques described herein allow for customization of the application  without resorting to recompilation of the application  and further uploading\/downloading from the app store . Likewise, at least because of the compiled nature of the code, changes in the processes supported by the code would have resulted in a recompilation of the code, transmittal of the new version of the code to the app store , and subsequent downloads to the mobile device .","Instead of recompiling, each one of the systems , , and\/or , may be provided with a customization system  suitable for customizing various aspects of the application . For example, the customization system  may enable the creation of an API Data  that includes a GUI sub-API  and\/or a process sub-API  suitable for dynamically changing both the GUI of the application  as well as the behavior of the application  without further compilation of the dynamic application . Indeed, the API Data  may be transmitted to the mobile device  and used by the dynamic application  to reconfigure the look-and-feel of the application  as well as the behavior of the application  when interacting with the systems , , and\/or . In this manner, a client, such as the company A, may provide for a custom API Data  different from an API Data  provided by a company B, and thus enable a customization for the company A of the GUI displayed by the dynamic application  as well as customization of the processes supported by the application . By providing for a customizable API data , the techniques described herein may more efficiently customize the GUI and\/or functionality of the dynamic application . Further, licensing and customization systems are provided, useful in managing data for a variety of entities (e.g., companies A, B, C) as described in more detail below.","As depicted, the mobile device  may first communicate with the license server  by using a licensing login . The licensing login  may include, for example user login information  (e.g., username, password), as well as client login information  (e.g., company name) related to the various entities supported by the systems , , and\/or , such as company A, company B, and so on. Once the licensing login  is received by the license server , the license server  may, for example, retrieve information from the data repository  and use the information to verify that the user interacting with the mobile device  has submitted appropriate licensing login information  suitable for providing further services. When the user interacting with the mobile device  has been verified through the submitted licensing login , the license server  may then transmit a licensing data  back to the mobile device . The licensing data  may include, for example, information suitable for further processing by the application , such as a connectivity data .","The connectivity data  may include information useful in communicatively coupling the mobile device  to any one or more of the systems , , . That is, the connectivity data  may include data useful in connecting the mobile devices to multiple systems, including the systems , , , and . For example, the connectivity data  may include Peoplesoft\u00ae connectivity information (e.g., one or more Peoplesoft\u00ae urls), Oracle\u00ae connection strings, MS Sharepoint\u00ae connection strings, MS SQLServer\u00ae connection strings, Open Database Connectivity (ODBC) connection strings, Java\u00ae Database Connectivity (JDBC) connection strings, service oriented architecture (SOA) services connectors, or a combination thereof.","Accordingly, the license server  may both verify the mobile device  as licensed to participate in certain processes, well as provide for the connectivity data  useful in connecting with any number of systems, including the systems , , , and\/or . Once connected, each of the systems , , , and\/or  may then transmit the API Data  to the mobile device . The dynamic application  may then reconfigure itself in situ and without further recompilation by using the API Data  to redraw the GUI and\/or to reprogram the processes used in interacting with the systems , , , and\/or .","The middleware server  may be included in any one of the systems , , , and\/or , or may be used as a standalone server . For example, the middleware server  may be incorporated as a subsystem of the ERP system , and the server  may contain the functionality of the customization system  useful in modifying the API data , alternatively to the customization system  being included in the ERP system . Likewise, the middleware server  may be included in the systems , , and , or a combination thereof. Providing the middleware server  enables more efficient utilization of certain distributed server techniques, such as message oriented middleware (MOM) techniques, object request broker (ORB) techniques, and\/or enterprise service bus (ESB) techniques useful in providing for enterprise services and\/or an abstraction layer (e.g., customizable API abstraction layer) for any of the systems , , , and\/or . It is to be understood that each of the server , and each of the systems , , , and  may each include a processor configured to execute any of the processes described herein, as well as a memory configured to store computer instructions (e.g., the executable processes).","Turning now to , the figure is a flowchart of an embodiment of a process  suitable for reconfiguring or otherwise reprogramming the dynamic application  of the mobile device  shown in  above in situ and without recompiling the application . The process  may be stored as computer instructions or executable code in the memory  of the mobile device  and executed by the processor .","In the depicted embodiment, the process  may download the application , for example, by utilizing the app store  (block ). The process  may then provide the licensing login  and log in to the license server  to download the license data  (block ). Accordingly, the license server  may validate the licensing login  by retrieving certain login and licensing data from the data repository , and then the licensing server  may provide the license data  to the mobile device . As mentioned above, the license data  may include connectivity data . Accordingly, the mobile device  may use the connectivity data  to communicatively couple to any one of the systems , , , and\/or . For example, the mobile device  may connect (block ) to a first system (e.g., ERP system ), connect (block ) to a second system (e.g., financials system ), and additionally connect (block ) to an Nth system (e.g., other system ).","As mentioned above, the application  may then issue a system request , for example, a request  to read or write data or to perform a process action from any one of the systems , , , and\/or . Upon receipt of the system request , any one of the connected systems , , , and\/or  may then submit their respective API data  (block ). That is, each one of the connected systems , , N, may have a customized API data  and therefore the application  may then receive one or more of the API data . Upon receipt of the API data , the application  may then reconfigure a respective GUI (block ) for each one of the connected systems that may have provided the API data . Additionally or alternatively, each of the API data  may be used to reconfigure one or more processes (block ) associated with the system that submitted the respective API data . By using the API data  to reconfigure the GUI and\/or processes for connected systems, a highly customizable application  may be derived, suitable for supporting a number of clients (e.g., company A, B, C). The process  may then iterate and issue another system request . Indeed, in the depicted embodiment, every system request  (read or write of data, or process action) may result in the downloading (block ) of the API data , and subsequent reconfiguration of the GUI (block ) and desired processes (block ). In this manner, the application  may always reflect the latest customization provided via the API data .",{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0037","num":"0036"},"figref":"FIG. 3","b":["70","40","70","12","12","70","72","40","10","70","74","40","70","13","12","13"]},"If the process  determines (decision ) that the licensing request is not valid, the process  may inform the user for retransmission of the licensing login . If multiple attempts include incorrect licensing login , the process  may prevent any further login attempts and place the mobile device  in a holding queue for a desired period of time (e.g., 10 minutes, 1 hour, 2 hours, 1 day). When placed in the holding queue, any login requests from the mobile device  may be ignored. In other embodiments, no holding queue may be used and the any number of login attempts may be processed. If the process  determines (decision ) that the licensing request (e.g., licensing login ) is valid, the process  may then retrieve (block ) licensing data for a first system (e.g., system ), retrieve (block ) licensing data for a second system (e.g., system ), and retrieve (block ) licensing data for an Nth system (e.g., system ). Indeed, because each client (e.g., company A) may use multiple systems, the licensing server  may store multiple connectivity data , at least one for each of the systems , , , and\/or  that the client may have installed. Accordingly, each of the connectivity data  (one or more for each system , , , and\/or ) may be combined (block ) into a single licensing data message  and transmitted back to the mobile device . By validating the licensing login , retrieving and combining client-specific connectivity data , and transmitting the licensing data  back to the mobile device , the license server  may provide for an improved login process suitable for connecting the mobile device  to a variety of systems (e.g., systems , , , and\/or ).",{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0039","num":"0038"},"figref":"FIG. 4","b":["90","34","90","32","32","90","92","94","94","96","90","98","100"]},"If customization of the process underlying the customized GUI is desired, a list of process templates may then be provided (block ). The list may include processes that the GUI undergoing customization may interact with. Accordingly, these processes may also be selected (block ) for customization. Templates may include workflows and\/or processes related to HCM processes, SRM processes, SCM processes, financial and accounting processes, and a variety of services automation processes (e.g., project portfolio management, project analytics, program management, resource management, proposal management, project costing, project discovery, billing, contracts, expenses, grants). In one embodiment, the templates (and initial uncustomized GUI) may be provided by a manufacturer of the systems , , and\/or , such as Oracle\u00ae, Microsoft\u00ae, SAP\u00ae, by the provider of the license server , or a combination thereof.","During customization, steps in the template may be reordered (block ), for example, step  may be moved in front of step , or a step that was sequential may be converted into asynchronous, or vice versa. Likewise, the functionality of the step may be modified (block ). For example, the step may execute a SQL query (insert, update, or delete query) and the SQL query may be modified to provide for a more customized result or action. The process  may then combine (block ) the GUI customization and process customization into the API data . As mentioned above, in one embodiment, the API data  may be transmitted to the mobile device , for example, every time that the mobile device  interacts with the systems , , , and\/or . Accordingly, changes to the API data , for example, by using the process , may be more easily and efficiently distributed.","The API  may be provided in various formats, including tokenized strings, binary formats, XML, text-based formats, and the like. One non-limiting API  example using XML as a format is as follows:","A Request for an API  may take the following form:",{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0043","num":"0042"},"tables":{"@attributes":{"id":"TABLE-US-00001","num":"00001"},"table":{"@attributes":{"frame":"none","colsep":"0","rowsep":"0"},"tgroup":{"@attributes":{"align":"left","colsep":"0","rowsep":"0","cols":"1"},"colspec":{"@attributes":{"colname":"1","colwidth":"217pt","align":"left"}},"thead":{"row":{"entry":{"@attributes":{"namest":"1","nameend":"1","align":"center","rowsep":"1"}}}},"tbody":{"@attributes":{"valign":"top"},"row":[{"entry":"<apps>"},{"entry":"\u2003<authtoken>161d23s5df45w6e546s5d4f65e1sd654fe5<\/authtoken>"},{"entry":"<\/apps>"},{"entry":"Where the authtoken is a process (e.g., process template) identifier "},{"entry":"that may include subidentifiers.
