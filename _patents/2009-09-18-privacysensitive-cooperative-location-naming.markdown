title: Privacy-sensitive cooperative location naming
abstract: A location database may be configured to store a set of subjective, arbitrary, and/or ephemeral names assigned to a location by various users. When a user of a device arrives at a particular location, the device may retrieve and present to the user the set of names assigned to the location. Moreover, the names may be associated with a privacy designation, which may permit an author of a location name to indicate whether the name of a location should be shared with the public or restricted to access by the user (or to a specified group of users, etc.) Other access criteria may also be specified, e.g., read-only access to a name for the public and read/write access to a particular group of users. Within the set of names of a location, particular names may be designated as authoritative, and may be presented to users with emphasis.

{"@attributes":{"id":"description"},"BRFSUM":[{},{}],"heading":["BACKGROUND","SUMMARY","DETAILED DESCRIPTION"],"p":["In several computing scenarios, users may wish to assign names to various locations, where the selection of such names may be subjective, arbitrary, and\/or ephemeral. For example, a user of a geolocation device, such as a global positioning system (GPS) receiver or a triangulation device based on cellular network towers or WiFi routers, may wish to identify locations of interest to the user, such as the home and workplace of the user and the residence of an associate, and to have such identifiers displayed on maps presented to the user. The user may also wish to share these names with other users, e.g., by transmitting a set of named locations to another device operated by a second user. The name assigned to the location by the first user may therefore be displayed for the second user, e.g., by a position-aware device that senses that the second user is in the proximity of the named location.","This Summary is provided to introduce a selection of concepts in a simplified form that are further described below in the Detailed Description. This Summary is not intended to identify key factors or essential features of the claimed subject matter, nor is it intended to be used to limit the scope of the claimed subject matter.","Where users wish to share the names assigned to various locations, a centralized location database may therefore be configured to store the names of locations assigned by various users, and may be accessed by the devices of various users to retrieve the names of various users attributed to a particular location. However, a particular user may not wish to share all names assigned to various locations with all users of the location database, particularly if the location database is publicly accessible. For example, a user may name a first location as \u201cmy favorite restaurant,\u201d a second location as \u201cmy house,\u201d and a third location as \u201cmy physician's office.\u201d If the user transmits these names to a location database, the user may be amenable to sharing the name of the first location with the entire public, but may wish to share the name of the second location only with a small group of users (e.g., friends of the user), and may wish to restrict the name of the third location to access by himself or herself.","In order to accommodate the privacy interests of the user in sharing location names, a location database may be configured to store with each name of a location a privacy designation, such as a public designation indicating permission by the user to transmit the location to any other users or a private designation indicating a preference to restrict access to the name of the location to the user. Other privacy designations may also be available, e.g., a group designation indicating that the user wishes to grant permission to access the name of the location only to a particular set of users. When the user is subsequently near a particular location, the location database may then be queried for all names of the location having either a public designation, and for all names having a private designation and that were created by the user; all such names may then be presented to describe the current location of the user. In this manner, a shared location database may be generated that is configured to recognize and support the privacy interests of the users in assigning names to various locations.","Additional variations may also be devised that may present additional advantages. Additional access designations may be supported; e.g., the names of a particular area (such as a building) may be designated or edited only by a particular user having permission to name the location represented by the area, but the public may be able to access the names of the location on a read-only basis. Additionally, among the set of names assigned to a location by various users, a particular subset of names may be designated as authoritative; e.g., members of the public may be permitted to assign names to a location, but a set of authoritative names may also be retrieved from an authoritative location name source, such as a trusted location name directory, and may be presented with emphasis among all of the names of the location.","To the accomplishment of the foregoing and related ends, the following description and annexed drawings set forth certain illustrative aspects and implementations. These are indicative of but a few of the various ways in which one or more aspects may be employed. Other aspects, advantages, and novel features of the disclosure will become apparent from the following detailed description when considered in conjunction with the annexed drawings.","The claimed subject matter is now described with reference to the drawings, wherein like reference numerals are used to refer to like elements throughout. In the following description, for purposes of explanation, numerous specific details are set forth in order to provide a thorough understanding of the claimed subject matter. It may be evident, however, that the claimed subject matter may be practiced without these specific details. In other instances, structures and devices are shown in block diagram form in order to facilitate describing the claimed subject matter.","Within the field of computing, many scenarios may involve a naming of locations by one or more users. As a first example, a mapping application may present a visual depiction of an area, and users may choose locations of interest and may assign names to the various locations. As a second example, a global positioning system(GPS) receiver may detect the location of a user, may permit the user to assign a name to the current location; when the user subsequently approaches the location, the device may identify the previously specified names of the location, and may present the names to the user. The capability of naming locations may permit various advantages, e.g., by permitting a user to request routing to a destination according to a name familiar to or preferred by the user. Such names may also be assigned subjectively (e.g., a designation only relevant to a particular user or set of users, such as \u201chome\u201d), arbitrary (e.g., according to a semantic that is difficult to determine from the location, such as the starting point of a foot race), and\/or ephemerally (e.g., a streetside location where a user may have temporarily parked a vehicle, or names associated with a particular event, such as mile markers along a race course.)","Moreover, a user may wish to share the designated names of one or more locations with other users. For example, a user may assign a set of names to various locations (e.g., \u201cbest Italian restaurant in town\u201d and \u201cscenic view in the park\u201d), and may wish to share such names of the locations with the public. A location database may therefore be devised and configured to store the names attributed to various locations by various users. When a user is near a location, the location database may be queried for the names of the location specified by the user and other users, and may present all such names to the user in order to describe the location. In this manner, a set of users, perhaps as broad as the general public, may cooperatively describe the locations of an area in a \u201ccrowdsourced\u201d manner.",{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0020","num":"0019"},"figref":"FIG. 1","b":["10","12","14","18","20","20","18","20","18","20","18","18","20","14","18","12","12","18","20","12","18","12","18","12","18","12","18","16","12","18","20"]},"However, in some scenarios, a user  may not wish to share all names  assigned to all locations  with the general public.  presents another exemplary scenario , wherein a first user  of a device  has assigned the names  to various locations  in a similar manner as the exemplary scenario  of , such as a first location  having a name  \u201cmy favorite restaurant,\u201d a second location  having a name  \u201cmy house,\u201d and a third location  having a name  \u201cmy physician's office.\u201d The names  of various locations  are again stored in a location database , which may provide the names  to other users , such as by sharing the names  assigned by the first user  with a second user  of a second device . However, the first user  may wish to control which names  are shared in this manner. For example, the first user  may be willing to share the name  of the first location  with any other user, including the second user . However, the first user  may wish to share the name  of the second location  (\u201cmy house\u201d) only with a select set of users, such as the user's friends and family members, in order to preserve the privacy of the residence of the user  from unknown individuals. Regarding the third location  to which the first user  has assigned the name  \u201cmy physician's office,\u201d the first user  may be uncomfortable sharing this name  even with friends and family, and may wish to restrict the location database  to present the name  of this location  only with the first user .","If the location database  is configured simply to share names  of locations  with the public, the privacy preferences of various users  may be disregarded. As another technique, the user  may choose to deliver to the location database  only the names  that may be publicly accessible, and may choose to restrict to the device  the names  that are not to be shared with the public, thereby applying the privacy preferences of the user  on the device level. However, this scenario may introduce undesirable complexities, such as multiple sources of names  of locations  and a potential inability to present a private name  to the user  on a first device  that is restricted to a second device  owned by the same user .","An alternative technique may be devised to facilitate the association of names with locations while respecting the privacy preferences of the users of such locations names, while also avoiding the complexities of handling privacy preferences at the device level. A location database  may be configured to store, for a particular location , one or more names  with a privacy designation, which may indicate a privacy preference of the author regarding the sharing of the name with other users. For example, the privacy preference may be selected from a set of privacy designations including a public designation that permits public access to the name and a private designation that indicates restricted access based on various criteria (e.g., access only by the user, or only by a group of users specified by the user.) Accordingly, the device  operated by the user  may be configured to store and access names  of locations  in view of the privacy designations specified by the user  and stored in the location database . For example, when the user  specifies a name  of a location , the device  may also receive from the user  a privacy designation indicating the privacy preferences of the user  with regard to the name , and may accordingly store the name  in the location database  with this privacy designation. When the user  later approaches a location , the device  may access the location database  to select any names  of the location  that the user  is permitted to access, including names  of the location  having a public designation and names  having a private designation that permits access by the user  (i.e., a private designation that specifies criteria for access, such as a particular username or user ID, where such criteria are satisfied by the user .) The device  may then present to the user  the names  selected from the location database  as a description of the location . In this manner, the location database  and the device  may together facilitate the naming of a set of locations  by a set of users , while also respecting the privacy preferences of the users  as to who may access a particular name  of a location .",{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0024","num":"0023"},"figref":"FIG. 3","b":["50","50","50","52","54","12","18","20","46","16","20","18","36","48","20","12","50","16","18","20","12","18","12","52","12","18","20","16","18","20","18","12","20","18","40","16","54"]},{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0025","num":"0024"},"figref":"FIG. 4","b":["50","60","52","12","52","54","52","56","12","52","58","12","52","16","18","20","12","18","12","18"]},"Within such a device  as presented in the exemplary scenario  , an exemplary system  may be implemented that facilitates the interfacing of the user  with the location database  while attempting to assign and access the names  of various locations . The exemplary system  comprises a name setting component , which may be configured to, upon receiving from the user  a name  of a location , store in the location database  the location , the name , and a privacy designation . The privacy designation  may, e.g., be selected from a set of privacy designations comprising a public designation and a private designation (possibly among other designations, such as a group designation.) The name setting component  thereby facilitates the setting of names  of locations  and the assignment of privacy restrictions thereto. The name  may be received from the input component  in many ways, such as text input from a hardware or software keyboard, handwriting interpreted by a handwriting recognition component, or spoken input interpreted by a speech recognition component. The exemplary system  also features a name presenting component , which may be configured to present to the user  the names  of a current location  of the user . More specifically, the name presenting component  may be configured to, receiving from the location detection component  a current location  of the user , select from the location database  at least one name  of the current location , where the name  is associated either with a public designation, or with a private designation that permits access by the user  (i.e., a set of access criteria that the user  happens to satisfy.) The name presenting component  is also configured to present to the user  at least one name  of the current location  selected from the location database . For example, the name presenting component  may deliver the names  selected from the location database  to the output component , which may present the names  to the user  in various ways (e.g., as labels of locations  on a map, as a text list of names  of the current location  and\/or nearby locations, or as one or more spoken names.) The exemplary system  thereby facilitates the user  in assigning and accessing the names  of various places  in view of the privacy preferences of the authors of such names .","Still another embodiment involves a computer-readable medium comprising processor-executable instructions configured to apply the techniques presented herein. An exemplary computer-readable medium that may be devised in these ways is illustrated in , wherein the implementation  comprises a computer-readable medium  (e.g., a CD-R, DVD-R, or a platter of a hard disk drive), on which is encoded computer-readable data . This computer-readable data  in turn comprises a set of computer instructions  configured to operate according to the principles set forth herein. In one such embodiment, the processor-executable instructions  may be configured to perform a method of facilitating users in associating names with locations, such as the exemplary method  of . In another such embodiment, the processor-executable instructions  may be configured to implement a system for facilitating users in associating names with locations, such as the exemplary system  of . Many such computer-readable media may be devised by those of ordinary skill in the art that are configured to operate in accordance with the techniques presented herein.","The techniques discussed herein may be devised with variations in many aspects, and some variations may present additional advantages and\/or reduce disadvantages with respect to other variations of these and other techniques. Moreover, some variations may be implemented in combination, and some combinations may feature additional advantages and\/or reduced disadvantages through synergistic cooperation. The variations may be incorporated in various embodiments (e.g., the exemplary method  of  and the exemplary system  of ) to confer individual and\/or synergistic advantages upon such embodiments.","A first aspect that may vary among embodiments of these techniques relates to the scenarios in which such techniques may be utilized. As a first example, many computing scenarios may advantageously incorporate the techniques discussed herein, such as a mapping application configured to identify locations  of interest to various users  according to the names  assigned thereto, or a global positioning system (GPS) receiver configured to display maps of the current location of a user , which may be capable of directing the user  to various locations  according to the names specified by the user  and other users . As a second example, the techniques may be utilized in conjunction with other system and services; e.g., a representation of a set of users  and the relationships may be stored by a social networking service, and the association of names  with locations  may be layered on top of the social networking service. As one such example, a social networking service may allow each user  to designate names  of locations . The privacy policies of the social networking service may extend to the storing and retrieving of names  of locations ; e.g., a user  who defines a location  the name  \u201cJoe's Office\u201d may indicate that only friends of the user  (as represented by the social networking service) may access this name .","As a third example of this first aspect, these applications may be accessible to various sets of users , devices , and\/or locations . In a first set of embodiments, the users  may comprise a closed user set defined in a directory, or an open user set open to the general public that promotes the description of locations in an area through a \u201ccrowdsourcing\u201d mechanism implemented according to the techniques discussed herein. For example, the names  of the locations  may be related to a particular event, such as markers along a race course, and the users may comprise attendees of the event. In a second set of embodiments, the devices  may comprise, e.g., cellular phones, global positioning system (GPS) receivers, small-form-factor computers, tablets, and\/or subnotebooks. In a third set of embodiments, the locations  to which these techniques are applied may comprise actual geographic locations, virtual locations in a simulated environment, locations in space, or locations in a closed system, such as a machine or an organism. Those of ordinary skill in the art may devise many scenarios within which the techniques discussed herein may be utilized.","A second aspect that may vary among embodiments of these techniques relates to the manner of storing in the location database  an association of a name  with a location , as may be specified by a user . As a first example, the name  may be specified by the user , such as through input received via an input component  such as a hardware keyboard, touchscreen coupled with a software keyboard or handwriting recognition component, or microphone coupled with a voice recognition component. Alternatively or additionally, the device  may generate one or more names  of a location  and may suggest such names  to the user , who may accept one or more as the designated names of the location . For example, the device  may present a list of common names , such as \u201chome,\u201d \u201coffice,\u201d \u201cschool,\u201d and \u201cgrocery store,\u201d and a user  may select a particular name  as the designated name of a location  according to the subjective judgment of the user . The device  might also suggest an appending of the name of the user  to the name  of a location , e.g., \u201cJoe's Home\u201d for a location  designated as home by a user  named Joe.","As a second example, the names  specified for a location  by various users  may be sorted, grouped, or ranked in various ways. This may be helpful, e.g., for presenting several names  of a location  to a user  in a manner with a more highly suggested name  promoted over a less suggested name , which may help to identify for the user  more significant information about the location . In one such set of embodiments, among the names  of a location , zero or more names  may be selected as an authoritative name, such as a name  that is trusted to be reliable, descriptive, accurate, or otherwise preferred with respect to the location . In one such embodiment, the device  and\/or the location database  may have access to an authoritative location name source, which may identify, among the names  of a location , one or more names derived from or matching the corresponding entries in the authoritative location name source. The users  may then be permitted to access such authoritative names, e.g., on a read-only basis. In another such embodiment, users  may vote on various names , or user selection of various names  may be tracked, in order to identify one or more often preferred names  as compared to other names  of a location . These names  may then be identified as the authoritative names of the location , which may facilitate the presentation of names to the user  in a more meaningful manner. For example, while presenting the names  of the locations  to the user , the device  may present with emphasis the names  designated as authoritative names of the location .",{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0033","num":"0032"},"figref":"FIG. 6","b":["80","18","20","16","18","20","14","12","16","82","16","18","20","18","20","82","84","20","20","20","82","18","12","14","84","84","18","20"]},"As a third example, the privacy designation  specified for the name  of a location  may be provided and stored in many ways. As a first example, the user  may specify a privacy designation  along with each specified name  of a location  submitted for storage in the location database . Alternatively or additionally, the device  may suggest a privacy designation  according to the name  (e.g., names involving the term \u201chome\u201d may be suggested or automatically designated as private; names involving the term \u201coffice\u201d or \u201cwork\u201d may be suggested or automatically designated as accessible only to a group, such as friends of the user ; and names involving the term \u201crestaurant\u201d may be suggested or automatically designated as public.)","As a fourth example, the location database  may be configured to represent locations  in many ways. In one such embodiment, the location database  may represent respective geographic locations by a single latitude, longitude, altitude coordinate. In another such embodiment, locations  may also be represented of various sizes, such as a radius surrounding a coordinate. In another such embodiment, the location  may be more precisely defined by a set of coordinates that comprise an area (including a three-dimensional volume.) Alternatively or additionally, the location  may be represented as changing over time, or may only be applicable for a particular period of time. The user  may therefore associate a name  with an area associated with a location . As a first such example, the location database  may be configured to associate with respective locations  an area designation, such as a set of coordinates, that may represent an area associated with location  and\/or with a particular name . As a second such example, the user  may define an area designation (e.g., a set of coordinates) of a location , which may be stored by the location database . Moreover, in a further such embodiment, various locations  may be represented as restricted to particular users ; e.g., an area representing property owned by a particular user  may be restricted to naming only by that user . In one such embodiment, storing a name  of a location  in the location database  may involve identifying the user  and querying whether the user  is permitted to name the area, and therefore storing the name  of the location  only after verifying such permission.",{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0036","num":"0035"},"figref":"FIG. 7","b":["90","18","20","94","92","1","2","3","94","20","94","18","1","18","2","18","3","18","94","20","16","18","20","18","94","18","20","12"]},"A third aspect that may vary among embodiments of these techniques relates to the manner of locating the user  at a current location , prior to selecting names  of the current location  and presenting the names  to the user . As a first example, many techniques may be utilized to identify the location of the user , such as various components that may suitably serve as the location identifying component  in the exemplary device  of . One such embodiment involves a geolocation component, such as a global positioning system (GPS) receiver that is configured to coordinate with satellites in order to triangulate the current location  of the user . Another such embodiment may involve a reference point identifying component, which may identify nearby reference points of known locations, such as cellular network towers or wireless network routers, and may triangulate or identify the current location  of the user  with respect to the identified reference points. Many other components may serve to identify the current location  of the user . Moreover, the accuracy of the location  of the user  may be improved in various ways. As one such example, it may be recognized that some techniques of locating the current location  of the user  may be inaccurate; e.g., a global positioning system (GPS) receiver may detect the current location  of the user  with a specified degree of accuracy, such as a radius of uncertainty. In order to improve the accuracy of the detected current location , the device  may detect an approximate current location  of the user , and may present the approximate current location  to the user . The user  may then be permitted to specify a more accurate current location , e.g., by presenting the user  with a map including the detected radius of uncertainty, and allowing the user  to pinpoint a more accurate current location  as his or her current location . The device  may therefore select the more accurate current location  as the current location . Those of ordinary skill in the art may devise many techniques for identifying the location  of the user  while implementing the techniques discussed herein.","A fourth aspect that may vary among embodiments of these techniques relates to the manner, after detecting the current location  of a user , of presenting names  of a location  to the user . As a first example, the names  selected from the location database  may be presented in any order, including as labels of locations  on a map, as a text list of names  of the current location  and\/or nearby locations, or as one or more spoken names. As a second example, the names may be presented in any order or ranking, such as sorted alphabetically, by frequency of use by the user , or with emphasis on authoritative names  designated among the names  of the location . As a third example, the names  may be selected and presented that are within a particular proximity to the current location  of the user . In one such embodiment, for respective names  retrieved from the location database , the distance from the location  associated with the name  (e.g., from the latitude, longitude, and altitude coordinates of the location ) to the current location  of the user  may be calculated, and the device  may present the names  to the user  sorted according to the calculated distances.","As a fourth example of this fourth aspect, the names  selected from the location database  may be filtered according to various criteria specified by the user . In one such set of embodiments, the user  may specify a name query, which may specify come conditions regarding the types of names  and\/or locations  with which the user  wishes to be presented. The device  may therefore be configured to query the location database  for names  and\/or locations  matching the name query, and to present to the user  the names  matching the name query. As a first example, the name query may specify a name type filter, such as an all names filter having no restrictions on the names  of the locations , and an author identifier filter that restricts the names  of the presented locations  to those authored by a particular user , e.g., those having an author identifier of at least one specified author. As a second example, the set of name type filters may include an authoritative name filter, which may selectively specify names  designated by the location database  as authoritative names  for the location . As a third example, the set of name type filters may include an author group filter, which may limit the selected names  to those created by users  within a specified author group (e.g., any author within a \u201cfriends\u201d group designated by the user .) As a fourth example, various names  may be associated with a particular event, such as markers along a race course, and the set of name type filters may include an event filter that allows the user  to specify one or more events, and to limit the presented names  to those associated with a specified event. As a fifth example, various names  that are ephemeral may be associated with a valid duration, e.g., a set of dates between which the name  may be valid (such as markers of a location for a limited-time event), and the name type filters may include a time filter that limits the presented names  those having a valid duration that comprises a specified time, such as the current time. Additional name type filters may specify many such criteria, and may, e.g., apply Boolean logic or weighting among the criteria to produce more sophisticated queries.","Conversely, an author of a name  of a particular location  stored in the location database  may specify particular users  who are permitted to view the name . Accordingly, the location database  may be configured to associate with a name  of a location  at least one user  who is permitted to view the name . When a user  queries the location database  for a set of names , the location database  may apply the privacy preferences of the author on a per-name basis. For example, for respective names , the location database  may query whether the user  is permitted to view the name , and upon verifying that the user  is permitted to view the name , may select the name  of the location  to be presented to the user . Other types of restrictions may also be specified and applied during the selection and presentation of names ; e.g., some users  may be permitted read\/write access to a particular name , while other users  may be permitted only read access to the same name , and still other users  may be restricted from accessing the name .","Regardless of the criteria specified by the selected name type filter, the device  may then restrict the names selected from the location database  and presented to the user  according to the name type filter. This restriction may be performed, e.g., by the device  after receiving an unrestricted set of names  from the location database , and\/or by the location database  as part of the name selection. Alternatively, the names  of the locations  may be scored with regard to the degree of matching the name query, and may be presented in an order sorted by the degree of matching. Moreover, if the name type filter fails to identify at least one location matching the name query, the device  may be configured to query the user  whether to create a name  of the current location  according to the name query (i.e., to create a name  for the location  that satisfies the filter), and upon receiving from the user  a confirmation, may store the name  and the current location  of the user  in the location database .",{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0042","num":"0041"},"figref":"FIG. 8","b":["100","18","20","2","12","14","18","100","12","92","20","12","14","16","20","12","12","20","12","102","104","106","20","20","18","18","12","12","108","18","14","106","14","12","18","12","104","102","14","12","18","20","18","12","16","18","18","20"]},"Although the subject matter has been described in language specific to structural features and\/or methodological acts, it is to be understood that the subject matter defined in the appended claims is not necessarily limited to the specific features or acts described above.
