title: Systems and methods for providing a marketplace of goods subject to distressed financial obligations
abstract: Systems and methods for a financial institution to compile information regarding customer loans and items/assets securing the loans to create an environment in which troubled debtors may place an asset into a pool of assets for resale/exchange and to be released of obligations to repay the loan associated with the asset. In some implementations, a customer may replace the asset with another asset in the pool, where the replacement asset imposes a reduced (or no) obligation on the debtor. The pool of assets may include real estate, automobiles, major electronics, major appliances, artwork, etc. In some implementations, the financial services provider may be able to place an asset into the pool of goods before it becomes damaged, destroyed or goes missing by modeling customer behavior and anticipating a pending default on a loan.

{"@attributes":{"id":"description"},"BRFSUM":[{},{}],"heading":["BACKGROUND","SUMMARY","DETAILED DESCRIPTION"],"p":["Many people face financial crisis situations caused by personal or family illness, the loss of a job, or overspending, it can seem overwhelming. Often, the crisis can be overcome, but many people do not consider available options such as redefining a budget, contact creditors, managing secured loans, or credit counseling. Thus, people are faced with more difficult decisions, such as walk away from their financial obligations or have their equity repossessed. These drastic solutions are devastating to a person's credit rating, as well as personal lives.","In addition, deeper financial difficulties may involve specialists to unwind the damage. Bankruptcy attorneys, accountants and other trained experts may need to be retained at substantial cost to individuals having difficulty, which further exacerbates the problems that individuals incur during a crisis.","Systems and methods for a financial institution to compile information regarding customer loans and items\/assets securing the loans to create an environment in which troubled debtors may place an asset into a pool of assets for resale\/exchange and to be released of obligations to repay the loan associated with the asset. In some implementations, a customer may replace the asset with another asset in the pool, where the replacement asset imposes a reduced (or no) obligation on the debtor. The pool of assets may include real estate, automobiles, major electronics, major appliances, artwork, etc. The replacement asset may be of a same class of asset. For example, a vehicle may be replaced by another vehicle.","In some implementations, the financial services provider may be able to place an asset into the pool of goods before it becomes damaged, destroyed or goes missing. Further, the financial services provider may promote goodwill amongst its customers, because those customers in financial difficulty may be provided a solution to an otherwise difficult situation other than repossession or foreclosure.","The foregoing is a summary and thus contains, by necessity, simplifications, generalizations, and omissions of detail. Those skilled in the art will appreciate that the summary is illustrative only and is not intended to be in any way limiting.","Disclosed herein are systems and methods for a financial institution to compile information regarding customer loans and items\/assets securing the loans to create an environment in which troubled debtors may place an asset into a pool of assets for resale\/exchange and to be released of obligations to repay the loan associated with the asset. In some implementations, a customer may replace the asset with another asset in the pool. For example, the debtor may have a loan for vehicle having a payment of $600 per month. The debtor may find that he\/she is unable to make the monthly payment due to financial constraints. Rather than repossessing the vehicle or otherwise negatively affecting the debtor's credit rating, a financial services provider may allow the debtor to place the vehicle into the pool of goods, which is maintained within a listing database. The debtor may be released from his\/her obligation under the loan once the vehicle is placed into the pool of goods and the financial services provider obtains title, and\/or the vehicle is sold to a subsequent purchaser. In some implementations, the debtor may place the vehicle (or other goods or property) into the pool of goods and replace it with a more cost-effective vehicle (e.g. a vehicle that would incur a payment of $200 per month).","The above may also reduce losses to the financial services provider. For example, the financial services provider may be able to place an asset into the pool of goods before it becomes damaged, destroyed or goes missing. Further, the financial services provider may promote goodwill amongst its customers, because those customers in financial difficulty may be provided a solution to an otherwise difficult situation other than repossession or foreclosure.",{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0014","num":"0013"},"figref":"FIG. 1","b":["100","100","102","102","103","104","103","102","103"]},"The customer modeling engine  may receive information from loan servicing engine  and\/or other subsystems with the financial services provider infrastructure to predict customer behavior with regard to defaulting on loans. Predictive statistical modeling techniques may be applied to determine the models. The modeling process is used to create a statistical model of whether a customer is likely to default using the information contained in a customer databases .","The model may employ a simple linear equation to weigh the factors, a neural network, etc. For example, a bank is likely to take into account statistically relevant factors such as payment timeliness, account balances, increasing usage of credit cards, applications for additional loans, etc. These predictors may indicate that a customer is likely to default on a loan based on historical data maintained by the financial services provider . The customer modeling engine  may provide an indication to the financial services provider  that a customer may be likely to default on a loan. The financial services provider  may use this information to contact the customer to determine if the customer would like to place the asset in to a pool of assets for sale by the financial services provider . The pool of assets may include real estate, automobiles, major electronics, major appliances, artwork, etc.","Within the environment , there may be a first customer  and a device , such as a personal computer, associated with the first customer . In the present example, the first customer  may be the debtor desiring to be released from a, e.g., loan obligation associated with a vehicle. The environment  may include a listing database  that contains listings of the goods\/assets for sale\/exchange within the pool. The first customer  or financial services provider  may submit information about an asset to the listing database . The first customer  or financial services provider  may also opt for an appraisal that may be generated from information contained in an item value database , an external database  or customer database . The listing database  may be indexed such that it is searchable.","Within the environment, there may be a second customer  and associated device , such as a personal computer, that may be used to provide information to the financial services provider . The information provided by the second customer  to the financial services provider  may be search requests for items of interest that the second customer  would like to purchase. In some implementations, the second customer  may also submit information to a buyer preference database , such that when a preferred item becomes available within the pool of goods listed in the listing database , the second customer  may be notified.","The listing database  may include listings and details about items, such as real estate, automobiles, major electronics, major appliances, artwork, etc., presently owned by, e.g., the first customer  who may be experiencing financial difficulties and to which a loan originated or serviced by financial services provider  is secured. As noted above, the asset may be placed in the pool to release the first customer  from the obligations to pay for the asset. In some implementations, the first customer  may replace the asset with another item in the pool that will impose a reduced obligation. For example, the listing database  may provide basic information about the assets in the pool that can be searched by the second customer . For example, for real property, the listing database  may contain information such as, a number of bedrooms and bathrooms, square footage, location, etc. about a house. In another example, for an automobile, the listing database  may contain information about the make, model, year, color, etc. of the automobile. In another example, the listing database may contain information about personal property, such as diamond rings, watches, etc.","The external database  may include one or more databases of information that may be ingested by the financial services provider in making determinations regarding its customers. For example, the external database  may include, but is not limited to, economic trend data, a real estate sales data, employment data, gross domestic product (GDP) data, etc. The external database  may be any data used by the financial services provider  in its decision making processes. For example, the financial services provider  may receive economic trend information indicating a downturn in the economy. As such, the financial services provider  may decide to curtail the number of loans it originates to customers. In some implementations, the external database  may be maintained internally to the financial services provider . For example, the financial services provider  may maintain its own database of real estate pricing trends, automobile values by geographic regions, etc.","A transaction portal  provides an environment in which a second customer  may view, search and purchase assets within the pool of goods listed in the listing database . In some implementations, the second customer  may log into a website provided by the financial services provider  to accept the transaction portal . The financial services provider  may arrange for one or more of the following that typically occur when purchasing a major asset, such as a home, a vehicle, a large compliance, etc.: an inspection of the asset, an appraisal of the assets, comparison costs of the asset to other like assets, etc. The financial services provider  may then complete the transaction with a second customer .","Each of the databases , ,  and , either separately or combined, may be provided as a database management system, an object-oriented database management system, a relational database management system (e.g. Oracle, Access, etc.), a file system or another conventional database package. Further, the databases can be accessed via a Structure Query Language (SQL) or other tools known to one of ordinary skill in the art.","The network  may be any network that facilitates wireless communications, may also include wired communication capabilities, and may communicate with other wired and wireless networks. Any and all such networks are contemplated as within the present disclosure. Examples of such networks include telephony radio networks such as global system for mobile communication (\u201cGSM\u201d) networks and code division multiple access (\u201cCDMA\u201d) networks, wireless computer networks such as Wi-Fi and IEEE 802.11 networks, and wired networks such as local area networks (\u201cLANs\u201d), wide area networks (\u201cWANs\u201d), intranets, and the Internet. The network  represents any possible combination of such networks, including a wireless network that may connect to the Internet and communicate with other devices that are connected, directly or indirectly, to the Internet.","The transactions associated with the assets may involve multiple businesses (e.g. banking, insurance, title attorneys, inspection companies, appraisers, etc.). The financial services provider  provides a solution to this problem by integrating separate financial\/insurance components. A property and casualty component may handle homeowners insurance, a real estate listing service may provide listings and search capabilities of the listings, and a banking component may set up and relieve loan obligations. Thus, a collaboration of the components in the environment  may result in the aggregation of the asset exchange (i.e., pool of goods) into one Internet site and\/or one company (e.g., entity ). In some implementations, the listing database  and pool of goods may be maintained by a third party. For example, if the pool of goods includes automobiles, then the listing database  and pool of goods may be maintained by a car dealership in communication with the financial services provider  to enable the exchange and\/or purchase of the vehicle previously owned by the first customer .",{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0025","num":"0024"},"figref":"FIG. 2","b":["200","202","106","102","106","102","106","102","106","106","106","102"]},"At , the asset is placed into the pool and listed. The financial services provider  may list the asset in the listing database  and include details about the asset, such that it may be searched by prospective buyers (e.g. second customer ). The listing may be updated as more information becomes known about the asset. The asset may be physically transferred from the debtor\/first customer  to the financial services provider , or the customer  may retain possession and control of the asset and\/or \u201crent\u201d the asset until it is sold (i.e., pay for the use\/enjoyment of the asset).","At , the debtor may be released from his\/her obligations. In accordance with implementations herein, the financial services provider  may be able to resell the asset by listing it in the listing database , such that it may be purchased by other customers or individuals at large. Accordingly, a financial service provider's losses, if any, may be minimized as the asset remains under the control of the financial services provider in consideration for releasing the debtor. In some implementations, conditions may be placed on the release of the debtor. For example, the release may be conditioned on an acceptable quality of the asset. Also, the release may be conditioned on the sale of the asset from the pool of goods listed in the listing database . As such, the operations performed at  may be conditional or optional, and may occur after the sale the asset (see, ).","At , the debtor may be provided with alternative assets. The financial services provider  may provide the debtor (e.g., first customer ) and option to replace the asset with an alternative asset that is in the listing database . The replacement asset may be of a same class of asset. For example, the financial services provider  may allow the debtor to exchange a more expensive vehicle with a less expensive vehicle. The less expensive vehicle may allow the debtor to reduce or eliminate loan payments associated with the replacement less expensive vehicle. It is noted that the examples herein are with respect to a vehicle, however may be with respect to any asset placed into the pool of goods listed in the listing database .","At , the asset is sold. Once the asset is listed in the listing database , it may be searchable by prospective buyers (e.g., second customer ). The second customer  may access the transaction portal  and enter search parameters for items of interest (at ). If the asset of the first customer  is of interest to the second customer , the second customer may purchase the asset using the transaction portal . In some implementations, the second customer  may have entered buyer preferences into the buyer preference database . The preference is listed in the database  may be run against the listing database  on a periodic basis to determine if any items listed in the listing database  may be interesting to the second customer . If a match is found, the second customer may be notified at, e.g. device  that an item of interest has been placed into the listing database . The second customer  may automatically or manually purchase the item based on preferences set in the buyer preference database . For example if the item is a match to be second customer's preferences, then the item may be purchased automatically based on the price being within a predetermined range. In some implementations, the second customer  after receiving notification at the device , may log onto the transaction portal  to complete the transaction. At , the process ends.",{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0030","num":"0029"},"figref":"FIG. 3","b":["300","302","104","103","120","115"]},"In some implementations, the model may take into account the following non-limiting global factors received from external database : economic trends, real estate pricing trends, unemployment data, GDP, Consumer Price Index (CPI) information, etc. In some implementations, model may account for data in the customer database  that is particular to a customer. This data may include, but is not limited to: payment history, changes in marital status, changes employment status, changes in credit usage, changes in credit score, balance reductions in savings and other accounts, withdrawals from retirement accounts, lapsing of other products within the financial services providers offerings, etc. The information described above may be used as statistically relevant predictors within the model. It is noted that other statistically relevant information may be used as predictors in generating the model at .","At , the model is run against the customer database. The model may be run in accordance with business rules set by the financial services provider. The model may be run against a particular set of customers or all customers within the customer database . By applying the predictive model to customers within the customer database , high-risk customers showing a likelihood of defaulting on a loan related to an asset may be identified.","The high-risk customers are identified at . These customers may exhibit high debt, diminishing income, etc. Also, a set of customers may be identified as a low-risk. Such customers may be those having high net worth, few liabilities, excellent payment histories, etc.","At , customers identified at  may be approached by the financial services provider . This may include communications with the customers (e.g., first customer ) by e-mail, telephone, written mail, etc. identifying customers as may be being on the brink of financial distress. The communication may ask if the customer would like to be relieved of a financial obligation associated with the asset by placing the asset into the pool of goods.","If at , the customer chooses to place the asset into the pool of goods, then at  the process flow  described above with reference to  may be executed. In some implementations, the customer may be required to place the asset in the pool as a condition of the loan. However, if at  the customer chooses not to place the asset into the pool of goods, the financial services provider may provide financial advice and counseling to the customer at . This may include, for example, advising the customer of the potential pitfalls of defaulting on a loan obligation. At , alternatives may be suggested to the customer. For example, if the customer presently has a three-year loan on a vehicle, the financial services provider  may suggest refinancing into a five-year loan to reduce the monthly payments.","At , the customer may be placed on a watch. A flag may be set in the customer database  to more closely check the customer's loan payment status or other factors identified at . This may enable the financial services provider  quickly catch a situation where a loan may be defaulted on by the customer. At , it is determined if the customer's financial situation is deteriorating. If so, then the financial services provider may require the customer place the asset into the pool of goods as described above regarding the process flow . Otherwise, at , the process returns to  to maintain the watch on the customer.","Thus, as described above, methods and systems for providing an exchange of assets that are subject to a loan that may be close to, or in default provides a mechanism by which the loan holder (i.e., the financial services provider) may take ownership of the asset, relieve the debtor of obligations under the loan, and place into a pool of goods offered for sale\/exchange with other customers or purchasers at-large. By making the asset available to others, the loan holder may reduce losses, offer the debtor a solution other than foreclosure or repossession, and offer the debtor an alternative asset to replace the asset placed into the pool.",{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0038","num":"0037"},"figref":"FIG. 4"},"Numerous other general purpose or special purpose computing system environments or configurations may be used.
