Technical Field","This disclosure relates to an audio control system. In particular, this disclosure relates to an audio control system for a vehicle.","2. Related Art","Users may wish to upgrade factory-installed audio systems. Users may replace or upgrade the amplifiers associated with the factory-installed radios and CD players rather than replacing an original radio or CD player. Users sometimes attach additional devices or \u201csources\u201d to the vehicle's audio system. Such sources may include navigation systems, cellular or wireless telephones, AM-FM radios, satellite radios, MP3-based players, DVD players and other devices.","It may be expensive and difficult to remove and replace existing factory-installed equipment. Dashboard modification and\/or cosmetic changes may be required to accommodate new devices. Replacement devices may not fit in an existing dashboard resulting in less than a perfect appearance. Decorative face plates configured to hide poor fitting devices may not provide a professional or factory-installed look. Therefore, a need exists for an audio control system that can manage and control multiple audio sources without impacting the appearance of the vehicle's dashboard.","An audio control system may receive a plurality of audio input signals. A switch or multiplexer may switch one of the plurality of audio input signals from respective audio sources to a power amplifier. A controller in communication with the multiplexer may control switching of the multiplexer. A display may provide the user with information regarding the switching of the audio signal inputs. A user interface may permit the user to manually switch the audio source. A signal detector in communication with an audio input signal may detect a signal from a priority source. When the signal from the priority source is detected, the controller may direct the multiplexer to route the signal from the priority source to the power amplifier.","Other systems, methods, features and advantages will be, or will become, apparent to one with skill in the art upon examination of the following figures and detailed description. It is intended that all such additional systems, methods, features and advantages be included within this description, be within the scope of the invention, and be protected by the following claims.",{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0021","num":"0020"},"figref":"FIG. 1","b":["110","110","112","110","122","124","122","128","130","132","122","112","134","122"]},"The LCD display  may include backlighting and dimming capability. However, any suitable display device may be used, such as a flat panel display or an electro-luminescent display. The display module  may have a body formed of molded plastic to present an aesthetically pleasing appearance. The volume control  may provide user-adjustable volume settings and power on\/off functions. The input control  may provide system set-up functions, input labeling and input switching functions for each of a plurality of audio signal sources  through a command line interface, menu driven interface, and\/or graphical user interface.","The display module  may communicate with the input module . The input module  may be mounted in an enclosed area of the vehicle , such as in the trunk, kick panel, behind the dashboard, below a seat, etc. The input module  may receive analog audio signals from the various source devices . Such source devices  may include a navigation system , a cellular or wireless telephone , an AM-FM radio , a satellite radio , an MP3-based player , DVD player  and CD player . Other source devices may also be selected by the user.","The input module  may control switching of the various source devices  through commands from the display module . A wiring harness , which may be a unitary multi-wire cable, having connector hardware, may interface the display module  with the input module . Because a wiring harness  may be used, the display module  may be mounted near or on the dashboard of the vehicle  without diminishing its appearance. The display module  may control setting the input voltage levels and gain parameters for the audio control system  during installation, or through a user-selectable calibration process. The process may ensure compatibility between the various source devices  and the input module . The input module  may further include a volume processor  and a control processor . The input module  may provide audio output signals  to multiple power amplifiers  through an output connector block . The power amplifiers  may drive a plurality of vehicle loudspeakers .","The display module  may communicate with the input module . The input module  may be mounted in an enclosed area of the vehicle , such as in the trunk, kick panel, behind the dashboard, below a seat, etc. The input module  may receive analog audio signals from the various source devices . Such source devices  may include a navigation system , a cellular or wireless telephone , an AM-FM radio , a satellite radio , an MP3-based player , DVD player  and CD player . Other source devices may also be selected by the user.","A buffer amplifier  or pre-amplifier may receive the input from each of the inputs, respectively. Each buffer amplifier  may be an operational amplifier. A gain adjustment circuit  may receive output from some or all of the respective buffer amplifiers , and is thus shown in dashed lines. Note that each of the radio inputs  and  may be differential inputs. Accordingly, the corresponding buffer amplifier  for the radio inputs  and  may be arranged with a differential input. The differential inputs may reduce noise and increase signal quality. Some or all of the inputs and corresponding buffer amplifiers  and  may be arranged in a differential configuration.","The volume processor  may be programmed to control the respective gain adjustment circuits  to establish an appropriate input level for each corresponding audio source device . For example, the gain adjustment circuit  for the navigation input may be programmed to receive a signal in the range of about 100 millivolts to about 16 volts. The gain corresponding to each input may be individually programmed depending on the expected output levels of the various audio source devices .","A right channel multiplexer  and a left channel multiplexer  may receive the output from each gain adjustment circuit  respectively, or from the corresponding buffer amplifier  and  if no gain adjustment circuit is present. The right and left channel multiplexers  and  may be linear or analog multiplexers. The output of certain buffer amplifiers  or gain adjustment circuits  may be routed through additional pre-conditioning circuitry prior to routing to the multiplexers  and . The volume processor  may receive a right channel audio output signal  from the right channel multiplexer , and may receive a left channel audio output signal  from the left channel multiplexer . The volume processor  may control switching of the multiplexers  and  through a multiplexer control signal .","Some of the inputs corresponding to the respective audio source devices  may be prioritized. For example, the navigation input  and the telephone input  may have a higher priority than the other inputs. If the audio control system  detects an audio signal originating from the navigation input , the navigation input may receive priority over all of the other inputs. Accordingly, if the radio  or CD player  is operating, and a signal from the navigation system  becomes active, the audio control system  may control the right and left channel multiplexers  and  to immediately switch the navigation system input  through the multiplexers and to the volume processor. The navigation input  may be assigned a highest priority so that the user will not fail to hear an audio navigation prompt. Thus, the navigation input  may \u201cinterrupt\u201d or deselect all other inputs, regardless of which input is in use at the time.","A navigation signal detection circuit  may receive an output  from the amplifier  or the gain adjustment circuit  corresponding to the navigation input  to determine if a navigation device signal is present. The navigation signal detection circuit  may issue a navigation detection signal  to inform the control processor  if a navigation signal is present on the navigation input . The user may also select the navigation source  manually or through voice-command or other telemetric-based device linked to the display module .","If a signal on the navigation input  caused de-selection of another audio signal, the navigation detection circuit  may also detect when the navigation signal has terminated, and may restore the deselected audio signal. The navigation detection circuit  may delay restoration of the interrupted signal so as to make a smooth transition during switching. Such a delay may be, for example, about one to about two seconds.","The wireless telephone input  may be assigned to a second highest priority. Accordingly, receipt of a cellular or wireless telephone audio signal on the telephone input  may deselect all other sources in use, except for the navigation source . In this way, the radio , the CD player  or other audio source devices  may be deselected when the user receives a telephone call.","A telephone detection circuit  may receive a telephone output signal  from the respective buffer amplifier  (or gain adjustment circuit ) corresponding to the telephone input , and determine if a wireless telephone signal is present. The telephone detection circuit  may issue a telephone detection signal  to inform the control processor  that the telephone signal is present on the telephone input . The user may also select the telephone source  manually or automatically through voice-command or through a telemetric-based device linked to the display module .","A short-range wireless decoder , such as a Bluetooth\u00ae decoder, may couple the telephone input  to the multiplexers  and  to link the telephone . The decoder  may include an antenna  and wireless transceiver circuit  configured to receive short-range radio signals. Various wireless telephone devices may be used, such as a Bluetooth\u00ae enabled cellular telephone. Other short-range cable-free decoders may be in communication with certain unallocated input sources to accommodate high-fidelity audio signals. Some of the decoders may be Bluetooth\u00ae decoders, such as an A2DP (advanced audio distribution protocol) decoder.","A telephone detection circuit  may receive a telephone output signal.  from the respective buffer amplifier  (or gain adjustment circuit ) corresponding to the telephone input , and determine if a wireless telephone signal is present. The telephone detection circuit  may issue a telephone detection signal  to inform the control processor  that the telephone signal is present on the telephone input . The user may also select the telephone source  manually or automatically through voice-command or through a telemetric-based device linked to the display module .","Alternatively, priority levels between some of the inputs may be reassigned under software control. The user may reprogram the priority levels by selecting the appropriate function using the volume control  or input control . Additional signal detection circuits similar to the navigation detection circuit  may be provided. Signals provided to and from the additional signal detection circuits may be re-routed using transmission gates or mechanical relays, such as a reed relay, when the priority levels are modified under software control so as to maintain a correspondence with the priority input to which it is associated. Accordingly, the user may have complete control over which input source device  is selected via the input control  located on the display module . Thus, the user may chose between the various input sources.","A signal summing circuit  may combine the telephone audio output signal  and the navigation audio output signal  to provide a summed signal. The signal summing circuit  may be an operational amplifier arranged in a summing configuration. This may permit the user to hear both audio signals so that the user does not miss the navigation information or a telephone call.",{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0038","num":"0037"},"figref":"FIG. 3","b":["310","124","160","250","252","240","242","160","250","252","312","314","312","316","318","314","314","166","370"]},"A connector arrangement or jack  may couple the control processor  to the display module  using a minimal number of wires.
