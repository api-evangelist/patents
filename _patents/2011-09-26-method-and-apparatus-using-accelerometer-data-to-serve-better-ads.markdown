The non-volatile memory  can store the database  and a state of the machine learning model .","Device Orientation from Accelerometer Signals","Accelerometers provided as a sensor in mobile devices can include multi-axis models that can detect magnitude and direction of the acceleration as a vector quantity. Subsequently, these multi-axis models can be used to sense orientation, acceleration, vibration, and falling. The signals generated by the accelerometer are accessed by a microcontroller, such as microcontroller , as a type of sensor signals. Software running on a host processor can obtain these signals using an Application Programming Interface (API).","As an example, the W3C provides a DeviceOrientation API that describes two DOM event types related to a mobile device's physical orientation (DeviceOrientation Event Specification of 24 Aug. 2010). \u201cDevice orientation\u201d is defined in terms of a coordinate frame fixed in the mobile device versus a coordinate frame fixed on the Earth, where the mobile device coordinate frame has three axes (defined with respect to the portrait orientation of the display screen). As shown in , x is in the plane of the screen  and is positive towards the right hand side; y is in the plane of the screen  and is positive towards the top of the screen; z is perpendicular to the screen , positive out of the screen. Three angles alpha, beta and gamma form the angles that characterize the orientation of the screen relative to the Earth coordinate frame .","The W3C specification provides a DeviceOrientationEvent which fires whenever a significant change in orientation occurs and provides data about the three angles. An application that incorporates a DeviceOrientationEvent can perform actions based on detection of the event.","The three angles are shown in , , and . illustrates a change in position about the z-axis by an amount of an angle alpha. This change in position is referred to as heading, azimuth or yaw. For purposes of this disclosure, the change in position about the z-axis is referred to as heading, having an orientation characterized by the angle alpha. illustrates a change in position about the x-axis by an amount of an angle beta. This change in position about the x-axis is referred to as pitch. illustrates a change in position about the y-axis by an amount of an angle gamma. The change in position about the y-axis is referred to as roll. Signals provided by an accelerometer for changes in position by an amount of angles alpha, beta and\/or gamma can be used to indicate the orientation of a mobile device.",{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0084","num":"0083"},"figref":"FIG. 3","b":["300","300","302","304","300","308","306","402","404","406"]},"Mobile Device Motion from Accelerometer Signals","A multi-axis accelerometer measures acceleration in each of the three axes, and thus measures acceleration and the direction of acceleration. The acceleration in the three directions can be converted to an acceleration vector that indicates acceleration and direction of acceleration of the mobile device. Sudden and short duration acceleration is caused by vibration. Acceleration in a direction toward the Earth and at the acceleration of gravity is caused by a free falling condition.","The W3C specification provides a DeviceMotionEvent that fires at regular intervals, and provides data about acceleration and rotation rate.","Using the DeviceMotionEvent object, an application in a mobile device being held in a moving vehicle can obtain information, for example, about the vehicle traveling speed, as well as that the vehicle is traveling around a curve, or is turning right or left.","Transmission of Accelerometer Data","Data for parameters provided by the accelerometer, including acceleration in each of the x, y, and z direction, change in angle alpha, beta, and gamma, an orientation vector, and an acceleration vector can be transmitted from the mobile device as part of data provided by an application. Data provided by an accelerometer in a mobile device may also be transmitted within HTTP, in the case of a Web browser that supports HTML5.","Correlation\u2014User Position and Mobile Device Orientation","Acceleration data provided by an accelerometer in a mobile device can be collected in conjunction with observations of the position of the user in order to experimentally determine a correlation between user position and the orientation of the mobile device. Collection of data of the position of the user and orientation of the mobile device can be made for an individual user, or for a group of users of different mobile devices.","In particular, experiments can be performed in which orientation of a mobile device can be used to provide an indication of the user's position. For example, signals from an accelerometer including signals associated with the orientation of the mobile device while a user is performing actions can indicate that a user is standing, sitting or lying down. If a user is standing, experiments may show that it is likely that the mobile device is being held substantially at a horizontal orientation. If a user is sitting, experiments may show that it is likely that the mobile device is being held at an angle of about 45 degrees. If a user is lying down, experiments may show that it is likely that the mobile device is being held such that the display screen is facing downward at some angle.","Experimentation has been performed using smartphones as an example mobile device for determining a correlation between the position of a user holding the smartphone, and the orientation of the smartphone. Based on these experiments, the most common orientation for viewing a display screen is when the mobile device is held at a slight angle to the ground. However, when a user is in a sitting position, the angle becomes greater than when a user is standing. The mobile device for the most part is completely flat and stationary when it is laid on a surface and not being held by a user. If a user is sitting down at a point when they first pick up the mobile device, the mobile device may move from horizontal to an angle of, for example, near 45 degrees. If a user is standing at a point when they first pick up the mobile device, the mobile device will generally remain near horizontal, and not move above 45 degrees. If a user is lying down at a point when they first pick up the mobile device, the angle of the mobile device will generally change substantially to anywhere ranging from a vertical orientation to an angle near horizontal, but with the display screen facing down. If a user is in bed, but sitting up, the orientation will be considered as being for a user that is sitting down.","Some mobile device accelerometers are capable of detecting the height above the ground. Additional information about the height of the mobile device above the ground can be used to further indicate whether a user is standing, sitting or lying down.","In addition to information about a relatively stationary orientation of a mobile device, the motion history of the mobile device can be used to indicate a user position. For example, it has been determined through experiment that if the mobile device moves from a stationary horizontal position to a higher position, but still substantially horizontal, the user of the mobile device has likely picked up the mobile device while in a standing position. It has also been determined that if the mobile device moves from the substantially horizontal orientation to an angle close to 45 degrees or higher, it is likely that the user has changed to a sitting position.","Furthermore, it has been determined that if the accelerometer of the mobile device indicates that the mobile device is substantially vertical, but with shaking vibrations, it is likely that the mobile device is only being carried and not being viewed. For example, it may be the case that the mobile device is being carries in a user's pocket.","Once a correlation between user position and mobile device orientation is verified, the data of accelerometer parameters can be used to provide data indicating the position of the user. The determination of the position of the user can be made within the mobile device or can be determined at a server, such as ad server  in , based on accelerometer data transmitted to the server.","In an embodiment, the host processor  obtains mobile device orientation parameters from the microcontroller  and determines a user position based on ranges. In other embodiments, the host processor  obtains the mobile device orientation parameters from the microcontroller  and transmits the parameter values through the communications circuit  to the ad server , that estimates the user position based on the parameter values.","Correlation\u2014Acceleration Data and Vehicle Type","In a similar manner experimental data of information about the acceleration of the mobile device in various modes of movement of a user can be collected in order to determine a correlation between mobile device orientation and user motion. Along with motion of a user under his\/her own means, information about movement of the mobile device obtained from an accelerometer can be used to indicate a type of vehicle that a user is traveling in. Provided experiments with users performing actions with mobile devices in different modes of transportation, it may be determined, for example, that if a user is sitting in a car, the orientation of the mobile device may be comparable to the user in a sitting position. In addition, it may be determined that velocity signals from the accelerometer are above a predetermined threshold that indicates a moving automobile. It may be determined that if a user is walking, the orientation of the mobile device may be comparable to the user in a standing position. In addition, it may be determined that velocity signals from the accelerometer are above a predetermined threshold that indicates a walking or even a jogging pace. If a user is in a boat, it may be determined that the combination of orientation signals and velocity may indicate a wave-like motion at various speeds. If a user is traveling in a train, it may be determined that the orientation of the mobile device may be comparable to the user in any of a sitting, standing or lying-down position, but at a velocity above a predetermined threshold that indicates the constant steady speed of a train.","The data of accelerometer parameters can be used to provide data indicating the motion of the user. The determination of the motion of the user can be made within the mobile device or can be determined at a server, such as ad server  in , based on accelerometer data transmitted to the server.","In an embodiment, the host processor  obtains mobile device acceleration parameters from the microcontroller  and determines a user position based on ranges. In other embodiments, the host processor  obtains the mobile device acceleration parameters from the microcontroller  and transmits the parameter values through the communications circuit  to the ad server , that estimates the user motion based on the parameter values.","Database of Usage Patterns","An aspect of the present invention is the collection of usage patterns that include data obtained from accelerometers. Provided the correlation between mobile device orientation and user position, and the correlation between mobile device acceleration and user motion, data can be collected for a user position, user motion, at a time when a user action is taken on the mobile device. In addition, data on advertising type and ad format, as well as user action can be collected.",{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0101","num":"0100"},"figref":["FIG. 6","FIG. 7","FIGS. 8","FIG. 1","FIG. 7","FIGS. 8"],"i":["a ","h ","a ","h. "],"b":["8","26","8"]},"Values for data records in  represent patterns of collected data values. Patterns of values for user position, user motion, location, and environment are useful in predicting a user action, an appropriate advertising type and\/or ad media format, or for determining conditions where no ads are displayed. For example, it may be that the data patterns indicate that a video message should not be shown while the user is jogging. Provided relationships indicated by the data patterns, rules may be generated that define conditions for selection of appropriate types of ads from the ads database  to be served by the ad server .","In an embodiment, a database  of data patterns obtained from the mobile device can be maintained locally in a nonvolatile memory , and may be in combination with a database for other mobile devices that is maintained in a correlation database .","Environments for Ads\u2014Search, Display, Application","For purposes of this disclosure, ads can include advertisements of products or services, as well as messages, such as alert messages. Ads from the ads database  can be displayed alongside search results. The ads can be selected by the ad server  for display based on keywords in the search query. Smartphones that include GPS provide signals indicating location, such that the ad server  can select ads based on the location of the smartphone.","Ads can be displayed or provided as audio signals within content provided by a Web publisher. Such ads can be selected by the ad server  based on the terms found in the content. A publisher Web page can request an ad as a possible revenue generating source.","Applications for smartphones can be obtained, for example, from an app library. Ads may be displayed or provided as audio signals within the application, or during downloading of an application. Examples of smartphone applications include games, tools, music services, and data services that may be of use to a user of a smartphone.","Correspondence between data related to accelerometer signals, including user position, user motion, location, and ad environment appropriate for the position of the user is set as patterns of usage.","Types of Advertising and Ad Format, Impressions Vs. Click-Through, Conversions","Types of advertising can be categorized by type of business or service being advertised. For example, advertising can be categorized based on the size of the business being advertised. Vertical market advertisements can be used to categorize advertising as being directed to retail businesses or wholesale businesses.","Ad format can include image, photo, animation, video, audio, text, or combination thereof. For purposes of this disclosure, the types of ad format are collectively referred to as ad media format. An audio format may be appropriate in cases where a user cannot or should not look at the display of a mobile device. A still image format or photo format may be appropriate when the user can only quickly glance at a display, or a user can only focus on the display for a short time. A text format may be appropriate in a case where important information needs to be provided to the user and the user is in a position that he\/she can sufficiently read the text. A video, video\/audio, or animation format may be appropriate where a user is in a relaxed position such that a video will be watched for the duration of the video. Ad media format may include display dimensions. An example smartphone has a display device that can display a width of 320 pixels by a height of 48 pixels. Another example smartphone has a display device that can display 960 by 640 pixels. Tablet PCs have larger display dimensions. The type of advertising and ad format may be dictated by the display dimensions of the mobile device.","Actions that a user may take can be of various degrees. A user can be exposed to an ad displayed along with content on a publisher page, which is typically referred to as an impression. Upon viewing an ad a user can click through to a landing page, which is typically referred to as a click-through action. A user can further perform a purchase, which is typically referred to as a conversion.","Patterns of usage can further take into consideration the type of advertising, ad media format, a user action taken when an ad is provided.","Machine Learning Models","Correlation Between Types of Advertising\/Ad Media Format and User Position\/Location","As noted above, the definition of a user's position based on the orientation of the mobile device can be obtained through experimentation. The resulting definition can be in terms of a range of mobile device orientation signals that constitute each user position.","Similarly, the definition of a user's motion based on the acceleration of the mobile device can be obtained through experimentation. The resulting definition can be in terms of a range of mobile device acceleration signals that constitute each user motion.","Provided definitions of user position and user motion, machine learning models can be created for prediction of advertising types, ad formats, and\/or user actions, including conditions where no ads are to be displayed. In order to develop machine learning models, data is collected that correlates user information with advertising types, ad media formats and user actions.","In an embodiment, data is collected that correlates a user position, user motion, user location, and advertising type. Data is collected that correlates a user position, user motion, user location, and ad media format. Data is collected that correlates a user position, user motion, user location, and user action. This data can be stored in a local database system maintained in non-volatile memory of the mobile device for the individual user and mobile device, as well as stored in correlation database system  for other mobile devices. The database is used to determine patterns of values of user position, user motion, user location, advertising type, ad format, and user action.","Once data is collected for these correlations, machine learning models can be developed. The machine learning models can be used to predict appropriate advertising type, predict appropriate ad media format, predict user action, or predict a combination of advertising type, ad media format, and\/or user action for an individual user and mobile device, as well as for many individual users and mobile devices.","Learning rules by induction (Induction): One aspect is a machine learning model that induces rules from the data patterns. Subsequently, a rule-based system can be used to make predictions.","Learning Prediction Functions (linear\/non-linear): Another aspect is a machine learning model that learns to predict an action based on an input pattern. An example of a machine learning model that can learn a non-linear relationship between a user's physical state and a user action is the back propagation neural network.","Learning State Transitions (HMM): Another aspect is a machine learning model that learns to predict physical states from past sequences as patterns. For example, if a user changes from a standing position to a sitting position, the machine learning model would represent the temporal transition from standing state to a sitting state. Detection of a temporal transition from standing to sitting may be used to predict a likely user action.","Learning Rules by Induction","Rules that can be applied by the ad server  for selection of ads can be derived through induction based on the correlation database  of usage patterns. Learning rules by induction requires complete and consistent patterns. An induction machine learning system used in the present invention is an implementation of the C4.5 induction algorithm.  is an example of rules produced using the induction machine learning system provided pattern data collected in the correlation database . The induction machine learning system may be operated on the ad server , or on a separate computer that is in communication with the ad server .","An aspect of the rules generated from the induction machine learning system is that they provide conditions for when not to provide an ad in order to promote user safety. In addition, the condition part of a rule can include a predetermined period of time over which the condition is required. For example, a condition may be that a user in a certain position for a period of time. Another condition may be that the accelerometer does not detect any change in orientation over a period of time, which would indicate that the mobile device is still, such as placed on a table.","Learning a Linear or Non-Linear Relationship Between Patterns and Usage","Another type of machine learning model used in embodiments of the present invention is neural networks. A mutilayer neural network, trained using a learning method such as the backpropagation learning algorithm, is capable of learning both linear and non-linear relationships.  are examples of multilayer neural networks that learn relationships between input patterns of user position, user motion, user location, environment, and corresponding output values for advertising type, ad format, user action, and combination, respectively.","Each node shown in the drawings may represent a plurality of nodes, depending on the values associated with the nodes shown in the drawings. For example, the node for \u201cad format\u201d in , can be a set of nodes such as \u201ctext,\u201d \u201cimage,\u201d \u201cphoto,\u201d \u201canimation,\u201d \u201cvideo,\u201d \u201caudio,\u201d for each possible value ( shows a set of values for parameters). When the nodes of the drawings are broken out in this fashion, the data provided for processing in accordance with the neural network may be binary, where \u201c1\u201d indicates that the node is a value in the pattern, while a \u201c0\u201d indicates that the node is not a value in the pattern. For example, if ad format consists of nodes \u201ctext,\u201d \u201cimage,\u201d \u201cvideo,\u201d \u201caudio,\u201d in this order, a pattern of \u201c1 0 0 0\u201d indicates that the ad format is \u201ctext.\u201d","Connections between nodes are weighted values that are adjusted through training. A final set of weighted connections for a neural network constitutes a trained neural network model.","In embodiments of the present invention, an individual-based neural network model can be generated locally in the mobile device using data maintained in a local database . A program  that performs the learning algorithm can be executed in RAM  in conjunction with the host processor . In an embodiment, the host processor  performs the learning algorithm as a background process while the mobile device is powered on. If the device is powered off during performance of learning, the learned weights of the neural network  is stored in the non-volatile memory . Also, the resulting trained neural network  can be stored in the non-volatile memory . In other embodiments, a neural network model may be generated in a server, such as ad server , using data for a plurality of mobile devices. The resulting neural network model generated in the server would be for a general model of physical states of a mobile device and ads or user actions.","After training with known input patterns obtained from the correlation database , a neural network such as the one shown in  can be provided with a new pattern of user position, user motion, user location and environment and quickly provide a prediction of the appropriate advertising type. The neural network of  can provide a prediction of the appropriate ad format. The neural network of  can provide a prediction of the user action. The neural network of  can provide a prediction of each of advertising type, ad format, and user action in combination.","In an embodiment, processing of the neural network is performed locally by a machine learning model application  in the mobile device. Advertising type, ad format, and user action predicted by the neural network is sent to the ad server  along with other data concerning an ad request. Subsequently, ads provided by ad server  are filtered based on advertising type, ad media format, and\/or user action predicted by the neural network. In other embodiments, the neural network is performed in the ad server , and the ad server uses data obtained from the mobile device to obtain a predicted advertising type, ad media format and\/or user action from the neural network model, and use the prediction in selection of ads for transmitting back to the user's mobile device. In a further embodiment, a neural network model application  for an individual user processed in the mobile device may be used in conjunction with a neural network model processed in the ad server in serving ads to the user's mobile device.","Learning to Recognize Temporal Patterns","A further aspect of the present invention is a machine learning model that learns temporal patterns. Sequences of accelerometer data over time may indicate movement of a user from one position to another position. Embodiments of the present invention apply Hidden Markov Model (HMM) learning models to predict user action based on changes in user position or changes in user motion. Embodiments of the present invention apply HMM learning models to predict appropriate ad format based on changes in user position or changes in user motion.",{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0133","num":"0132"},"figref":"FIG. 14","b":"122"},{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0134","num":"0133"},"figref":["FIG. 15","FIG. 16","FIG. 17"],"b":"122"},"Mobile Device Ad Request Action (Search, Display, Application)","As previously described, ads can be provided on a mobile device within search results, in the context of a publisher Web page, or in a mobile application. Facilities that can request ads within a search client enable a search provider to integrate advertising into search results.","A mobile device can include a search client that incorporates supplemental code that submits a request for an ad along with a search request. In an example embodiment, the search terms contained in a search request are also included as parameters in a request for an ad. The search provider can pass a targeted ad that contextually matches the search terms. A contextually targeted ad can be returned within the listing of search results. Alternatively, a contextually targeted ad can be displayed separately from the search results, such as in a display region below the search results.","A mobile device can include a browser for display of Web pages, including publisher Web pages. A provider of publisher Web pages can include targeted ads that contextually match the content of the Web page.","A mobile device can include a mechanism for storing and executing mobile applications. In an example embodiment, code that incorporates ads in a mobile application can be downloaded at the time of downloading a mobile application. By incorporating ads into mobile applications, developers of the mobile applications can earn income from ads. Also, it becomes more feasible for an application developer to distribute a free version of an application that is ad supported.","The mobile device can detect the state of an application and display an ad at a timing that is unobtrusive to the user that is performing actions with the application. In an embodiment, an ad will be displayed when the application has reached an end state, such as when a game has finished. Alternatively, an ad may be displayed when the application has reached a transitional state, such as between stages of a game. Ads may also be displayed at the beginning of an application. In the case of audio-type ads, an ad may be played in an audio output instead of displayed on a display device.","Server System","The server system may be implemented in a network.  is a block diagram for a computer this would be connected in the network making up a server system. The machine learning models of embodiments of the present invention may be implemented in an ad server computer , or may be implemented in a separate computer or computers. The server system may include a database system for ads  and a correlation database system , which provides correlation between the data collected from mobile devices, including user position, user motion and direction, and user location, and data regarding ads, including advertising type, ad format, and user action, as in . The server system can also estimate user position from data on mobile device orientation, and estimate user motion from data on mobile device acceleration.","As can be seen in  a server computer  may include a microprocessor  provided with a cache , a read only memory (ROM) , volatile memory (RAM) , and one or more large storage devices (Non-volatile memory) , with the memory devices communicating data over a bus . The server computer  may also include a display device  and I\/O devices  that communicate with the microprocessor  by way of display controller and I\/O controller  devices.","In the case that the server computer  is an ad server , the server computer  includes an ad selection module  for serving ads over a network such as Internet . In the case that the server computer  performs machine learning methods, the server computer  includes machine learning model programs  capable of performing any of the machine learning methods of induction, backpropagation neural network, and hidden Markov model. The machine learning programs are processed using the microprocessor . Final values of weights of the machine learning models  are stored in the non-volatile memory .","Ad Correlation","The ad server  provides services for collection of data that correlates user position and motion, and user action, and stores the correlated data in a correlation database system . The collected data is used to develop machine learning models, as well as to update machine learning models.","Ad Filter","The ad server  also provides ad selection and filtering services. The filtering services are based on data collected for user position and user motion which are derived from the accelerometer signals. In particular, the filtering services can provide ads that are appropriate for a user that is walking versus a user that is standing, for example, by providing ads that are of video format or that are still image format.","Computer Implementation","There is little distinction left between hardware and software implementations of aspects of systems; the use of hardware or software is generally (but not always, in that in certain contexts the choice between hardware and software can become significant) a design choice representing cost vs. efficiency tradeoffs.
