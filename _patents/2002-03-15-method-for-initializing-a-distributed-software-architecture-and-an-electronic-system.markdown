{"@attributes":{"id":"description"},"BRFSUM":[{},{}],"heading":["FIELD OF THE INVENTION","BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION","SUMMARY OF THE INVENTION","DETAILED DESCRIPTION"],"p":["The present invention relates to a method for initializing a distributed software architecture, e.g., for a bus system for motor vehicles, and a corresponding electronic system.","Various distributed software architectures are known prior art, e.g., \u201cThe HAVi Specification, Specification of the Home Audio\/Video Interoperability (HAVi) Architecture\u201d, HAVi Specification 1.0, HAVi Organization, Jan. 18, 2000, discloses a distributed software architecture for implementing in so-called consumer electronics (CE) units and computers, such as, for example, so-called personal digital assistants and other electronic units which have a computer. The HAVi includes services which simplify the interoperability and the development of distributed applications in in-house networks. One example application of the HAVi architecture relates to CE units which are in accordance with IEEE 1394 and\/or IEC 61883 interface standards.","In the distributed software architecture according to the HAVi industry standard, control of the individual units takes place via control modules, so-called device control modules (DCM). In the case of a DCM, an HAVi software element is involved, which makes available an interface for controlling the unctions of a particular unit. Thus, each DCM is specific to a particular device or a particular device class.",{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0005","num":"0004"},"figref":["FIG. 1","FIG. 1"]},"The distributed software architecture is implemented between a platform-specific API  and an interoperability-API . Below platform-specific API , there is a manufacturer-dependent platform ; above interoperability API  are applications , as well as so-called \u201chavlets\u201d . In the case of a havlet, a HAVi Java application is involved which is loaded by a DCM or an application module, upon the query of a control unit.","The actual HAVi components can be addressed as software elements, as individual modules in the system. In this context, the software elements may in general be positioned centrally, as well as in distributed fashion, i.e., an implementation having only one entity of a certain software element, as well as an implementation which provides for such an entity in each unit, are possible. Going into details, the system contains the following software elements:","Stream manager  is used to set up, disconnect and manage links between software elements or devices. The stream manager may, just as may a registry, be set up as a distributed system. In this context, special commands can be used to query the state of all the stream managers or a particular stream manager.","Event manager  transports messages regarding state changes in the system to the communications participants.","Registry  contains information on each software element available in the network and each available device. In this context, data on the individual software elements is stored in attributes. In addition to the predefined attributes, it is possible to add further ones. The architecture of the registry permits a distribution in the system, i.e. each device may include a part of the entire registry, but it may also be supported centrally. This is invisible for access to the registry, since, if the occasion arises, the various entities of the registry independently exchange the required information inside the network.","Resource Manager  carries out the occupation and release of resources\u2014i.e. units and software elements\u2014and stores planned procedures, such as video recorder takes.","DCM Manager  is responsible for the instalment and deinstalment of DCMs in appropriately suitable devices. In this context, a standardized method for installing DCMs in Java-byte code format is available. An installation of native code (binary) is not described in the HAVi standard, but may be added as a proprietary solution.","Device Control Module (DCM)  is a software element which brings together one or more functional control modules (FCM) to a device driver.","Functional Control Module (FCM) is a software element by which a functional unit of a device, (e.g. a CD drive or a UKW tuner) is controlled. In this context, a DCM is formed from the basic functions and device-specific FCMs that are common to all DCMs.","These distributed modules, or, in a certain device, implemented modules, form a uniform interoperability API . By this uniform interface, an interoperability is achieved between applications  and the devices of various manufacturers.","The HAVi software architecture also includes a messaging system , which is used for the exchange of messages between the various HAVi software elements. Communications media manager  permits other devices or software elements to execute asynchronous or isochronous communications via the network. For example, communications media manager  runs according to the IEEE 1394 standard.","The present invention provides an improved method for the initialization of a distributed software architecture and an improved electronic system having a distributed software architecture, as well as a corresponding computer program product, e.g., for use in vehicles. The computer program product may include a computer-readable storage medium storing a computer program that, when executed on a computer, implements the above-mentioned method.","The present inventions permits seamlessly integrating additional management functions and control functions for networks, e.g., for use in vehicles, into a distributed system, e.g., a system according to the HAVi standard. In this context, the corresponding network functions are made available as control modules in the form of DCMs in one or several of the network participants.","In this context, the control modules for network functions have only the form of a DCM, but they differ substantially from the functionality of a DCM known in the prior art, inasmuch as network functions, e.g., management functions and control functions, such as in an automobile network, and not only device-specific functions, are controlled by a control module according to the present invention. In this connection, it is of advantage that the registration of the control module in a registry may take place as a DCM.","According to one example embodiment of the present invention, a control module is made up of functional modules for network functions, each of the functional modules having the form of an FCM. In contrast to the FCMs known in the prior art, the functional modules that are only implemented in the form of FCMs, according to the present invention, are used not only for device-specific functions but also for network functions.","In this context, what may be involved, among other things, are functions such as the management of current-saving modes in the network, the carrying out of error recognition mechanisms and error removal mechanisms, the carrying out of authentication and the control of an access control in the network, the execution of a broadened connection management for administering the transmission capacity and the administration of data encoding in the case of transmission of data between devices in the network.","These network functions are advantageous for use in vehicles. In this context, in conformance with the methods described in the HAVi standard for adding specific device drivers (DCMs), additional network functions and systems administration functions may be added with the aid of one of the HAVi methods, if these additional function modules have the form of DCMs.","In this context, a control module according to the present invention, depending on the development of its functional modules, plays the role of a system master or a system slave, which is also designated as system manager. In the first case of a system master DCM, the network function relates to the central control of network elements; in the second case the functional modules include functions for the local control of a device as \u201cslave\u201d, that are adjusted to the corresponding functions of the system master DCM.","According to one example embodiment of the present invention, a control module includes additional communications functions, so as to interact with other control modules. These communications functions are used, for example, for the diagnosis of the system master DCM or the replacement of a system master DCM by another system master DCM or parts thereof.",{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0031","num":"0030"},"figref":["FIG. 2","FIG. 2"],"b":["20","21","22","23","24"]},"Network user  contains a DCM for the implementation of device-specific driver software. The network user also has a system manager DCM, but no system master DCM.","By contrast, network users  and  each additionally contain a system master DCM according to the present invention. In this context, the system master DCMs in network users  and  may be different from one another, such as having different versions and\/or different functionalities.","Network user  contains the registry for registering the various devices and software elements. Alternatively, the registry may also be implemented in a distributed manner in the network users.",{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0035","num":"0034"},"figref":"FIG. 3","b":["1000","1001","1000","1002"]},"In addition, system master DCM  contains a functional module  for the authentication and control of an access control in the network (\u201csystem security master FCM\u201d). Furthermore, system master DCM  contains a functional module  for administering the data encryption during transmission of data between units in the network (\u201csystem encryption master FCM\u201d).",{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0037","num":"0036"},"figref":"FIG. 3","b":["2000","1000","1001","1004","1000","2000","2001","2002","2003","2004"]},{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0038","num":"0037"},"figref":["FIG. 4","FIG. 4","FIG. 2","FIG. 2"]},"In step , first of all, a so-called bus reset is carried out. The network users which are connected to one another by bus  (cf. ), after the bus reset, may try to become bus managers. In this context, a method according to an established IEEE standard may be used.","In the exemplary embodiment of , network user  becomes a bus manager in step . Thereupon, the bus manager, in step , registers its system master DCM in registry , using the command \u201cregister element\u201d. In this context, software element ID (SEID) as well as attributes of system masters DCM of network user  are transmitted to registry  as arguments, so as to be entered into the registration there.","In step , network user , which did not become bus manager, accesses registry , to query it as to whether a system master DCM has been registered there. This is done using the command \u201cget-element req\u201d, a search word for the system master DCM being used as an attribute.","This query is answered by registry  to the effect that a message \u201cGetElement-cnf\u201d will be transmitted back to network user , which has as argument the SEID of the previously registered system master DCM of network user . Based on this answer of the query of step  in step , network user  receives the information that one system master DCM has already been registered, as well as the SEID of registered system master DCM. Because of that, network user  is put in the position of addressing registered system master DCM using its SEID.","The object-interaction diagram of  corresponds to the exemplary embodiment of , however, after the execution of step , additional steps being carried out. In this context, additional communications functions implemented in system master DCM have the following effects.","In step , network user , i.e. its system master DCM, directs a message to system master DCM of network user . This message \u201cElementProposal\u201d includes the SEID and the attributes of system master DCM of network user . Network user  or its system master DCM can then undertake an appropriate comparison of the two system master DCMs, such as with regard to their versions and the functional modules contained.","If, for example, system master DCM of network user  has a new version number, it can be decided that the system master DCM of network user  should go to the place of the previously registered system master DCM of network user .","Alternatively, only certain functional modules in the system master DCM of network user  may be selected, in order to supplement the previously registered system master of network user  appropriately or to exchange a certain functional module in the already registered system master DCM.","After the decision of network user  or its system master DCM with respect to the registration of the system master DCM of network user  or parts thereof,\u2014if an exchange is to come about\u2014in step  a message is sent to registry  which contains the SEID of the system master DCM of network user  and the SEIDs of the functional modules to be supplemented or exchanged, as well as the corresponding attributes, as arguments. On account of this, the registering of the new system master DCM of network user  or its functional modules takes place.","In step  a confirmation takes place by system master DCM of network user  to the system master DCM of network user  with regard to the registration. In this context, as argument, the SEID of the newly registered system master DCM of network user  or the SEIDs of the selected functional modules of the system master DCM of network user  are transmitted back. On account of that, the system master DCM of network user  can address the corresponding software elements of the valid system master DCM, as they are recorded in registry .",{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0049","num":"0048"},"figref":["FIG. 6","FIGS. 4 and 5","FIG. 2","FIG. 6","FIGS. 4 and 5"],"b":["21","22","24"]},"By contrast to the exemplary embodiments of , in the exemplary embodiment of , a network user becomes bus manager\u2014network user \u2014, which does not contain any system master DCMs. In that case, the bus manager cannot register any system master DCM in registry  (cf. step  in ). Therefore, no SEID can be transmitted as argument of the message in step , upon the query of the system master DCM of network user .","Thereby the system master DCM of network user  is signaled that, up to this point, no system master DCM has been registered in registry . Therefore, in step  a message is sent by the system master DCM of network user  to registry , which is used to register the system master DCM of network user  in registry . This message \u201cRegisterElement\u201d includes as arguments the SEID of the system master DCM of network user  as well as its attributes.
