{"@attributes":{"id":"description"},"RELAPP":[{},{}],"heading":["REFERENCE TO RELATED APPLICATIONS","FIELD OF THE INVENTION","BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION","SUMMARY OF THE INVENTION","DESCRIPTION OF SPECIFIC EMBODIMENTS"],"p":["This application is a continuation of U.S. patent application Ser. No. 10\/350,606 filed Jan. 24, 2003, which is a continuation of U.S. patent application Ser. No. 10\/092,817, filed Mar. 7, 2002 and issued as U.S. Pat. No. 6,520,855 on Feb. 18, 2003, which is a divisional of U.S. patent application Ser. No. 09\/940,813, filed Aug. 27, 2001, and issued as U.S. Pat. No. 6,508,707 on Jan. 21, 2003, which is a divisional of U.S. patent application Ser. No. 09\/274,793, filed Mar. 23, 1999, and issued as U.S. Pat. No. 6,315,660 on Nov. 13, 2001, which claims the benefit of priority of U.S. Provisional Patent Application No. 60\/079,143 filed Mar. 24, 1998.","The present invention relates generally to gaming machines and, more particularly, to a gaming machine having various play features relating to a board game.","Gaming machines, such as slot machines, video poker machines and the like, have been a cornerstone of the gaming industry for several years. Generally, the popularity of such machines with players is dependent on the likelihood (or perceived likelihood) of winning money at the machine and the intrinsic entertainment value of the machine relative to other available gaming options. Where the available gaming options include a number of competing machines and the expectation of winning each machine is roughly the same (or believed to be the same), players are most likely to be attracted-to the most entertaining and exciting of the machines. Shrewd operators consequently strive to employ the most entertaining and exciting machines available, because such machines attract frequent play and hence increase profitability to the operator.","One concept which has been successfully employed to enhance the entertainment value of a game is the concept of a \u201csecondary\u201d or \u201cbonus\u201d game which may be played in conjunction with a \u201cbasic\u201d game. The bonus game may comprise any type of game, either similar to or completely different from the basic game, which is entered upon the occurrence of a selected event or outcome of the basic game. Generally, bonus games provide a greater expectation of winning than the basic game and may also be accompanied with more attractive or unusual video displays and\/or audio. Because the bonus game concept offers tremendous advantages in player appeal and excitement relative to other known games, and because such games are attractive to both players and operators, there is a continuing need to develop gaming machines with new types of bonus games to satisfy the demands of players and operators. The present invention is directed to satisfying this need.","In accordance with one aspect of the present invention, there is provided a gaming machine with a feature allowing the player to select a game token. The gaming machine comprises a processor, a selection element and a display. The processor is operable to execute a game program defining a plurality of stations about a game board traversable by a game token. The selection element is operable to select, in response to player input, a game token for illustrating movement between the stations, and the display is operable to display, under control of the processor, the selected game token at one or more stations on the game board determined by execution of the game program.","In accordance with another aspect of the present invention, there is provided a feature allowing the player to predict and wager on landing position(s) of the token identifier. The gaming machine comprises a processor operable to execute a game program defining a plurality of stations about a game board traversable by a token identifier. The feature comprises selecting, in response to player input, a predicted position of the token identifier to be determined by execution of the game program, the predicted position corresponding to one of the stations on the game board. Then, the game program is executed under processor control to determine a true position of the token identifier. The processor compares the predicted position of the token identifier to the true position of the token identifier, and a payoff is awarded to the player if the predicted position corresponds to the true position. In one embodiment, a bonus payoff is made if the predicted position was reached in response to a target movement value.","In accordance with still another aspect of the present invention, there is provided a gaming machine with a feature allowing the player to obtain deferred-execution instruction(s) which are exercisable by the processor to override later-issued instruction(s) otherwise to be executed by the processor. The gaming machine includes a processor operable in a basic mode and a bonus mode, respectively, to select basic game and bonus game outcomes. A display is provided for displaying indicia of the selected outcomes. The processor issues game control instructions associated with the respective indicia. The game control instructions include nominal executable instructions adapted for execution by the processor upon display of the respective indicia and at least one deferred executable instruction adapted for deferred execution by the processor. The deferred execution instruction might occur in the basic game and be exercised in the bonus game. In one embodiment, the game control instructions include an end-bonus instruction (e.g., GO TO JAIL) which nominally cause the processor to end the bonus game, and the deferred executions include an override command (e.g., GET OUT OF JAIL, FREE) executable to override the end-bonus instruction.","In accordance with yet another aspect of the present invention, there is provided a feature in which movements of the token identifier are determined according to movement tables corresponding to the various stations of the game board. The gaming machine includes a processor and a game memory. The processor is operable to execute a game program defining a plurality of stations about a game board traversable by a token identifier. Movements of the token identifier about the game board are determined according to movement tables stored in the game memory. Each of the movement tables correspond to one of the stations of the game board and define a set of possible movement outcomes from that station. After identifying the position (station) of the token identifier on the game board, the processor consults the movement table corresponding to that position to select a movement outcome. Then, the processor moves the token a number of steps on the game board corresponding to the selected movement outcome.","In accordance with still yet another aspect of the present invention, there is provided a feature in which escalating bonuses are awarded for reaching a designated bonus square on the game board. The gaming machine includes a processor operable to execute a game program defining a plurality of stations about a game board traversable by a token identifier, one of the stations being designated as a bonus station. As the token identifier is advanced along the game board, payoff(s) are made to the player when the token identifier reaches the bonus station, the payoffs escalating in value each successive time the token identifier reaches the bonus station.","In accordance with a still further aspect of the present invention, there is provided a feature in which bonuses are awarded for completing groups of stations (e.g., color groups) on the game board. The gaming machine includes a processor operable to execute a game program defining a plurality of stations about a game board traversable by a token identifier, the plurality of stations having at least one discernible subset defining a station group (e.g., a color group). As the token identifier is advanced along the game board, the processor identifies respective landing stations occupied by the token identifier. If the landing station is a member of a station group, the processor designates the landing station as a \u201ccompleted\u201d station. Then, the processor evaluates the station status of the other stations in the group. If each of the other stations in the group are also completed, the processor designates the group as a completed group and provides a reward to the player, which might comprise an extra \u201cspin\u201d or play of the game, or might increase the award otherwise associated with the station.","In accordance with a still yet further aspect of the present invention, there is provided a gaming machine with a processor operable in a basic mode and two bonus modes. In the basic mode, the processor is operable to display a basic game outcome defining a symbol group. If the symbol group includes a first bonus combination, the processor enters the first bonus mode and, if the symbol group includes a second bonus combination, the processor enters the second bonus mode. In the first bonus mode, the processor sets up the first bonus game by defining a plurality of first bonus selection elements including fixed values and multipliers. Then, the processor operates to select one of the selection elements and the player is awarded a credit based on the value of the selected selection element. In the second bonus mode, the processor operates to define a plurality of stations about a game board traversable by a token identifier. Then, the processor executes a movement of the token identifier to determine a landing station, and the player is awarded a credit based on the value of the landing station.","While the invention is susceptible to various modifications and alternative forms, specific embodiments have been shown by way of example in the drawings and will be described in detail herein. However, it should be understood that the invention is not intended to be limited to the particular forms disclosed. Rather, the invention is to cover all modifications, equivalents, and alternatives falling within the spirit and scope of the invention as defined by the appended claims.","Turning now to the drawings and referring initially to , there is depicted a gaming machine  with a board game theme. In one embodiment, the gaming machine  is operable to play a game entitled MONOPOLY ONCE AROUND\u2122, based on the popular MONOPOLY\u2122 board game. MONOPOLY\u2122 is a registered trademark owned by and used with permission by Hasbro, Inc. and Hasbro International, Inc., Pawtucket, Rhode Island. Nevertheless, it will be appreciated that the gaming machine  may be implemented with any of several other board game themes other than MONOPOLY\u2122.","The gaming machine  includes a video display  and a top box display . The video display  may comprise a dot matrix, CRT, LED, LCD, electro-luminescent display or generally any type of video display known in the art. The top box display  has a facing surface  comprising a partially translucent material such as glass, plastic, Plexiglas or the like which includes an adaptation of a game board  (e.g., MONOPOLY) displayed thereon. The game board  is backlit by a number of lights  (not visible in ) in the top box display . A pair of mechanical dice  are displayed near the top of the top box display .",{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0043","num":"0042"},"figref":["FIG. 2","FIG. 4"],"b":["10","82","70","84","70","14","16","18","20","22","12","72","80","36","37","70","12","14","16","18","20","22"]},"A system memory  stores control software, operational instructions and data associated with the gaming machine . In one embodiment, the memory  comprises a separate read-only memory (ROM) and battery-backed random-access memory (RAM). However, it will be appreciated that the memory  may be implemented on any of several alternative types of memory structures or may be implemented on a single memory structure. A payoff mechanism  is operable in response to instructions from the CPU  to award a payoff of coins or credits to the player in response to certain winning combinations stored in memory . As will be described in detail hereinafter, the payoff amounts corresponding to certain combinations is predetermined according to a pay table stored in system memory . A separate I\/O controller  coupled to the CPU  operates the mechanical dice  and top box lights .","The gaming machine  is operable to play a \u201cbasic\u201d game and a secondary or \u201cbonus\u201d game. The basic game is implemented on the video display  on five video simulated spinning reels, , , ,  and  (hereinafter \u201creels\u201d) with nine paylines -, as best observed in . Generally, game play is initiated by inserting a number of coins or playing a number of credits, causing the CPU  () to activate a number of paylines corresponding to the number of coins or credits played. After activation of the paylines, the reels , , ,  and  are set in motion by either pulling a lever (not shown), pressing a push button, or touching a touch screen \u201ckey\u201d on the video display .","In the embodiment of , each of the paylines - extend through one symbol on each of the five reels , , ,  and .

A-1 is a pay table identifying various winning combinations of symbols in the MONOPOLY ONCE AROUND\u2122 basic game and their mathematical probabilities and expected values. The various symbols used in the MONOPOLY ONCE AROUND\u2122 basic game include: \u201cRICH UNCLE PENNYBAGS\u201d (\u201cPENNY\u201d), \u201cDICE,\u201d \u201cCAR,\u201d \u201cDOG,\u201d \u201cSHOE,\u201d \u201cRING,\u201d \u201cTRAIN,\u201d \u201cPARK,\u201d \u201cLIGHT,\u201d \u201cCHEST\u201d and \u201cCHANCE.\u201d The \u201cWIN COMBINATIONS\u201d column identifies the various win combinations which may occur by symbols stopping on an active payline. Generally, winning combinations require that at least two of five corresponding symbols be displayed, left to right, starting on reel  (designated \u201cR #1\u201d in Table A-1) on an active payline. For example, two \u201cPENNY\u201d symbols displayed on adjacent reels  (\u201cR #1\u201d) and  would be a winning combination. The \u201cANY TOKEN\u201d combination is satisfied by any combination of three or more \u201cCAR,\u201d \u201cDOG\u201d and \u201cSHOE\u201d symbols stopping on an active payline, left to right, starting on reel  (\u201cR #1\u201d). For example, a \u201cDOG\u201d symbol on reel  (\u201cR #1\u201d), followed by a \u201cSHOE\u201d symbol on reel  (\u201cR #2\u201d) and another \u201cDOG\u201d symbol on reel  (\u201cR #3\u201d) would be a winning \u201cANY TOKEN\u201d combination.","In one embodiment, the \u201cPENNY\u201d symbol acts as a wildcard for the \u201cRING,\u201d \u201cTRAIN,\u201d and \u201cPARK\u201d symbol combinations. Thus, for example, the combination of \u201cRING,\u201d \u201cPENNY\u201d and \u201cRING\u201d on adjacent reels  (\u201cR #1\u201d),  (\u201cR #2\u201d) and  (\u201cR #3\u201d) is a winning combination.","The \u201cSCATTERED PAYS\u201d column identifies the various win combinations which may occur by symbols which are not necessarily aligned with an active payline. A winning combination of the scatter-pay type occurs when scatter-pay symbols are displayed, in any position, on the appropriate reels. In the MONOPOLY ONCE AROUND\u2122 basic game, the \u201cCHEST\u201d and \u201cCHANCE\u201d symbols are scatter-pay symbols and winning combinations occur when three or more of these symbols are displayed on consecutive and adjacent interchangeable reels. For example, three \u201cCHEST\u201d symbols displayed on adjacent reels  (\u201cR #2\u201d),  (\u201cR #3\u201d) and  (\u201cR #4\u201d), is a winning scatter-pay combination in the MONOPOLY ONCE AROUND\u2122 game.","The \u201c# OF HITS\u201d column of Table A-1 identifies, for each winning combination, the product of the number of symbols on each reel supporting the combination. For example, consider the combination of five \u201cPENNY\u201d symbols. This combination is the highest value combination in the MONOPOLY ONCE AROUND basic game because there are relatively few \u201cPENNY\u201d symbols on each reel and, consequently, the probability of hitting a \u201cPENNY\u201d symbol on each reel is very low. Specifically, in the embodiment of Table A-1, there is one \u201cPENNY\u201d symbol on reel  (\u201cR #1\u201d), two \u201cPENNY\u201d symbols on reel  (\u201cR #2\u201d), two \u201cPENNY\u201d symbols on reel  (\u201cR #3\u201d), two \u201cPENNY\u201d symbols on reel  (\u201cR #4\u201d) and four \u201cPENNY\u201d symbols on reel  (\u201cR #5\u201d). Thus, the \u201c# OF HITS\u201d for the combination of five consecutive \u201cPENNY\u201d symbols is  (i.e., 1\u00d72\u00d72\u00d72\u00d74).","The \u201cPAY\u201d column of Table A-1 identifies the amount of coin(s) or credit(s) awarded for the various winning combinations in the basic game, per unit wagered. Thus, for example, the \u201cPENNY,\u201d \u201cPENNY\u201d combination appearing on reels ,  (\u201cR #1, R #2\u201d) will pay 20 coins or credits with one coin played; that same combination will pay 100 coins or credits with five coins played.","The \u201cTOTAL\u201d column of Table A-1 lists, for each winning combination, the product of the \u201c# OF HITS\u201d value and the \u201cPAY\u201d value. The five \u201cPENNY\u201d combination, for example, having 32 hits each paying 20,000 coins or credits, has a \u201cTOTAL\u201d value of 640,000.","In one embodiment, each of the reels , , ,  and  have 48 symbol positions, thus the odds of hitting each unique combination relative to a single active payline is one in about 254 million (i.e., 1\u00f7(48)). The \u201cPROB\u201d column identifies the probability of hitting the various winning combinations in a single spin. For example, there are only 32 symbol combinations out of about 250 million symbol combinations that will result in the combination of five consecutive \u201cPENNY\u201d symbols. Thus, the probability of hitting that combination is 32\u00f7254 million or about 1.25\u00d710.","The \u201cEV\u201d column of Table A-1 identifies the expected value of the various winning combinations, which is computed as the product of the \u201cPAY\u201d and \u201cPROB\u201d values. Thus, for the five \u201cPENNY\u201d combination, the expected value is 0.0025 (20,000\u00d71.25\u00d710). The payout rate of the basic game, identified at the bottom of the \u201cEV\u201d column, is computed by summing each of the expected values. In the embodiment of Table A-1, the payout rate of the basic game is 73.60%","The Bonus Game","The bonus game is triggered when a special \u201cstart-bonus\u201d outcome occurs in the basic game. In the MONOPOLY ONCE AROUND\u2122 game, a winning combination of three or more \u201cDICE\u201d symbols in the basic game represents a \u201cstart-bonus\u201d outcome which causes the CPU  to execute a game control instruction which enters the bonus game. In one embodiment, the bonus game has a board-game (e.g., MONOPOLY) theme and is implemented on the top box game board  and video display . The board game defines a plurality of stations or squares about a game board traversable by a game token, or token \u201cidentifier\u201d indicating the position of a token, or player. For example, a token \u201cidentifier\u201d comprises in one embodiment an illuminated station of the top box game board  indicating the position of a token, or player otherwise not displayed on the top box game board . Hereinafter, references to displaying the position of a token, or player, shall be understood to mean the display of either an actual game token or a token identifier on a game board or portion thereof.","Upon initially entering the bonus game, the CPU  operates to replace the display of reels , , , ,  on video display  with a token selection screen () offering a selection of board game tokens . In the MONOPOLY ONCE AROUND\u2122 game, the token selection screen displays an animated Rich Uncle Pennybags symbol  above a selection of MONOPOLY tokens  (e.g., \u201cCAR,\u201d \u201cDOG,\u201d \u201cHORSE,\u201d \u201cSHOE\u201d and \u201cHAT\u201d), and the player is prompted to select one of the game tokens . In one embodiment, the video display  comprises a touch-screen display and the selection of a game token  is accomplished by touching the desired token on the display . It will be appreciated, however, that any of several known player control devices may be used to implement the selection of a token . In another embodiment, the player scrolls through the tokens  and selects a particular token by depressing a designated \u201cselect\u201d button on the gaming machine  when the desired token  is highlighted. Scrolling through the tokens  prior to the selection of the desired token may also be accomplished automatically according to the game program or may be controlled by the player pressing various buttons. Once the player selects a token , the CPU  operates to display a portion of the game board on the video display  with the selected token on a starting station of the game board. The CPU  also signals I\/O controller  to illuminate the starting station on the top box game board . For example, in the MONOPOLY ONCE AROUND\u2122 game, the starting station is the \u2018GO\u2019 square. The CPU  operates to display the selected MONOPOLY token on the GO square of a scrolling video MONOPOLY board on the video display , and also signals I\/O controller  to illuminate the GO square on the top box MONOPOLY board .","Next, in one embodiment, the CPU  selects an integer movement value defining a number of stations or steps which the token is to be moved from the GO square. In one embodiment, the integer movement value is selected from a plurality of movement values corresponding to the sum of two dice. In this case, the selection of the movement value might comprise selecting two integer values, each corresponding to a possible outcome of one of the dies, then summing the integer values. For example, in one embodiment, the CPU  selects a first integer value, from one to six, corresponding to the faces of a six-sided first die, then selects a second integer value, from one to six, corresponding to the faces of a six-sided second die. The CPU  sums the two values to define the integer movement value, comprising a number from two to twelve. Alternatively, the CPU  might select an integer movement value from two to twelve without selecting and summing intermediate values.","In one embodiment, the player \u201crolls\u201d a pair of dice by touching a \u201cRoll Dice\u201d key  or \u201cAuto Roll\u201d key  on the video display . The outcome of each roll (e.g., the integer movement value) is selected by the CPU  which then issues game control instructions to display indicia of the pre-determined \u201croll.\u201d In one embodiment, the displayed indicia comprise mechanical dice  and a pair of \u201cvideo\u201d dice  on the video display  (). In one embodiment, the mechanical dice  are driven by I\/O controller , in response to game control instructions from the CPU , to mechanically rotate and then stop to reveal the predetermined outcome of the roll. The video dice  similarly \u201crotate\u201d and then stop to reveal the predetermined roll in response to instructions from the CPU . The outcome of the roll of dice  ( () determines how many spaces the token will be moved from its previous position on the game board. On the top box display , movement is illustrated by the illumination, in step-wise fashion, of the appropriate stations (squares) on the game board  (e.g., MONOPOLY board) from the previous position to the position determined by the roll of dice. On the video display , movement is illustrated by the selected game token  (e.g., \u201cSHOE\u201d in ) moving, one space at a time, a corresponding number of spaces on a scrolling portion of the game board.","In one embodiment, when the token  stops moving for each roll, an animated character icon (e.g., Rich Uncle Pennybags, in the MONOPOLY ONCE AROUND\u2122 game) announces the name of the station (square) landed on by the token . The player is awarded the amount indicated on the station multiplied by the line bet. In one embodiment, the player might be awarded an additional amount resulting from a side bet, if any, associated with the station (which will be described in relation to ). In one embodiment, the bonus game continues with consecutive rolls of the dice, with the player collecting various amounts corresponding to the landing stations determined by the rolls of dice, until the player's token has completed one trip around the game board. If the rolls are initiated by pressing the \u201cRoll Dice\u201d key , the game will pause between rolls until the player touches the key  or . If the rolls are initiated by the \u201cAuto Roll\u201d key , the CPU  causes the dice to roll automatically after a small delay following the previous roll.","In the MONOPOLY ONCE AROUND\u2122 game, if the game token  lands on a \u201cChance\u201d or \u201cCommunity Chest\u201d station (square) during the bonus round, the CPU  triggers an animation on video display  which shows the top card of a pile of cards flipping up to reveal the \u201cChance\u201d or \u201cCommunity Chest\u201d outcomes. The art on the cards resembles the cards in an actual MONOPOLYTM game.

make side bets, apart from the coins or credits wagered in the basic game, on the stations of the game board which the player predicts will be landed on during the bonus game. The increments of the side bets which may be made on the various stations may be varied according to the game program. For example, in the MONOPOLY ONCE AROUND\u2122 bonus game, the player has the opportunity to \u201cbuild\u201d houses (make side bets) on the properties of the MONOPOLY board which the player predicts will be landed on during the bonus game. The amount of the side bet corresponds to the \u201ccost\u201d of the houses built on the various properties, which generally varies according to the property selected.","If the player wishes to build house(s), the player touches the \u201cBuild Houses\u201d key  on the video display  () which appears at the beginning of the bonus round. If the \u201cBuild Houses\u201d key  is selected, the CPU  operates to display a \u201cBuild Houses\u201d screen () on the video display. In one embodiment, the video display  comprises a touch-screen display and the player bets (builds houses) on a property by touching the desired property. It will be appreciated, however, that any of several alternative player control devices may be used to implement the selection and building of houses.","After selection of a property, the CPU  operates to display a property deed  corresponding to the selected property on the video display . In , the property deed shown on the video display  is \u201cBaltic Avenue,\u201d thus indicating that the player has elected to build houses on Baltic Avenue. More specifically, the player has identified the \u201cBaltic Avenue\u201d station as a predicted landing position of the token, to be determined by execution of the game program. The player builds houses on the selected property by touching the property again, by touching the deed , or by touching the \u201cBuild Houses\u201d key . Up to five bets (houses) may be placed on each property. In one embodiment, the houses on the bottom side of the MONOPOLY\u2122 board (from Mediterranean Ave. to Connecticut Ave.) cost 5 credits each, the houses on the left side of the board (St. Charles Place to New York Ave.) cost 10 credits each, the houses on the top side of the board (Kentucky Ave. to Marvin Gardens) cost 15 credits each and the houses on the right side of the board (Pacific Ave. to Boardwalk) cost 20 credits each.","The cost of the houses are subtracted from the credits previously earned or paid into the machine by the player. In one embodiment, the player may insert coins or bills into the machine  at any time during display of the \u201cBuild Houses\u201d screen as desired to increase the credits available for building houses. If the player, having selected a property and placed house(s) on the property, wants to clear the house(s) on the selected property, the player touches a \u201cClear Property\u201d key  on the display . If the player wants to clear houses (side bets) placed on the entire board, the player touches a \u201cClear All Houses\u201d key  on the display .","In one embodiment, the video display  displays a number of house and hotel icons corresponding to the number of houses built on each selected property. In , for example, the video display  shows four green house icons and a red hotel icon adjacent to the Baltic Avenue property deed, thus indicating that the player has placed five bets on Baltic Avenue. The four house icons represent the first four bets and the hotel icon represents the fifth bet placed on Baltic Avenue. The displayed property deed  identifies the cost per house (e.g., 5 credits for Baltic Avenue) and the pay value of landing on the property (e.g., 125 credits for Baltic Avenue, with five houses).","In one embodiment, the game program defines a target integer movement value and a bonus is awarded to the player if the player \u201crolls\u201d the target integer movement value to land on the selected property. The bonus comprises a higher value award, greater than the award which would otherwise be awarded by landing on the selected property. In the illustrated embodiment, the target integer movement value is two, corresponding to a roll of \u201cSnake Eyes\u201d (double ones). The displayed property deed  indicates the pay value of the \u201cSnake Eyes\u201d bonus, 2000 credits for Baltic Avenue (with five houses). The cost per house, pay value per house and Snake Eyes bonus value per house for the various properties in one embodiment of the MONOPOLY ONCE AROUNDTM game is identifed in Table A-3.","In one embodiment, a \u201cHelp\u201d key  is displayed on the \u201cBuild Houses\u201d screen. If touched by the player, the \u201cHelp\u201d key  allows the player to access various information and instructions associated with the build houses feature. For example, in one embodiment, the information associated with the \u201cHelp\u201d key  may allow the player to determine how much the Snake Eyes bonus is worth for the various properties.","After the player has placed the desired number of side bets, the player touches a \u201cReturn to Game\u201d key  on the display , causing the CPU  to replace the \u201cBuild Houses\u201d screen with a display of the MONOPOLY board screen () with the token starting on the GO square. Then, the player presses the \u201cRoll Dice\u201d button  or \u201cAuto Roll\u201d button  to roll the dice and commence the bonus game.","Then, the CPU  executes a game program, selecting integer movement values corresponding to a roll of dice to advance the game token, or token identifier along the game board. The landing station(s) of the token identifier determined by execution of the game program define \u201cactual\u201d or \u201ctrue\u201d position(s) of the token identifier, as opposed to the predicted positions selected via the \u201cBuild Houses\u201d screen. After each \u201croll,\u201d the CPU  compares the true position to the predicted position(s) and, if the true position matches any of the predicted position(s), the player is paid an amount of coins or credits, as appropriate, corresponding to the cost of building the house(s) on that property. In one embodiment, the amount paid upon landing on an improved property is five times the cost of building houses on that property. The \u201cBuild Houses\u201d award(s), if any, are supplemental to the awards given as a result of landing on the properties in the regular bonus game.","The award of coin(s) or credit(s) for the \u201cBuild Houses\u201d feature or the regular bonus game may occur immediately upon the token  landing on a particular property or may be deferred until completion of the bonus game. In one embodiment, the animated Rich Uncle Pennybags will celebrate on the display  during all large bonus awards. After the bonus game is complete, the bonus screen will fade and the video reels screen will then be displayed on the display  so the player may resuming playing the basic game.","Now turning to , there is depicted another gaming machine  with a board game theme.

B-1 is a pay table identifying various winning combinations of symbols in the MONOPOLY REEL ESTATE\u2122 basic game and their mathematical probabilities and expected values. The various symbols used in the MONOPOLY REEL ESTATE\u2122 basic game include: \u201cRICH UNCLE PENNYBAGS\u201d (\u201cPENNY\u201d), \u201cCAR,\u201d \u201cHAT,\u201d \u201cDOG,\u201d \u201cTRAIN,\u201d \u201cPARKING,\u201d \u201cWATER,\u201d \u201cLIGHT,\u201d \u201cCHEST\u201d and \u201cCHANCE.\u201d","The \u201cWIN COMBINATIONS\u201d column identifies the various win combinations which may occur by symbols stopping on an active payline. Generally, winning combinations can occur when one to five corresponding symbols are displayed, left to right, starting on reel  (designated \u201cR #1\u201d in Table B-1) on an active payline. For example, one \u201cPENNY\u201d symbol displayed on reel  is a winning outcome, as is two \u201cPENNY\u201d symbols displayed on adjacent reels  (\u201cR #1\u201d) and  (\u201cR #2\u201d).","In one embodiment, the \u201cPENNY\u201d symbol acts as a wildcard for combinations of game tokens \u201cCAR,\u201d \u201cHAT\u201d and \u201cDOG.\u201d Thus, for example, the combination of \u201cCAR,\u201d \u201cPENNY\u201d and \u201cCAR\u201d on adjacent reels  (\u201cR #1\u201d),  (R #2) and  (R #3) is a winning combination.","The \u201cSCATTERED PAYS\u201d column identifies the various win combinations which may occur by symbols which are not necessarily aligned with an active payline. A winning combination of the scatter-pay type occurs when scatter-pay symbols are displayed, in any position, on the appropriate reels. In the MONOPOLY REEL ESTATE basic game, the \u201cCHEST\u201d and \u201cCHANCE\u201d symbols are scatter-pay symbols and winning combinations occur when three or more of these symbols are displayed on adjacent reels. For example, three \u201cCHEST\u201d symbols displayed on adjacent reels  (\u201cR #2\u201d),  (R #3) and  (R #4), is a winning scatter-pay combination in the MONOPOLY REEL ESTATE\u2122 game.","The \u201c# OF HITS\u201d column of Table B-1 identifies, for each winning combination, the product of the number of symbols on each reel supporting the combination. For example, consider the combination of five \u201cPENNY\u201d symbols. This combination is the highest value combination in the MONOPOLY REEL ESTATE\u2122 basic game because there are relatively few \u201cPENNY\u201d symbols on each reel and, consequently, the probability of hitting a \u201cPENNY\u201d symbol on each reel is very low. Specifically, in the embodiment of Table B-1, there is one \u201cPENNY\u201d symbol on each of reels  (\u201cR #1\u201d),  (\u201cR #2\u201d),  (\u201cR #3\u201d),  (\u201cR #4\u201d) and  (\u201cR #5\u201d). Thus, the \u201c# OF HITS\u201d for the combination of five consecutive \u201cPENNY\u201d symbols is 1 (i.e., 1\u00d71\u00d71\u00d71\u00d71).","The \u201cPAY\u201d column of Table B-1 identifies the amount of coin(s) or credit(s) awarded for the various winning combinations in the basic game, per unit wagered. Thus, for example, the \u201cPENNY,\u201d \u201cPENNY\u201d combination appearing on reels ,  (\u201cR #1, R #2\u201d) will pay 10 coins or credits with one coin played; that same combination will pay 50 coins or credits with five coins played.","The \u201cTOTAL\u201d column of Table B-1 lists, for each winning combination, the product of the \u201c# OF HITS\u201d value and the \u201cPAY\u201d value. The five \u201cPENNY\u201d combination, for example, having 1 hit paying 10,000 coins or credits, has a \u201cTOTAL\u201d value of 10,000. As another example, the four \u201cPENNY\u201d combination, having 24 hits paying 1,000 coins or credits, has a \u201cTOTAL\u201d value of 24,000.","In one embodiment, each of the reels , , ,  and  have 26 symbol positions, thus the odds of hitting each unique combination relative to a single active payline is one in about 12 million (i.e., 1\u00f7(26)). The \u201cPROB\u201d column identifies the probability of hitting the various winning combinations in a single spin. For example, there is only 1 symbol combination out of about 12 million symbol combinations that will result in the combination of five consecutive \u201cPENNY\u201d symbols. Thus, the probability of hitting that combination is 1\u00f712 million or about 8.4\u00d710.","The \u201cEV\u201d column of Table B-1 identifies the expected value of the various winning combinations, which is computed as the product of the \u201cPAY\u201d and \u201cPROB\u201d values. Thus, for the five \u201cPENNY\u201d combination, the expected value is 0.08% (10,000\u00d78.4\u00d710). The payout rate of the basic game, identified at the bottom of the \u201cEV\u201d column, is computed by summing each of the expected values. In the embodiment of Table B-1, the payout rate of the basic game is 74.6%","The Bonus Game","The bonus game is triggered when a special \u201cstart-bonus\u201d outcome occurs in the basic game. In one embodiment of the MONOPOLY REEL ESTATE\u2122 game, the bonus game is triggered when three or more \u201cCHEST\u201d or \u201cCHANCE\u201d symbols are displayed in scatter-pay format on adjacent ones of the reels , , ,  and . Alternatively, depending on the game program, the bonus game might be triggered when the \u201cCHEST\u201d or \u201cCHANCE\u201d symbols are displayed on an active payline on the reels , , ,  and . The bonus game has a board-game (e.g., MONOPOLY) theme and is implemented on the top box game board  and video display .","Upon initially entering the bonus game, the CPU  operates to replace the display of reels , , , ,  on video display  with a token selection screen () offering a selection of board game tokens . In the MONOPOLY REEL ESTATE\u2122 game, the token selection screen displays an animated Rich Uncle Pennybags symbol  above a selection of MONOPOLY tokens  (e.g., \u201cCAR,\u201d \u201cDOG,\u201d \u201cHORSE,\u201d \u201cSHOE\u201d and \u201cHAT\u201d), and the player is prompted to select one of the game tokens . In one embodiment, the video display  comprises a touch-screen display and the selection of a game token  is accomplished by touching the desired token on the display . It will be appreciated, however, that any of several known player control devices may be used to implement the selection of a token . In another embodiment, the player scrolls through the tokens  and selects a particular token by depressing a designated \u201cselect\u201d button on the gaming machine  when the desired token  is highlighted. Scrolling through the tokens  prior to the selection of the desired token may also be accomplished automatically according to the game program or may be controlled by the player pressing various buttons. Once the player selects a token ,","Once the player selects a token , the CPU  signals the I\/O controller  to illuminate a starting station on the top box game board  and then illuminate successive stations around the board in step-wise fashion, rapidly at first and then, after a couple of revolutions, slowing down and stopping on an indicated station. Generally, the indicated station is randomly determined by the CPU  prior to the illumination of successive stations on the top box game board . At a certain point, as the light on the top box game board  begins slowing down, the CPU  operates to generate a corresponding display on the video display , in which the selected token  \u201cmoves\u201d on a scrolling portion of the game board before ultimately stopping on the indicated station. The movement of the game token  on the video display  corresponds exactly to the illumination of stations on the top box game board .","For example, in the MONOPOLY REEL ESTATE\u2122 game, once the player selects a token, the stations (squares) of the top box MONOPOLY board  are illuminated in step-wise fashion, starting with the GO square. The illumination of stations starts rapidly, then slows down and stops to reveal an indicated station of the MONOPOLY board. On the corresponding video display  (), the selected MONOPOLY token  (e.g., \u201cHORSE\u201d) is shown advancing on a scrolling MONOPOLY board and then stopping on the indicated station (e.g., the \u201cGO\u201d square in ).","In one embodiment, when the token  \u201clands\u201d on the indicated station, an animated character icon (e.g., Rich Uncle Pennybags, in the MONOPOLY REEL ESTATE\u2122 game) announces the name of the indicated station and the player is awarded an amount associated with the station. If the game token  lands on a \u201cChance\u201d or \u201cCommunity Chest\u201d square, the CPU  triggers an animation on video display  which shows the top card of a pile of cards flipping up to reveal the \u201cChance\u201d or \u201cCommunity Chest\u201d outcome. The art on the cards resembles the cards in an actual MONOPOLY\u2122 game. Generally, the \u201cChance\u201d and \u201cCommunity Chest\u201d outcomes comprise awards of fixed coin values (e.g., \u201cLIFE INSURANCE MATURES, $12), or they move the player to a new space (e.g., ADVANCE TO BOARDWALK).

game nominally consists of only one indicated outcome (\u201cspin\u201d) resulting in a single bonus award, after which the CPU  returns to the basic game. In one embodiment, an animated Rich Uncle Pennybags will celebrate on the video display  during all large bonus awards. After the bonus game is complete, the CPU  causes the bonus screen to fade and the video reels to be displayed so the player may resume playing the basic game.","In one embodiment, certain of the stations of the game board  have characteristics which identify them as members of a discernible subset or group of the stations. For example, in the MONOPOLY REEL ESTATE\u2122 game, as in the actual MONOPOLY board game, the various properties of the game board are associated with color groups: Mediterranean Ave. and Baltic Ave. define a purple color group, Oriental Ave, Vermont Ave. and Connecticut Ave. define a light blue color group and so forth. In one embodiment, additional spins may be awarded by \u201ccompleting\u201d all the stations of a particular color group. Upon each play of the bonus game, if the token  lands on a station (e.g., property square) that is part of a color group, the CPU  identifies the station as a \u201ccompleted\u201d station and stores the outcome of that spin in game memory. Then, in one embodiment, the CPU  causes the I\/O controller  to light an indicator light associated with that property on the game board , thereby indicating that the property is a \u201ccompleted\u201d property.","After each movement of the token, or token identifier, on the game board , the CPU  assigns a \u201ccompleted\u201d status to the landing station, as appropriate, then evaluates the status of the other stations in the group. If the other stations in the group also have been completed, the CPU  identifies that group as a completed group and provides a reward to the player. The reward might comprise an additional bonus game \u201cspin\u201d or an enhanced payoff relative to the base value of the property landed on. For example, if the token lands on Mediterranean Ave., which is a member of the purple color group, the CPU  assigns a completed status to the Mediterranean Avenue station and then evaluates the status of the other purple station, Baltic Avenue. Continuing the present example, if Baltic Avenue were also \u201ccompleted,\u201d the CPU  would identify the purple group as a completed group and reward the player as appropriate, with perhaps an additional bonus game \u201cspin.\u201d Alternatively or additionally, other incentives might be provided for completing color groups. For example, in one embodiment, if a player's token  lands on a property space that completes a color group, the player might be awarded double the value otherwise associated with that property. For instance, Meditteranean Avenue in one embodiment is associated with a \u201c3\u00d7\u201d multiplier, and the CPU  might cause the payoff to be doubled, effectively to a \u201c6\u00d7\u201d multiplier upon the game token landing on Mediterranean Avenue and completing the purple color group.","In one embodiment, once a station is completed, it retains its completed status (and its indicator light remains lit) when the bonus round ends and throughout additional bonus rounds until such time as all of the stations in that group are completed, thus defining a completed group. The bonus game might be played several times, by several players, before completing any station groups. Upon the completion of a group, the CPU  rewards the player as appropriate and then removes the completed status of the stations in the station group, causing the indicator lights to be extinguished.","For example, in the MONOPOLY REEL ESTATE\u2122 game, a first player might enter the bonus game five times landing, respectively, on Illinois Ave. (red), Ventnor Ave. (yellow), Community Chest (no color), St. James Place (orange) and Pacific Ave. (green), causing the CPU  to assign completed status and illuminate indicator lights associated with those properties. A second player might then enter the bonus game three times, landing respectively on North Carolina Ave. (green) and Tennessee Ave. (orange), again causing the CPU  to assign completed status and illuminate indicator lights associated with those properties. A third player might then enter the bonus game and land on New York Ave. (orange), thus completing the orange color group. After identifying that New York Ave. is completed and that it completes the orange color group, the CPU  might then award the player a free bonus spin and clear or remove the completed status and extinguish the indicator lights on the orange properties. If the player were to land on Pennsylvania Ave. (green) in the free spin, thus completing the green color group, the CPU  would award the player another free bonus spin, clear the completed status and extinguish the indicator lights on the green properties. Otherwise, any other outcome would cause the CPU  to end the bonus game and return to the basic game.","In one embodiment, the free spin feature has a relatively low total payback of 1.9%, so that players will not feel compelled to keep playing the game until completing a color group (or conversely, to immediately leave the game after completing a color group), and so that other players will not be enticed to \u201csit out\u201d and wait for machines which have a large proportion of lit properties.","Now turning to , there is depicted another gaming machine  with a board game theme. In one embodiment, the gaming machine  is operable to play a game entitled MONOPOLY ADVANCE TO BOARDWALK\u2122, based on the MONOPOLY\u2122 board game. MONOPOLY\u2122 is a registered trademark owned by and used with permission by Hasbro, Inc. and Hasbro International, Inc., Pawtucket, Rhode Island. Alternatively, the gaming machine  may be implemented with any of several other board game themes other than MONOPOLY\u2122.","The gaming machine  includes a display window  through which a player may observe three mechanical reels, ,  and . The gaming machine  includes a top box  which includes a graphics display  and an adaptation of a game board  (e.g., MONOPOLY). The graphics display  may comprise a dot matrix, CRT, LED, LCD, electro-luminescent display or generally any type of video display known in the art. The game board  comprises a partially translucent material such as glass, plastic, Plexiglas or the like which is backlit by a number of lights  (not visible in ) in the top box . As best observed in , the facing surface  of the top box is imprinted with various artwork, symbols and text associated with the MONOPOLY ADVANCE TO BOARDWALK\u2122 game, including a pay table  and instruction table .",{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0113","num":"0112"},"figref":["FIG. 15","FIG. 14"],"b":["210","282","270","284","270","214","216","218","290","214","216","218","292","270","214","216","218"]},"A system memory  stores control software, operational instructions and data associated with the gaming machine . In one embodiment, the memory  comprises a separate read-only memory (ROM) and battery-backed random-access memory (RAM). However, it will be appreciated that the memory  may be implemented on any of several alternative types of memory structures or may be implemented on a single memory structure. A payoff mechanism  is operable in response to instructions from the CPU  to award a payoff of coins or credits to the player in response to certain winning combinations stored in memory . As will be described in detail hereinafter, the payoff amounts corresponding to certain combinations is predetermined according to a pay table stored in system memory . A separate I\/O controller  coupled to the CPU  operates the graphics display  and top box lights .","The gaming machine  is operable to play a basic game and a bonus game. In the embodiment of , the basic game is implemented on the three mechanical reels, , ,  with a center payline . In one embodiment, the player can observe three symbol positions (e.g., an upper, center and lower display position) on each reel , ,  thus defining a symbol group of nine symbols visible through the display window . Payline  extends through the center display position on each reel.","In one embodiment, the symbol group displayed on reels , ,  may indicate any of four possible basic game outcomes, including (1) a standard winning outcome causing the CPU  to award the player a predetermined amount of coin(s) or credit(s) corresponding to a displayed pay table; (2) a surprise winning outcome causing the CPU  to award the player a predetermined amount of coin(s) or credit(s) corresponding to a \u201csurprise\u201d winning outcome not identified on a displayed pay table; (3) a start-bonus outcome causing the CPU 270 to enter a bonus game; and (4) a losing outcome causing the processor  to continue operation in the basic mode without awarding any coin(s) or credit(s).","Generally, both the standard and surprise winning outcomes are characterized by the display of one or more predefined combinations of symbols. The symbols and payoffs defining the standard and surprise winning combinations are stored in the game memory . In one embodiment, the symbols and payoffs defining the standard winning combinations are shown in the pay table 250 () on the face of the slot machine  so that they may be observed by the player, whereas the symbols defining the surprise winning combinations are not shown on the top box  and hence will likely \u201csurprise\u201d the player when they result in a payoff. In the MONOPOLY ADVANCE TO BOARDWALK\u2122 game, the symbols defining the surprise winning combinations are identified only generally on the top box  as a \u201cmystery blank combination\u201d which starts the ADVANCE TO BOARDWALK\u2122 bonus game. The specific combination of BLANK symbols which define the \u201cmystery blank combination\u201d is predefined and stored in game memory .","The symbols defining the start-bonus combinations are preferably identified on the pay table or other portion(s) of the top box display . For example, as will be described in greater detail hereinafter, the MONOPOLY ADVANCE TO BOARDWALK\u2122 game has two bonus features: a CHANCE bonus feature and an ADVANCE TO BOARDWALK bonus feature. In the embodiment of , the CHANCE bonus feature and the symbols (i.e., start-bonus combinations) which trigger the CHANCE bonus feature are explained in the text underlying the CHANCE icon at the center-left of the top box display .

In one embodiment, the game accepts from one to four coins. The winning standard combinations can occur for any number of one to four coins played if the indicated symbols are displayed on reels , ,  in alignment with the center payline . For example, three \u201c1-BAR\u201d symbols displayed on reels , ,  on the center payline  is a standard winning combination which will pay 10 credits for 1 coin played, 20 credits for 2 coins played and 30 credits for 3 or 4 coins played.

C-2 summarizes payoffs, probabilities and expected values associated with various combinations of the ADVANCE TO BOARDWALK\u2122 game. The combinations are designated, in order of appearance: \u201cnon-win,\u201d \u201c1 Wild,\u201d \u201c1 Cherry,\u201d \u201canybar,\u201d \u201c1 Bars,\u201d \u201canybar\/Ch,\u201d \u201c2 Bars,\u201d \u201c1 Bar\/Ch,\u201d \u201c3 Bars,\u201d \u201c2 Bar\/Ch,\u201d \u201cSevens,\u201d \u201c3 Bar\/Ch,\u201d \u201cSeven\/Ch,\u201d \u201c7-Wild-7,\u201d \u201cUncles\u201d and \u201cSurprise.\u201d","The \u201cPay\/1 Coin,\u201d \u201cPay\/2 Coin,\u201d \u201cPay\/3 Coin\u201d and \u201cPay\/4 coin\u201d columns identify payoff amounts associated with the respective combinations in Table C-2. In the case of the standard winning combinations, the payoff amounts are predetermined amounts stored in system memory. For example, the \u201c1 Cherry\u201d combination is a standard winning combination which will award 2 coins or credits in a 1-coin game, 4 coins or credits in a 2-coin game and 6 coins or credits in a 3- or 4-coin game.","In the case of the \u201cstart-bonus\u201d combinations, the payoff amounts represent average payoff amounts which may be expected in the bonus game. For example, the \u201canybar\/Ch\u201d combination (i.e., a winning \u201canybar\u201d combination with a CHANCE wildcard symbol) will start the CHANCE bonus and will pay, on average, 16.75 coins or credits in a 1-coin game, 33.5 coins or credits in a 2-coin game and 50.26 coins or credits in a 3- or 4-coin game. The \u201cUncles\u201d and \u201cSurprise\u201d combinations represent combinations of RICH UNCLE PENNYBAGS (\u201cPENNY\u201d) symbols and mystery blank symbols which trigger the ADVANCE TO BOARDWALK bonus. Both of these combinations are available only with 4 coins played and will pay, on average 98.4 coins or credits.","The \u201c1-3 prob\u201d column identifies the probabilities of hitting the various outcomes of Table C-2 associated with a 1-coin, 2-coin and 3-coin game in a single spin. The \u201c4cn prob\u201d column identifies the probabilities of hitting the various outcomes of Table C-2 associated with a 4-coin game in a single spin. Where the reels each have twenty-four reel stop positions, as in the ADVANCE TO BOARDWALK\u2122 game, there are 13,824 (24\u00d724\u00d724) possible symbol combinations. The probability of hitting any particular combination in a single spin is determined by dividing the number of possible \u201chits\u201d associated with that combination (which is a function of the number of reel positions of the symbols supporting that combination) by the total number of possible combinations (i.e., 13,824). For example, consider the \u201c7-Wild-7\u201d combination. Because there is only one SEVEN symbol on reel , one WILD symbol on reel  and one SEVEN symbol on reel , there is only one \u201chit\u201d associated with that combination. The probability of hitting that combination is therefore 7.2\u00d710(i.e. 1\u00f713,824). In a 4-coin game, the probability of hitting an \u201cUncles\u201d combination is 0.00781 and the probability of hitting a \u201cSurprise\u201d combination is 0.00195.","The \u201c1 cn EV,\u201d \u201c2 cn EV,\u201d \u201c3 cn EV\u201d and \u201c4 cn EV\u201d columns identify the normalized expected values of the outcomes of Table C-2 for a 1-coin game, 2-coin game, 3-coin game and 4-coin game, respectively. These values are computed for each outcome by taking the product of the pay value (or average pay value) associated with that outcome and the probability associated with that outcome, then dividing by the number of coin(s) played. Thus, for example, the \u201cSevens\u201d outcome has a 1-coin expected value of 0.005064 (70\u00d77.2\u00d710\u00f71), a 2-coin expected value of 0.005064 (140\u00d77.2\u00d710\u00f72), a 3-coin expected value of 0.005064 (210\u00d77.2\u00d710\u00f73) and a 4-coin expected value of 0.003798 (210\u00d77.2\u00d710\u00f74). The \u201cUncles\u201d outcome has a 4-coin expected value of 0.192211 (98.41212\u00d70.00781\u00f74) and the \u201cSurprise\u201d outcome has a 4-coin expected value of 0.048053 (98.41212\u00d70.00195\u00f74).","The payout rate of the basic game is computed independently for a 1-coin, 2-coin, 3-coin and 4-coin game by summing the normalized expected values in the respective \u201c1 cn EV,\u201d \u201c2 cn EV,\u201d \u201c3 cn EV\u201d and \u201c4 cn EV\u201d columns. In the embodiment shown in Table C-2, the payout rates for a 1-coin and 2-coin game are 0.898869 (89.89%), the payout rate for a 3-coin game is 0.908514 (90.85%) and the payout rate for a 4-coin game is 0.920673 (92.07%).","The \u201c4th coin Pulls\/Hit\u201d column indicates how many pulls, on average, would be expected to hit the respective combinations in a 4-coin game. This is computed by taking the inverse of the probability values associated with a 4-coin game.","The \u201cMax Contribution\u201d column indicates, for a 4-coin game, the percentage contribution of the respective \u201c4 cn EV\u201d values to the total payout rate for a 4-coin game. Thus, for example, for the \u201cUncles\u201d outcome, the contribution is 20.88% (0.192211\u00f70.920673). The remaining \u201cMax Contribution\u201d values are computed in similar fashion.","The CHANCE Bonus Feature","In the MONOPOLY ADVANCE TO BOARDWALK\u2122 game, if the \u201cCHANCE\u201d symbol is displayed on the payline and is included in a basic winning combination, the CHANCE bonus game begins. In one embodiment, there is only one \u201cCHANCE\u201d symbol on reel  (the center reel) and, according to the game rules, it matches only SEVENs and BARs on the payline, thus the combinations which would trigger the CHANCE bonus are: SEVEN, CHANCE, SEVEN; 3 BAR, CHANCE, 3 BAR; 2 BAR, CHANCE, 2 BAR; 1 BAR, CHANCE, 1 BAR; and ANYBAR, CHANCE, ANYBAR.","The Chance bonus game can be activated by playing from one-four coins. In one embodiment, the CPU  sets up the CHANCE bonus game by first selecting, from a weighted table, one of several possible sets of selection elements. Generally, the sets of selection elements comprise a combination of multiplier values and\/or fixed coin amounts. The magnitude of the respective multiplier values and\/or fixed coin amounts are unique to each particular set of selection elements. The selection elements themselves may be varied according to the game program. In one embodiment, each set includes  selection elements but otherwise the numbers and\/or values of multipliers and fixed coin awards may be varied from set to set. For example, one of the sets of selection elements might include 2\u00d7, 3\u00d7, 4\u00d7, 5\u00d7 and 10\u00d7 multipliers, and 2, 5, 10, 20, and 25 coin awards, whereas another set might include 2\u00d7, 3\u00d7, 4\u00d7, 5\u00d7 and 10\u00d7 multipliers and 5, 10, 25, 50 and 100 coin awards. Still another set might include 2\u00d7, 3\u00d7, 5\u00d7 and 10\u00d7 multipliers and 2, 5, 10, 25, 50 and 100 coin awards.","In one embodiment, as shown in , the CPU  causes the selected set of selection elements to be displayed on the graphics display  in roughly an oval shape around a center area where messages are displayed. In the illustrated embodiment, the message area prompts the player to \u201cPRESS \u2018SPIN REELS\u2019 TO WIN THE CHANCE BONUS.\u201d From the display screen shown in , the CHANCE bonus is initiated by the player pressing the \u201cSpin Reels\u201d button or pulling a lever (not shown). The CPU  then operates according to its game program (stored in system memory ) to randomly select one of the selection elements from the set. In one embodiment, the various selection elements have generally different probabilities of being selected, as determined by a table stored in system memory . In one embodiment having a set of selection elements including 2\u00d7, 3\u00d7, 4\u00d7, 5\u00d7 and 10\u00d7 multipliers and 2, 5, 10, 20 and 25 coin awards, the probabilities of selecting the respective selection elements are: 0.219231 for the 2\u00d7 multiplier; 0.153846 for the 3\u00d7 multiplier; 0.061538 for the 4\u00d7 multiplier; 0.053846 for the 5\u00d7 multiplier; 0.069231 for the 10\u00d7 multiplier; 0.126923 for the 2 coin award; 0.138462 for the 5coin award; 0.076923 for the 10 coin award; 0.042308 for the 20 coin award; and 0.057692 for the 25 coin award.","In one embodiment, the selection of the CHANCE bonus award element is depicted on the graphic display  by highlighting, one at a time, consecutive selection elements in a clockwise sequence, quickly at first and then slowing down and stopping to reveal the selected award element, which might be a fixed coin amount or a multiplier. At this point, the message area will display the total amount of coins or credits won. For example, if the award from the basic game reels was 10 credits, and the highlight stopped on a 25 Coin amount, the message area will contain \u201c10+25=35 COINS\u201d. If, however, the award from the basic game reels was 10 credits, and the highlight stopped on a 4\u00d7 multiplier, the message area will contain \u201c10\u00d74=40 COINS\u201d. The game would then total the amount won on the win meter and show a total screen on the display  announcing how many coins were won in the CHANCE bonus game. If the amount won is over the selected handpay level, a jackpot display and animation will then be shown on the display . In one embodiment, after the amount won is credited or payed out, the CHANCE bonus feature ends and the game returns to the basic game.","In one embodiment of a 4-coin game, the coin awards are multiplied by two for two coins bet and multiplied by three for three or four coins were bet. The fourth coin allows the player the opportunity to play the MONOPOLY ADVANCE TO BOARDWALK\u2122 bonus game and does not increase the value of the CHANCE bonus.","The ADVANCE TO BOARDWALK\u2122 Bonus Game","In one embodiment, the CPU  enters the ADVANCE TO BOARDWALK\u2122 bonus game when the player is betting four coins and a special \u201cstart-bonus\u201d combination of three RICH UNCLE PENNYBAGS (\u201cPENNY\u201d) symbols occurs on the reels , , , in scatter-pay format, in the basic game. As described earlier, scatter-pay format means that the scatter pay symbols (e.g., \u201cPENNY\u201d symbols in the ADVANCE TO BOARDWALK\u2122 game) may be displayed in either the upper, lower or center position on the respective reels.","The ADVANCE TO BOARDWALK\u2122 bonus game has a board-game (e.g., MONOPOLY) theme and is implemented on the top box game board  and graphics display . Upon initially entering the bonus game, the CPU  causes an introductory animation to be displayed on the graphics display  with an audio fanfare and then signals I\/O controller  to illuminate the GO square on the top box MONOPOLY board . The player is prompted to spin the reels to to play the bonus game. Then, in one embodiment, the CPU  operates to select an integer-value movement indicator and causes the selected movement indicator to be displayed on the graphics display .","In one embodiment, the movement indicator is not immediately shown on the graphics display  but is revealed slowly so as to heighten the player's anticipation of the indicator. In one embodiment, the graphics display  shows the movement indicator on a display field which is intentionally fuzzy or cloudy at first, so as to \u201chide\u201d the indicator but which is slowly cleared up to reveal the selected indicator. In one embodiment of the MONOPOLY ADVANCE TO BOARDWALK\u2122 game, for example, the graphics display shows an animation of a Rich Uncle Pennybags character seated at a desk-type \u201ccontrol panel.\u201d A message area on the control panel includes an animated computer or television-type monitor adapted to reveal the selected indicator. The monitor is filled with \u201cstatic\u201d at first so as to obscure the movement indicator. For example, the message area on the control panel might read, \u201cYOU MOVE [blank] SPACES,\u201d where the blank is filled in by the number to be displayed on the monitor. After a short time, the Rich Uncle Pennybags character twiddles dials and levers on the control board to clear up the static and reveal the selected indicator. At this point, for example, the message area might read \u201cYOU MOVE [7] SPACES,\u201d where the \u201c7\u201d is displayed on the animated monitor.","In one embodiment, the movement indicator (e.g., \u201c7\u201d) identifies an amount of spaces, from two to twelve, which the token will be moved from its previous position on the game board, in much the same manner as would a roll of dice. In one embodiment, the CPU  selects the movement indicator pseudo-randomly, that is, certain indicator values might occur more frequently than other indicator values, depending on the space the player is presently \u201con.\u201d For example, the CPU  might be more likely to select a movement indicator of \u201c7\u201d if the player were on INDIANA AVENUE (thus landing the player on GO TO JAIL), than if the player were on ILLINOIS AVENUE. In one embodiment, a plurality of movement tables is stored in game memory, wherein each movement table corresponds to a particular square of the MONOPOLY board. The CPU  selects, from the movement table corresponding to present space, a movement indicator by first picking a random number, then consulting the movement table to determine the movement indicator corresponding to the random number.","In one embodiment, the movement tables define, for each square, a number of occurrences of each possible outcome from two to twelve. For example, one movement table might define a set of 46 possible occurrences, including 2 occurrences associated with a movement of 2 spaces, 2 occurrences associated with a movement of 3 spaces, 3 occurrences associated with a movement of 4 spaces, 5 occurrences associated with a movement of 5 spaces, 8 occurrences associated with a movement of 6 spaces, 6 occurrences associated with a movement of 7 spaces, 5 occurrences associated with a movement of 8 spaces, 7 occurrences associated with a movement of 9 spaces, 6 occurrences associated with a movement of 10 spaces, 1 occurrence associated with a movement of 11 spaces and 1 occurrence associated with a movement of 12 spaces.","The CPU  might select a movement indicator from the example table by selecting a random number from one to 46, then stepping through each occurrence until it finds the movement indicator corresponding to that random number. For example, for the example movement table above, a random number of 5 might indicate that the selected movement indicator would be \u201c4,\u201d since the first two \u201cstep throughs\u201d are 2, the next two \u201cstep throughs\u201d are 3 and the fifth step ends on an indicator of 4.","After the selection of a movement indicator number and display of the indicator on the graphics display , the CPU  operates to illuminate, one space at a time, the appropriate squares on the game board  (e.g., MONOPOLY board) from the previous position to the position determined by the movement indicator.","In one embodiment, when the lights stops moving for each roll, an animated character icon (e.g., Rich Uncle Pennybags) on the graphics display  announces the name of the square landed on and the amount of coins or credits, if any, associated with the square. In one embodiment, the bonus game continues with consecutive selections of movement indicators, and corresponding movement around the game board, until the player \u201clands\u201d on a designated square which ends the bonus game. In one embodiment, the CPU  will end the bonus game if the player lands on the IN JAIL, INCOME TAX or LUXURY TAX squares, otherwise will continue the bonus game.","If the player lands on an ELECTRIC COMPANY, WATER WORKS or FREE PARKING square during the bonus round, the CPU  selects a win amount from a plurality of possible win amounts associated with the square. In one embodiment, the CPU  triggers an appropriate animation on the graphics display  to illustrate the selection of a win amount. ,  and , show exemplary displays which might occur in response to the player landing on WATER WORKS, ELECTRIC COMPANY or FREE PARKING, respectively.","Generally, each of the WATER WORKS, ELECTRIC COMPANY and FREE PARKING displays show a pre-selected award value and a number of other, different values at various graphical locations. The display animation appears to \u201cselect\u201d an award value, which has already been pre-selected by the CPU , by pointing to the pre-selected value or \u201cerasing\u201d the other values. In  (WATER WORKS), for example, there are four possible award values (e.g., 5, 10, 25 and 50) displayed at four graphical locations (e.g., underneath four pipes). An animated Rich Uncle Pennybags character turns a valve, causing water to come out of one of the pipes and \u201cwash away\u201d the underlying displayed value. He will do this three times, causing three of the award values to be \u201cwashed away,\u201d and the player will be awarded the remaining award value. In  (ELECTRIC COMPANY), there are four possible award values (e.g., 5, 20, 25 and 50) displayed on four light bulbs. An animated Rich Uncle Pennybags character presses a button, causing one of the light bulbs to light up then explode, so as to erase the award value associated with the exploded bulb. As in , he will do this three times, causing three of the award values to be erased, and the player will be awarded the remaining award value. In  (FREE PARKING), there are seven possible award values (e.g., 10, 15, 20, 25, 50, 100 and 200) displayed on an animated parking meter. A pointer in the parking meter moves back and forth, then slowly comes to a stop so as to point to one of the award values, and the player is awarded the indicated award value.","In one embodiment, the indicated award values for the ELECTRIC COMPANY, WATER WORKS and FREE PARKING squares are pre-selected by the CPU  from weighted tables of award values stored in game memory. The CPU  selects, from the award table corresponding to the ELECTRIC COMPANY, WATER WORKS or FREE PARKING space, an award by first picking a random number, then consulting the appropriate award table to determine the award corresponding to the random number.","Suppose, for example, an ELECTRIC COMPANY square has five possible awards: 5, 10, 20, 25 or 50 coins. An award table associated with the ELECTRIC COMPANY square might define a set of eight possible occurrences of the various awards: 2 occurrences associated with an award of 5 coins, 2 occurrences associated with an award of 10 coins, 2 occurrences associated with an award of 20 coins, 1 occurrence associated with an award of 25 coins and 1 occurrence associated with an award of 50 coins. The CPU  might select an award from the award table by selecting a random number from one to 8, then stepping through each occurrence until it finds the award corresponding to that random number. Continuing the above example, a random number of 5 might indicate that the selected award would be 20 coins, since the first two \u201cstep throughs\u201d are 5 coins, the next two \u201cstep throughs\u201d are 10 coins and the next step ends on an award of 20 coins.","Similarly, suppose the FREE PARKING square has seven possible awards: 10, 15, 20, 25, 50, 100 and 200 coins. An award table associated with the FREE PARKING square might define a set of nine possible occurrences of the various awards: 1 occurrence associated with an award of 10 coins, 1 occurrence associated with an award of 15 coins, 2 occurrences associated with an award of 20 coins, 2 occurrences associated with an award of 25 coins, 1 occurrence associated with an award of 50 coins, 1 occurrence associated with an award of 100 coins and 1 occurrence associated with an award of 200 coins. The CPU  might select an award from the award table by selecting a random number from one to 9, then stepping through each occurrence until it finds the award corresponding to that random number. Continuing the above example, a random number of 5 might indicate that the selected award would be 25 coins, since the first \u201cstep through\u201d is 10 coins, the next \u201cstep through\u201d is 15 coins, the next two \u201cstep throughs\u201d are 20 coins and the next step ends on an award of 25 coins.","If the player lands on CHANCE or COMMUNITY CHEST, the CPU  triggers an animation on graphics display  which shows the top card of a pile of cars flipping up to reveal the \u201cChance\u201d or \u201cCommunity Chest\u201d outcomes. The art on the cards resembles the cards in an actual MONOPOLY\u2122 game. Generally, the \u201cChance\u201d and \u201cCommunity Chest\u201d outcomes comprise awards of fixed coin values (e.g., \u201cBANK PAYS YOU DIVIDEND OF 25 COINS\u201d), or move the player to a new space (e.g., ADVANCE TO NEAREST RAILROAD). If the player is moved to a property, the movement is indicated on the top box board  and an animation associated with the property is shown on the graphics display .","If the player draws a GO TO NEAREST UTILITY card, the light will move to either ELECTRIC COMPANY or WATER WORKS clockwise (whichever is nearest). In one embodiment, if movement to the nearest utility causes the player to pass GO, the player will be awarded a \u201cpassing GO bonus,\u201d in addition to the award, if any, associated with the nearest utility.","If the player draws a GO TO JAIL card, the game will play an animation of RICH UNCLE PENNYBAGS going to jail, and the light will quickly move counter-clockwise to the IN JAIL space. If the player stops on LUXURY TAX, INCOME TAX or IN JAIL, the display  will show an appropriate animation including a display of the total coins won in the bonus game. The CPU  will cause the payoff mechanism  to award coins or credits as appropriate, corresponding to the amount won in the bonus game and then return to the basic spinning reel game.","In one embodiment, a bonus is awarded whenever the player passes, or lands on, the GO square. As best observed in , the bonuses are enumerated by a number of indicator lights  on the top box MONOPOLY board . In the illustrated embodiment, there are seven indicator lights associated with escalating 5, 10, 25, 100, 150, 500 and 1,500 coin bonuses. When the game begins, the player receives an automatic 5 coin bonus for being on GO and, accordingly, the 5 COIN indicator is lit on the board . If the player passes GO on his first cycle 1 around the board, the 10 COIN indicator will light, and the player will be awarded with 10 coins. If the player cycles around the board again, then the 25 COIN indicator will light, and the player will be awarded with 25 coins. If the player continues to pass GO a third, fourth, fifth and sixth time, the respective 100 COIN, 150 COIN, 500 COIN and 1500 COIN bonus indicators will become lit and the player will be awarded with 100 coins, 1150 coins, 500 coins and 1500 coins respectively.","In one embodiment, the board may be cycled a maximum of six times. If a player successfully cycles the board six times, the bonus game will end and player will receive all accumulated awards, plus the 1500 coin bonus, plus the award, if any, associated with the final space. If the final space causes the player to move to another square (e.g., GO TO NEAREST UTILITY), the player will be awarded the bonus, if any associated with that other square. For example, suppose the player has completed five trips around the board and has accumulated 1754 coins or credits so far in the bonus game. Suppose further that the player is currently on PARK PLACE and Rich Uncle Pennybags selects a movement indicator of \u201c5,\u201d causing the player to pass GO and land on the COMMUNITY CHEST square. The player will be awarded the 1500 coin bonus for passing GO the sixth time plus an amount associated with the COMMUNITY CHEST square. Continuing the example, suppose Rich Uncle Pennybags selects a COMMUNITY CHEST card of GO TO NEAREST UTILITY. The player will move to the next utility, ELECTRIC COMPANY, and will be awarded a selected value, say 25 coins. The bonus game will end after displaying, and then paying (in the present example), a win amount of 3279 coins (e.g., 1754+1500+25).","Now turning to , there is depicted another gaming machine  with a board game theme.

In one embodiment, the game accepts from one to four coins. The winning standard combinations can occur for any number of one to four coins played if the indicated symbols are displayed on reels , ,  in alignment with the center payline . For example, three \u201c1-BAR\u201d symbols displayed on reels , ,  on the center payline  is a standard winning combination which will pay 10 credits for 1 coin played, 20 credits for 2 coins played and 30 credits for 3 or 4 coins played. The \u201cAnyBar\u201d combination is satisfied by any combination of three or more \u201c1-BAR,\u201d \u201c2-BAR\u201d and \u201c3-BAR\u201d symbols stopping on the center payline .","In one embodiment, the \u201cWILD\u201d and \u201cWILD DICE\u201d symbols acts as wildcards for any other symbol on the payline . Where the \u201cWILD\u201d symbol is used to complete a winning combination, the payout will be the same as the standard winning combination as if completed without the WILD symbol. Thus, for example, the combination of \u201c2-BAR,\u201d \u201cWILD\u201d and \u201c2-BAR\u201d is a standard winning combination which would pay the same as the combination of three \u201c2-BAR\u201d symbols, corresponding to the number of coins played. Where the \u201cWILD DICE\u201d symbol is used to complete a winning combination, the ROLL THE DICE FEATURE is triggered to identify a multiplier value, as heretofore described, and the multiplier value is used to multiply the amount otherwise associated with the combination.","The ROLL THE DICE Multiplier Feature","In the MONOPOLY ROLL & WIN\u2122 game, if the \u201cWILD DICE\u201d symbol is displayed on the payline  and is included in a wining combination, the ROLL THE DICE multiplier feature begins. In one embodiment, there is only one \u201cWILD DICE\u201d symbol on reel  (the center reel) and the combinations which would trigger the ROLL THE DICE feature are: SEVEN, WILD DICE, SEVEN; 3 BAR, WILD DICE, 3 BAR; 2 BAR, WILD DICE, 2 BAR; 1 BAR, WILD DICE, 1 BAR; ANYBAR, WILD DICE, ANYBAR and PENNY, WILD DICE, PENNY. The PENNY, WILD DICE, PENNY combination also triggers the ROLL & WIN bonus game, to be described later.","The ROLL THE DICE feature can be activated by playing from one-four coins. When the WILD DICE symbol appears in a standard winning combination, the CPU  activates the ROLL THE DICE feature by randomly selecting a multiplier value, then multiplies the base amount associated with the standard winning combination by the selected multiplier value. When the WILD DICE symbol appears in the PENNY, WILD DICE, PENNY combination, a \u201cstart-bonus\u201d combination which also triggers the ROLL & WIN bonus game, the CPU  enters the ROLL & WIN bonus game first and then, after the bonus game has ended, randomly selects a multiplier value and multiplies the amount won in the bonus game by the selected multiplier value.","In one embodiment, the CPU  selects the multiplier value by selecting a number corresponding to the roll of two six-sided dice. This is accomplished in one embodiment by randomly selecting two integer values from one to six (each corresponding to a roll of a single six-sided die), then summing the integer values to arrive at the multiplier value. Specifically, there are 36 possible outcomes of the two integer values which might occur: (1,1), (1,2), (1,3), (1,4), (1,5), (1,6), (2,1), (2,2), (2,3), (2,4), (2,5), (2,6), (3,1), (3,2), (3,3), (3,4), (3,5), (3,6), (4,1), (4,2), (4,3), (4,4), (4,5), (4,6), (5,1), (5,2), (5,3), (5,4), (5,5), (5,6), (6,1), (6,2), (6,3), (6,4), (6,5) and (6,6). These outcomes correspond to 11 possible sums: 2 (1 occurrence), 3 (2 occurrences), 4 (3 occurrences), 5 (4 occurrences), 6 (5 occurrences), 7 (6 occurrences), 8 (5 occurrences), 9 (4 occurrences), 10 (3 occurrences), 11 (2 occurrences) and 12 (1 occurrence).","In one embodiment, each of the possible outcomes of integer values (corresponding to the roll of two dice) has an equal probability of occurrence and consequently, the probability of the CPU  selecting the various multiplier values (corresponding to the sum of two fair dice) is as follows: 2.7% (i.e., 1\u00f736) for the \u201c2\u00d7\u201d and \u201c12\u00d7\u201d multipliers; 5.5% (i.e., 2\u00f736) for the \u201c3\u00d7\u201d and \u201c11\u00d7\u201d multipliers; 8.3% (i.e., 3\u00f736) for the \u201c4\u00d7\u201d and \u201c10\u00d7\u201d multipliers; 11.1% (i.e., 4\u00f736) for the \u201c5\u00d7\u201d and \u201c9\u00d7\u201d multipliers; 13.9% (i.e., 5\u00f736) for the \u201c6\u00d7\u201d and \u201c8\u00d7\u201d multipliers; and 16.7% (i.e., 6\u00f736) for the \u201c7\u00d7\u201d multiplier.","In one embodiment, the selection of the ROLL THE DICE multiplier is depicted both graphically, on the graphic display  and mechanically, by the mechanical dice . On the graphics display , the CPU  generates a display of two dice which are rolling at first, then stop, one at a time to reveal two die faces. The die faces selected for display correspond to the integer values from one to six selected by the CPU . For example, having selected integer values of \u201c1\u201d and \u201c6,\u201d the CPU  will display a pair of dice, one of which indicates a roll of \u201c1\u201d and the other indicating a roll of \u201c6.\u201d The CPU  then adds the two integer values to determine the multiplier value (e.g., \u201c7\u00d7\u201d) which in one embodiment is displayed adjacent to the two die faces on the graphics display . Similarly, the CPU  causes the two mechanical dice  to rotate or \u201croll\u201d at first, then stop, one at a time to reveal two die faces. The die faces on the mechanical dice  correspond to the die faces on the graphics display .","Then, the CPU  then generates a screen on the graphics display  showing the total win. For example, suppose a \u201c7\u00d7\u201d multiplier is selected by the CPU  in a ROLL THE DICE feature which resulted from a SEVEN, WILD DICE, SEVEN symbol combination. In one embodiment, the graphics display shows the basic win amount associated with the SEVEN, WILD DICE, SEVEN symbol combination (e.g., 150 coins with 3 coins played), the selected multiplier (e.g., \u201c7\u00d7\u201d) and the product of the multiplier and basic win amount (e.g., 1050 coins).","The ROLL & WIN\u2122 Bonus Game","In one embodiment, the CPU  enters the ROLL & WIN\u2122 bonus game when the player is betting four coins and a special \u201cstart-bonus\u201d combination of three RICH UNCLE PENNYBAGS (\u201cPENNY\u201d) symbols occurs on the center payline  of reels , ,  in the basic game. The ROLL & WIN\u2122 bonus game has a board-game (e.g., MONOPOLY) theme and is implemented on the top box game board  and graphics display . Upon initially entering the bonus game, the CPU  causes an introductory animation to be displayed on the graphics display  with a musical jingle and then operates to display an animation of a game token traveling around a MONOPOLY board. The CPU  also signals I\/O controller  to illuminate the appropriate to illuminate a starting square on the top box game board  and then illuminate successive squares around the board in step-wise fashion, rapidly at first and then, after a couple of revolutions, slowing down and stopping on an indicated square. Generally, the indicated square is randomly determined by the CPU  prior to the illumination of successive squares on the top box game board .","In one embodiment, when the player \u201clands\u201d on the indicated square, the graphics display  shows an animation for that square. As best observed in , the squares of the game board  in one embodiment of the MONOPOLY ROLL & WIN game are: \u201cGO,\u201d \u201cBALTIC & MEDITTERANEAN AVENUE\u201d (hereinafter \u201cBALTIC\u201d), \u201cREADING & PENNSYLVANIA & B. & O. & SHORT LINE RAILROAD\u201d (hereinafter \u201cRAILROAD\u201d), \u201cCONNECTICUT & VERMONT & ORIENTAL AVENUE\u201d (hereinafter \u201cVERMONT\u201d), \u201cIN JAIL,\u201d \u201cVIRGINIA & STATES AVENUE & ST.

If the player is moved to a property, the movement is indicated on the top box board , an animation of the property is shown on the graphics display  and the player is awarded an amount, if any associated with the square. In one embodiment, the CPU  returns to the basic game after landing on a property square.

Generally, the CHANCE and COMMUNITY CHEST outcomes include awards of fixed coin values (e.g., \u201cLIFE INSURANCE MATURES,\u201d $100) or instructions for movement to a particular square (e.g., ADVANCE TO BOARDWALK), where the indicated square is associated with a fixed coin award. As identified in Table D-3, the COMMUNITY CHEST outcomes range in value between 10 coins or credits (e.g., \u201cBEAUTY CONTEST\u201d, 10 coins) to a maximum of 200 coins or credits (e.g., ADVANCE TO GO, and BANK ERROR IN YOUR FAVOR). The average value of the COMMUNITY CHEST square is 62.4 coins or credits. As identified in Table D-4, the CHANCE outcomes range in value between 10 coins or credits (e.g., \u201cDOG SHOW\u201d, 10 coins) to a maximum of 1000 coins or credits (e.g., ADVANCE TO BOARDWALK).","In one embodiment, the likelihood of landing on a particular square is predefined and stored in an occurrence probability table in game memory. The CPU  selects a particular square in a manner which is consistent with the occurrence probability table. Generally, the occurrence probability table might cause certain squares to be landed on more frequently than other squares. In Table D-2, the \u201cOcc\u201d column identifies a predefined number of outcomes or \u201coccurrences\u201d of each square of the MONOPOLY ROLL & WIN game board, and the \u201cProb\u201d column identifies the probability of selecting or \u201clanding\u201d on the respective squares. An inspection of Table D-2 reveals that there is only 1 outcome, out of 12,802 possible outcomes, which will result in the player landing on the IN JAIL square. Similarly, there is only 1 outcome, out of 12,802 possible outcomes, which will result in the player landing on the GO TO JAR, square. Thus, the probability of the player landing on IN JAIL or GO TO JAIL (and thereby getting no award) is very small, 7.811\u00d710(i.e., 1\u00f712,802). The probability of landing on the other squares is generally much greater and also corresponds to the predefined number of outcomes or \u201coccurrences\u201d associated with the squares. For example, consider the \u201cGO\u201d square. The \u201cOcc\u201d column of Table D-1 indicates that there are 480 outcomes, out of 12,802 possible outcomes, which will result in the player landing on the GO square. Thus, the probability of the player landing on the GO square (and thereby getting an award of 200 coins or credits) is 0.037494 (i.e., 480\u00f712,802). The probability of landing on other squares is computed from the \u201cOcc\u201d column in similar fashion.","Similarly, in one embodiment, the likelihood of selecting certain CHANCE or COMMUNITY CHEST cards is predefined and stored in an occurrence probability table in game memory. The CPU  selects a particular CHANCE or COMMUNITY CHEST card in a manner which is consistent with the occurrence probability table. Generally, the occurrence probability table might cause certain cards to be \u201cdrawn\u201d more frequently than other cards. In Tables D-3 and D-4, respectively, the \u201cOcc\u201d column identifies a predefined number of outcomes or \u201coccurrences\u201d which might occur as a result of landing on CHANCE and COMMUNITY CHEST on the MONOPOLY ROLL & WIN game board. The \u201cProb\u201d column identifies the probability of selecting or \u201cdrawing\u201d the respective CHANCE and COMMUNITY CHEST outcomes. The various probabilities of the CHANCE and COMMUNITY CHEST outcomes are computed by dividing the number of occurrences of the particular outcome by the total number of CHANCE or COMMUNITY CHEST outcomes, as appropriate. For example, consider the \u201cADVANCE TO GO\u201d outcome in COMMUNITY CHEST. Table D-3 shows that there are 4 outcomes, out of 100 possible COMMUNITY CHEST outcomes, which will result in drawing the \u201cADVANCE TO GO\u201d card. Thus, having landed on the COMMUNITY CHEST square, the probability of the player drawing the \u201cADVANCE TO GO\u201d card (and thereby getting an award of 200 coins or credits) is 0.04 (i.e., 4\u00f7100). Next consider the \u201cADVANCE TO GO\u201d outcome in CHANCE. Table D-4 shows that there are 12 outcomes, out of 300 possible CHANCE outcomes, which will result in drawing the \u201cADVANCE TO GO\u201d card. Thus, having landed on the CHANCE square, the probability of the player drawing the \u201cADVANCE TO GO\u201d card (and thereby getting an award of 200 coins or credits) is 0.04 (i.e., 12\u00f7300). The probability of drawing other cards is computed in similar fashion.","The \u201cEV\u201d column identifies the expected values associated with the various squares (Table D-2), COMMUNITY CHEST cards (Table D-3) or CHANCE cards (Table D-4). These values are computed for each outcome by taking the product of the pay value (or average pay value) associated with that outcome and the probability associated with that outcome. Thus, for example, the \u201cGO\u201d square has an expected value of 7.49882831 (i.e., 200\u00d70.037494142), and the \u201cADVANCE TO GO\u201d card (in both CHANCE and COMMUNITY CHEST) has an expected value of 8 (i.e., 200\u00d70.04).","The \u201cPulls\/Hit\u201d value represents the number of times, on average, that the game must be played before landing on the particular square (Table D-2) or drawing the particular CHANCE or COMMUNITY CHEST cards (Tables D-3 and D-4). The \u201cPulls\/Hit\u201d column is simply the inverse of the \u201cProb\u201d values in Tables D-2, D-2 and D-4. Thus, for example, the \u201cGO\u201d square has a \u201cPulls\/Hit\u201d value of 26.67 (i.e., 1\u00f70.037494142), and the \u201cADVANCE TO GO\u201d card (in both CHANCE and COMMUNITY CHEST) has a \u201cPulls\/Hit\u201d value of 25 (i.e.,

various symbol combinations, probabilities and expected values associated with the ROLL & WIN game according to one embodiment of the present invention. The combinations include various standard winning combinations including \u201c777,\u201d \u201c3B3B3B,\u201d \u201c2B2B2B,\u201d \u201c1B1B1B,\u201d \u201cABABAB,\u201d \u201c2 Cherry\u201d and \u201cCherry;\u201d various combinations which will start the ROLL & WIN bonus game including \u201cUncleUncleUncle;\u201d and various combinations which will trigger the ROLL THE DICE multiplier feature, including \u201c7Roll7,\u201d \u201c3BRoll3B,\u201d \u201c2BRoll2B,\u201d \u201c1BRoll1B,\u201d \u201cABRollAB\u201d and \u201cAnyRollCherry\u201d and \u201cUncleRollUncle.\u201d In Table D-5 and the description to follow, \u201cRoll\u201d is a shorthand notation for the WILD DICE symbol, \u201c3B,\u201d \u201c2B,\u201d \u201c1 B\u201d and \u201cAB\u201d are shorthand notations for the 3 BAR, 2 BAR, 1 BAR and ANY BAR symbols and \u201cUncle\u201d is a shorthand notation for the RICH UNCLE PENNYBAGS symbol.","The \u201cPay\u201d column identifies payoff amounts associated with the respective combinations in Table D-5, for 1 coin played. In the case of the standard winning combinations, the payoff amounts are predetermined amounts stored in system memory. For example, the \u201c777\u201d combination is a standard winning combination which will award 50 coins or credits in a 1-coin game. In one embodiment, the coin awards are multiplied by two for two coins bet and multiplied by three for three or four coins bet. The fourth coin allows the player the opportunity to play the MONOPOLY ROLL & WIN\u2122 bonus game and does not increase the value of the standard winning combinations above the 3-coin payoff amount. Thus, for example, the \u201c777\u201d combination which, as noted above, will award 50 coins or credits in a 1-coin game, will award 100 coins or credits in a 2-coin game and 150 coins or credits in a 3- or 4-coin game.","In the case of the combinations starting the ROLL & WIN bonus game, the payoff amounts represent average payoff amounts which may be expected in the bonus game. For example, the \u201cUncleUncleUncle\u201d combination will start the ROLL & WIN bonus game (if 4 coins or credits are played) which will pay, on average, 81.08796 coins or credits.","In the case of the combinations including a \u201cRoll\u201d (WILD DICE) symbol, the payoff amounts represent the product of the standard payoff (or average bonus payoff) with various multiplier values 2 to 12 which might result from the ROLL THE DICE multiplier-bonus. For example, \u201c2 7Roll7\u201d is a shorthand notation for the 7, WILD DICE, 7 combination which triggers the ROLL THE DICE feature, and in which a multiplier bonus of \u201c2\u201d is selected in the ROLL THE DICE feature. The payoff amount for the \u201c2 7Roll7\u201d combination is 100, or twice the payoff of the \u201c777\u201d combination. Similary, \u201c3 7Roll7\u201d is a shorthand notation for the 7, WILD DICE, 7 combination in which a multiplier bonus of \u201c3\u201d is selected in the ROLL THE DICE feature to triple the payoff of the \u201c777\u201d combination, and so forth.","With the exception of the \u201cUncleRollUncle\u201d combination, which is only available for 4 coins played, the various combinations including a \u201cRoll\u201d (WILD DICE) symbol are multiplied by two for two coins bet and multiplied by three for three or four coins bet. The fourth coin allows the player the opportunity to play the MONOPOLY ROLL & WIN\u2122 bonus game and does not increase the value of the standard winning combinations above the 3-coin payoff amount. Thus, for example, the \u201c2 7Roll7\u201d combination which, as noted above, will award 100 coins or credits in a 1-coin game, will award 200 coins or credits in a 2-coin game and 300 coins or credits in a 3- or 4-coin game.","The \u201cProb\u201d column identifies, for the standard winning combinations, the probabilities of hitting the outcomes in a single spin. For the combinations including a WILD DICE (\u201cRoll\u201d) symbol, the \u201cProb\u201d value takes into account the probability of rolling the indicated multiplier as well as the probability of \u201chitting\u201d the indicated outcome. Where the reels each have twenty-two reel stop positions, as in the ROLL & WIN\u2122 game, there are 10,648 (22\u00d722\u00d722) possible symbol combinations. The probability of hitting any particular combination in a single spin is determined by dividing the number of possible \u201chits\u201d associated with that combination (which is a function of the number of reel positions of the symbols supporting that combination) by the total number of possible combinations (i.e., 10,648). For example, consider the \u201c777\u201d combination. Because there is one SEVEN symbol on reel , one SEVEN symbol on reel  and one SEVEN symbol on reel , there is one \u201chit\u201d associated with that combination. The probability of hitting that combination is therefore 9.39\u00d710(i.e. 1\u00f710,648).","Next consider the various \u201c7Roll7\u201d combinations. If the ROLL THE DICE multiplier is determined according to the roll of a pair of fair dice, the probability of selecting a \u201c2\u00d7\u201d or \u201c12\u00d7\u201d multiplier is 2.7%, the probability of selecting a \u201c3\u00d7\u201d or \u201c11\u00d7\u201d multiplier is 5.5%, the probability of selecting a \u201c4\u00d7\u201d or \u201c10\u00d7\u201d multiplier is 8.3%, the probability of selecting a \u201c5\u00d7\u201d or \u201c9\u00d7\u201d multiplier is 11.1%, the probability of selecting a \u201c6\u00d7\u201d or \u201c8\u00d7\u201d multiplier is 13.9% and the probability of selecting a \u201c7\u00d7\u201d multiplier is 16.7%. The probability of \u201chitting\u201d the \u201c2 7Roll7\u201d and \u201c12 7Roll7\u201d combinations is therefore 2.53\u00d710(i.e. 9.39\u00d710\u00d70.027). The remaining probabilities are computed in similar fashion.","The \u201cEV\u201d column identifies the normalized expected values of the various standard winning outcomes of Table D-2 for a 1-coin, 2-coin or 3-coin game. These values are computed for each outcome by taking the product of the pay value (or average pay value) associated with that outcome and the probability associated with that outcome, divided by the number of coins played. Thus, for example, the \u201c12 7Roll7\u201d outcome has a 1-coin expected value of 0.0015652 (600\u00d72.6087\u00d710\u00f71), a 2-coin expected value of 0.0015652 (1200\u00d72.6087\u00d710\u00f72) and a 3-coin expected value of 0.0015652 (1800\u00d72.6087\u00d710\u00f73).","The \u201c4thCoin\u201d column identifies the normalized expected values of the various standard winning outcomes of Table D-2 for a 4-coin game. These values are computed in similar fashion as the 1-coin, 2-coin and 3-coin expected values but differ because the pay value of the standard combinations does not increase from a 3-coin to a 4-coin game. Thus, for example, the \u201c12 7Roll7\u201d outcome has a 4-coin expected value of 0.00117393 (1800\u00d72.6087\u00d710\u00f74).","Any of the gaming machines heretofore described can be implemented with bonus-resource outcomes, causing the processor to generate a deferred instruction which is exercisable to enhance the excitement and\/or winning expectation in the bonus game. Generally, the deferred instruction associated with the bonus resource is exercisable in response to later outcomes or events in the game. For example, the bonus resource might might be obtained in response to special symbol combination(s) the basic game and the deferred instruction associated with the bonus resource might be exercised in the bonus game. The deferred instruction might be executed automatically by the CPU in response to certain later-displayed indicia in the game or might be exercisable in response to player input. In one embodiment, the CPU continues to operate in the basic mode after the occurrence of a bonus-resource outcome in the basic game. In this embodiment, any number of bonus-resource outcomes may occur through several repetitions of the basic game (causing the CPU to store a corresponding number of deferred instructions in game memory) before entering the bonus mode. In one embodiment, the CPU exercises the deferred instruction(s) associated with the bonus-resource(s), if at all, in the bonus game.","In one embodiment, the bonus game resource comprises a multiplier (e.g., 2\u00d7, 5\u00d7, 10\u00d7,etc.) associated with a deferred instruction to multiply a later displayed value, such as an amount of coin(s) or credit(s) otherwise awarded in a bonus game. For example, a \u201c5\u00d7\u201d resource, obtained as a result of a particular outcome of the basic game, might be exercised in the bonus game to instruct the CPU to multiply an otherwise-indicated award of 5 coins by five, resulting in an award of 25 coins. In another embodiment, the deferred instruction associated with the bonus game resource comprises an \u201coverride\u201d command causing the CPU to override or block the performance of an instruction otherwise indicated in the bonus game. For example, a deferred \u201coverride\u201d command, obtained in the basic game as a result of a particular bonus-resource outcome, might be played in the bonus game to override an \u201cend-bonus\u201d instruction encountered in the bonus game. Whereas the \u201cend-bonus\u201d instruction would otherwise have caused the CPU to end the bonus game, the exercise of the \u201coverride\u201d command would allow the player to continue the bonus game. With particular reference to the MONOPOLY-theme games described herein, one bonus-resource might comprise a \u201cGET OUT OF JAIL FREE\u201d card, obtainable as a result of a special symbol combination in the basic game and associated with a deferred instruction to \u201cget out of jail,\u201d or in other words to override the instruction nominally associated with the IN JAIL square. Thus, for example, if the IN JAIL square is nominally associated with an \u201cend-bonus\u201d instruction, causing the CPU to end the bonus game, a player landing on the IN JAIL square might exercise a \u201cGET OUT OF JAIL FREE\u201d card to override the nominal end-bonus instruction and continue the bonus game.","It will be appreciated that the present invention has generally been described with reference to the particular games ADVANCE TO BOARDWALK\u2122, REEL ESTATE\u2122, ONCE AROUND\u2122 and ROLL & WIN\u2122, based on the MONOPOLY\u2122 board game but is not limited to these particular games. For example, while the aforementioned games have a basic game in the form of a slot machine, the present invention may be implemented with virtually any type of game of chance or skill or combination of such games having outcomes (e.g., \u201cstart-bonus\u201d outcomes) which may trigger play of a bonus game. The basic game may comprise, for example, a video poker or video blackjack game. Moreover, the present invention may be based on board games other than MONOPOLY. Other variations within the scope of the present invention include basic games or bonus games with different numbers and types of reels and\/or symbols, different payline configurations, different values of coin awards, different probabilities, payback percentages, etc.","While the present invention has been described with reference to one or more particular embodiments, those skilled in the art will recognize that many changes may be made thereto without departing from the spirit and scope of the present invention.
