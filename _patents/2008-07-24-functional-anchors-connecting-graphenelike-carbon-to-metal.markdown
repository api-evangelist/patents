CCF-0524490 & CTS-0548774 awarded by the National Science Foundation.","The present disclosure relates to organic linkers. In particular, it relates to a functional linker linking a graphene-like carbon and or a graphene sheet, with a conducting material. More in particular, in some embodiments, it relates to a structure comprising a carbon nanotube or a graphene sheet, a metal, and an organic linker linking the carbon nanotube with the metal.","Carbon nanotubes, graphene sheets such as single graphene sheets (SGS), and arrays of these materials (hereafter referred to collectively as graphene-like carbon or GLC) have enormous opportunities for novel electric, mechanical and chemical properties [See references 1-5]. Numerous breakthroughs have been demonstrated successfully and have led to practical fabrication of carbon nanotube electronics devices, such as transistors, interconnects, spintronics, and sensors [See references 6-8].","GLCs are also promising candidate materials for lowest level on-chip interconnect conducting material of future integrated circuits, because they address such issues as signal propagation delay and process integration density and scaling, which are currently limited by Cu and Al metal wires.","However, a fundamental problem with these systems is the nature of the attachment to supports and conducting material. Major issues are mechanical stability, integrity of the electrical contact, and contact resistance between the conducting material that constitutes the support or the electrode (ES) and the GLC, hereafter denoted the ES-GLC interface.","The difficulty in achieving the desired mechanical and electrical properties arises from the nature of the bonding in GLC, which is characterized by spor planar carbons with strong delocalization or resonance in the out of plane pi orbitals. As a result the atoms in these planes interact only weakly with a support or electrode onto which they are attached. This leads to low binding energies (sometimes called van der Waals or Noncovalent bonding) and consequently weak mechanical strength. Concomitantly there is little delocalization of the active electrons the GLC with the ES, leading to a high contact resistance (low current for a given voltage across the interface) and capacitance (due to accumulation of charge as the voltage is ramped with time).","Quantum mechanics (QM) methods (Green's function [see references 16-21] with density functional theory, DFT) have been used to evaluate these mechanical and electrical properties from first principles. It has been shown that the most popular choices for electrodes (Cu, Au, and Pt) in the current settings lead to very poor mechanical and electrical properties. Of the more noble metals (less susceptible to oxidation), Pd has been shown to be the best in the current settings. It has also been shown that electropositive metals, such as Ti (the same would be true for Sc\u2014Ni, Y\u2014Ru, La\u2014Os, Ac-Lw), make good mechanical and electrical contacts in the current settings but may lead to practical problems, since in the current settings they react with the carbon from the GLC and shows a diminished mechanical and electrical contact in presence of oxygen.","The above problems are also present in fuel cell technology. With reference to fuel cell electrodes, transport of protons, electrons, and molecules are all determining factors in high performance fuel cell electrodes [see reference 24] One strategy for enhancing mass and electron transport is to use a nanostructured fuel cell electrode consisting of carbon nanotubes (CNT) loaded with Pt nanoparticles (Pt NPs) [see references 25-28]. The same problems identified above apply to fuel cells manufactured according to this strategy and used the settings currently known.","A further issue relates to the ES material used. Cu is currently the leading on-chip interconnect for integrated circuits, with fabrication processes established in the 1990's that have been well studied and improved since then. [see references 46-49] Advantages of Cu that have led to its extensive use in electronics is that it has the second highest electrical conductivity of pure metals and is abundant and inexpensive. Thus, it would be most desirable to connect Cu electrodes directly to the GLCs. However, it has been previously shown that the Cu-CNT interface in the current settings leads to extremely high contact resistance (11.7 M\u03a9), 672 times worse than Ti (17.4 k\u03a9) and 74 times worse than Pd-CNT interface (159 k\u03a9). [see reference 50] In addition, in the current settings Cu is mechanically weak. [see reference 50] As a result, metal contacts to CNT electrodes have preferred Pd, with little use of Cu.","Structures, methods and systems are herein disclosed that allow an attachment between a GLC and a conducting material that ensures mechanical stability, integrity of the electrical contact, thermal contact and\/or a minimized contact resistance and capacitance between the conducting material and the GLC.

Devices are generally intended to be in mutual electromechanical contact, usually by being soldered to a printed circuit board (PCB), to create an electronic circuit with a particular function (for example an amplifier, radio receiver, or oscillator). Devices may be packaged singly or in more or less complex groups as integrated circuits.","A dielectric material can be formed by a nonconducting substance, i.e. an insulator.

In some embodiments, the fuel cell further comprises manifolds which deliver fuel and oxidant to the anode and cathode respectively. In some embodiments, the anode, electrolyte membrane, and cathode form a membrane electrode assembly with a thickness of no more than about 300 \u03bcm.

The experimental setup and materials used for the following examples are described in Section S2 of Annex A, which forms part of the present disclosure and is incorporated by reference in its entirety.","To study the interface structures and anchor energies, Applicants used, in the embodiment here described, a three-layer 2\u00d72 Pt 111 slab to represent the Pt surface and a single graphene sheet to represent the carbon nanotube surface. These two surfaces were connected using various molecular anchors, with one anchor per cell. Applicants then optimized the structures for the Pt-slab-anchor-graphene system while fixing the two bottom layers of Pt atoms.","What is desired is that both the graphene-anchor bond and the anchor-Pt bond are strong for a good anchor of the Pt particle to the CNT surface.","Applicants used first principle simulations (i.e. simulations starting directly at the level of established laws of physics and does not make assumptions such as model and fitting parameters) to predict","(1) the structure of the CNT-anchor-metal interface,","(2) interaction energies between anchor and CNT and between anchor and metal, and","(3) the contact resistance between the CNT and metal for various anchors.","The following functional groups were considered by Applicants, \u2014SH, \u2014OH, \u2014NH, \u2014COOH, \u2014CONH, \u2014SOH. Such functional groups are expected to lose hydrogen atoms as they attach to the metal surface, making a strong covalent bond that should provide good electrical contact (small contact resistance) between the CNT and metal while also providing a good mechanical connection (preventing thermal diffusion of the carbon nanotubes).","Applicants' results are shown in the exemplary table of  and in .","The sequence for anchor energies is\n\n","According to the results illustrated in , the N anchor has the closest distance and also the strongest anchor energy. The S anchor shows that the bond between S\u2014Pt is strong enough to grab the sulfur atoms from the carbon surface. The chemical bond between S and carbon is broken. The conjugated anchors such as \u2014COO\u2014 and \u2014CON\u2014 have very good anchor energies.","To determine the contact resistance of  for various anchors, Applicants formed the sandwich slab structure shown in  (a simulation model that comprises 2 metal electrodes, 2 organic anchor layers and 2 graphene layers) and calculated the current\/voltage performance (resistance) by combining Green function's theory [16-21] with a DFT Hamiltonian. This leads to the function shown in , where T(E,V) is the transmission function of the anchor.","The sequence for the contact resistance near zero bias is:\n\n","A graph of bias voltage v. contact resistance for the above anchors is shown in . Without anchor there is a large contact resistance because of the lack of chemical bond between the CNT and the metal contact. All cases with chemical bonds enhance the contact conductivity dramatically. Moreover, the \u03c0 conjugation anchors such as \u2014CON\u2014, and \u2014COO\u2014 lead to the lowest contact resistance. This is because the delocalized frontier molecular orbitals of \u03c0 conjugated anchors provide better coupling to the conduction orbitals of the electrodes [19]. Moreover, the bond energetics of C-anchors and Pt-anchors also contribute to the contact conductivity as long as they have same binding characteristic. Involving both \u03c3 and \u03c0 binding characteristics, stronger anchors such as \u2014CON\u2014 including both sigma and \u03c0 binding would provide higher conductivity than weaker anchors such as \u2014COO\u2014.","Therefore, it appears that the \u2014COO\u2014 and \u2014CON\u2014 anchors are the best functional anchors to link carbon nanotubes and Pt metal contact. This strategy with these anchors should be useful for both single wall and multi wall nanotubes and also for similar graphene and graphite applications.","Applicants demonstrated use of the functional molecular anchors for nanostructured fuel cell electrocatalysts, according to the experimental approach set forth below.","Since the ohmic contact is one of the major reasons to lose fuel cell efficiency [see reference 29], Applicants suspected that part of the problem might be the contact resistance between the CNT and the metal catalysts particles, which can be as high as 500 K\u03a9 without post treatment [see reference 30]. In addition, Applicants were concerned that the Pt nanoparticles might not be sufficiently anchored to the CNT surface, allowing them to diffuse and eventually aggregate into large Pt NPs, which would have much reduced surface area [see reference 31].","To alleviate such potential problems, functional molecular anchors can be used to connect Pt nanoparticles (NPs) to multi-walled carbon nanotubes (MWCNTs) both mechanically and electrically. Anchors based on such functional groups as \u2014SH, \u2014OH, \u2014NH, \u2014COOH, \u2014SOH, \u2014CONHwere considered, all of which can be attached to MWCNT surfaces. As already mentioned above, these functional groups are expected to lose hydrogen atoms as they attach to the metal surface, making a strong covalent bond that should provide good electrical contact (small contact resistance) between the CNT and metal particle while also providing a good mechanical connection (preventing aggregation of the nanoparticles).","Therefore, Applicants carried out experiments by synthesizing electrocatalysts in which metal nanoparticles were attached to various anchors bonded to MWCNT and tested the electrocatalytic activity using a rotating disk configuration. Four MWCNTs samples with various anchors labeled as:","1. MWCNT-SH (1.0 wt % functional groups including 90% SH and 10% \u2014SOH),","2. MWCNT-NH(0.6 wt % functional groups including 50% \u2014NHand 50% \u2014CONH),","3. MWCNT-purified (3.5 wt % mixed \u2014COOH and \u2014OH), and","4. MWCNT-COOH (4.5 wt % mixed \u2014COOH and \u2014OH),","ordered from Nanocyl, were loaded with Pt NPs by the ethylene glycol method [see reference 35].",{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0142","num":"0143"},"figref":["FIG. 10","FIG. 10"],"sub":"2"},"To further characterize the relative Pt dispersion for various anchors, Applicants used cyclic voltammetry (CV) experiments to determine the active surface areas of Pt supported on these MWCNTs samples, as shown in . Using the calculated areas under the desorption peaks of hydrogen (from 0.05 to 0.37 V vs. NHE) and correcting for double layering charging effects Applicants have found that Pt\/MWCNT-NHwith \u2014NHand \u2014CON\u2014 groups have the largest electrochemical surface area (72 m\/g), followed by Pt\/MWCNT-COOH with 67 m\/g, Pt\/MWCNT-purified with 65 m\/g, and 56 m\/g for Pt\/MWCNT-SH. These results are in agreement with the observations of dispersion of Pt NP on anchored MWNTs.","The specific catalytic activity of the samples for the oxygen reduction reaction (ORR) was examined by potentiodynamic measurements at 5 mV\/s using the same electrochemical setup with Osaturating the electrolyte. To compare these systems the curves (see ) were normalized by the electrochemical surface area of Pt, obtained from the CV ().",{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0145","num":"0146"},"figref":"FIG. 12"},"Pt\/MWCNT-SH<Pt\/MWCNT-purified<Pt\/MWCNT-COOH<Pt\/MWCNT-NH,","indicating that the catalytic activity of ORR increases in the same order. Such differences are clearly identified by the half wave potential measurement (0.636V<0.675V<0.688V<0.711V), showing the same trend as the differences in dispersion from CV (). Since the surface areas of all samples have been normalized, the difference ORR curve is expected to contribute from the intrinsic contact resistances between metal and nanoparticles.","Based on the experimental and simulation results similar to the ones conducted in the previous example, Applicants demonstrated that the electric-catalysts system of MWCNT-CON\u2014Pt has the best performance among MWCNT-anchor-Pt which anchors can be \u2014CON\u2014, \u2014N\u2014, \u2014COO\u2014, \u2014O\u2014, \u2014SO\u2014 and \u2014S\u2014. Especially, current MWCNT-anchor-Pt sample with 1 wt % mixture \u2014CON\u2014 and \u2014N\u2014 anchors is already 33% better than MWCNT-anchor-Pt with 4.5 wt %\u2014COO-anchors considering the cyclic voltammetry curve in . One can expect that 4.5 wt % pure \u2014CON\u2014 anchored MWNTs would be four times better than current samples. These findings may provide the direction to further improve the catalytic activity.","The enclosed Annex A, which makes part of the description of the present application, shows some additional information with particular reference on the fuel cell embodiment of the present application. Section S1 of Annex A describes the computation and theoretical methodologies. Section S2 describes the experimental procedures. Section S3 describes detailed computation results.","In the background section of the present application, a problem with metal contacts made of Cu has been addressed. The present disclosure provides embodiments where such problem can be solved by incorporation of the functional linkers or \u201canchors\u201d similar to those shown in the previous embodiments. The anchors can bond covalently to the Cu, decreasing the contact resistance, while increasing the mechanical stability. The following embodiments further illustrate synthetic strategies that might be useful for incorporating the Cu-anchor-GLC elements into nanoelectronics.","In the next three paragraphs the modeling details of these additional embodiments will be initially discussed.","A Cu-anchor-graphene configuration is schematically shown in . ) shows a schematic perspective view of the configuration, while ) shows a simplified model of the concept.","The total resistance of a CNT (R), is often expressed as R=R+R+scattering, where Rrepresents resistance of CNT. [see reference 61] For the simple model of , R=R+R, where Ris the contact resistance of two layers of graphene with a fixed distance of 3.4 \u212b and Ris the contact resistance used by Applicants for each of the different anchors of these embodiments. The scattering term can be ignored since the distance is much smaller than the mean free path of an electron. Additionally, Applicants have found that metal-graphene models accurately represent metal-CNT models for all geometric considerations except for the distance between the CNT and electrodes which is slightly smaller (1.9-2.8%) than the graphene case, indicating that the larger attractive interaction is due to the incursion of the s hybrid character in the pit orbital caused by the curvature of the CNT.","The model geometries were optimized using the following steps: (1) Cu-anchor models were optimized to find the most stable binding sites and molecule species of the anchor molecules on a Cu(111) surface. For acetylene, carboxyl, and amide anchors, the CHgroup was attached at the end of the anchor molecules to replace the carbon on the graphene in the following step (3). (2) Graphene-anchor models, including the effects of the resonance positions, were fully optimized. (3) Cu(111)-anchor-graphene models for the current-voltage (I-V) calculations were fully optimized.","Applicants chose an exemplary 4\u00d74 unit cell (32 carbons per layer) of a graphene sheet (fixed at 0.98\u00d70.85 nm) to have large enough spacing to avoid interactions between anchor molecules. The QM optimized Cu(111) layers with ABC stacking (FCC) deposited on top of a graphene sheet, were used to represent Cu metal layers so that the periodic spacing of Cu metal matched with the graphite surface. The Cu\u2014Cu distances of the deposited Cu layers is within 5% of the nearest neighbor distance of the bulk crystal structure. For all optimizations, three layers of Cu were used with the second and third layers being held fixed.","The choice of anchors for these embodiments will now be described. In particular, Applicants chose simple functional groups, such as aryl (\u2014CH\u2014), acetylene (\u2014CC\u2014), amide (\u2014CONH\u2014) and carboxyl (\u2014COO\u2014), as anchor candidates to bind between Cu surfaces and CNTs. All anchor candidates have been reported to functionalize CNT side-walls in experiments. [see references 62-65] A variety of aryl functionalized CNTs can be synthesized by using aryldiazonium salts and the estimated degree is one out of approximately 20 carbons [see reference 63] or even up to 9 carbons [see reference 64], which can lead to a increase in solubility in organic solvents. The alkylated CNTs are synthesized using lithium and alkyl halides in liquid ammonia, which are soluble in common organic solvents. [see reference 65] The carboxyl groups can be introduced on the CNTs by sonicating in 3:1 sulfuric\/nitric acid solvents for three hours at 40 degrees C. and further treatment by ethylenediamine and the coupling agent produces the amido functionalized CNTs. [see reference 64]","With reference to the computational aspect of these embodiments, Applicants used SEQQUEST [see reference 66], a fully self-consistent Gaussian-based linear combination of atomic orbitals (LCAO) density functional theory (DFT) method with double-\u03b6 plus polarization (DZP) basis sets. [see reference 67] All calculations were based on the Perdew-Burke-Ernzerhof (PBE) generalized gradient approximation (GGA) with PBE pseudo atomic potentials and spin polarization within 2D periodic boundary conditions. [see reference 68] The k-point sampling of 4\u00d74 in the Brillouin Zone and the real space grid interval of 53\u00d760 in the x-y plane, for a grid spacing of 0.30 per point, were carefully determined by energetic convergence.","To obtain I-V characteristics of each model, the density of state (DOS) was obtained from DFT quantum mechanics, while the transmission coefficient was obtained using nonequilibrium Green's function theory with DFT. [see reference 69] The transmission function was then used in the Landauer-Buttiker formula to calculate the I-V characteristics. The total resistance of these systems was then obtained from the zero-bias transmission.","For the modeling of the Cu-benzene anchor, Applicants optimized the geometries of benzene (CH) on top of Cu atom (atop), face-centered cubic (fcc), hexagonal close-packed (hcp) and bridge site to find the most stable binding site on the Cu(111) surface, as shown in . When bonding the benzene to the Cu(111) surface, one hydrogen atom is removed from benzene, forming a phenyl. Applicants calculated snap bond energies and difference in the energies (relative energies) in which the lowest energy is defined as 0 kcal\/mol, as shown in the table of . The most stable binding site on Cu(111) for CH\u2014 is found to be at the bridge site with a bond energy of 46.9 kcal\/mol, which is slightly more favorable than the hcp site by 0.4 kcal\/mol, the fcc site by 1.6 kcal\/mol, and the atop site by 1.7 kcal\/mol. The perpendicular separation between the Cu(111) surface and anchor is 1.81 \u212b at the bridge site, which is the smallest of all the anchors.","In a similar manner to the benzene modeling, the acetylene anchor with optimized geometries for propyne ((CH)CCH) on atop, fcc, hcp, and bridge sites were used to find the most stable binding site on Cu(111) by removing one hydrogen atom bonded to the acetylene, as shown in . The methyl, bounded at the end of the acetyl to replace the carbon on the graphene, is used to clarify the bond directions. Applicants again calculated snap bond energies and delta energies in which the highest energy is defined as 0 kcal\/mol, as shown in the table of . The most stable binding site on Cu(111) for propyne is found to be at the fcc site with a bond energy of 103.5 kcal\/mol, which is slightly more favorable than the hcp site by 0.7 kcal\/mol and is much more stable than the atop site by 14.7 kcal\/mol, indicating that the three-fold sites provide a preferable overlap of the orbitals between Cu on Cu(111) surface and carbon on propyne. The perpendicular separation between Cu(111) surface and the anchor is 1.37 \u212b at the fcc site, which is the smallest distance for all the anchors.","For the amide anchor, (CH)CONHon top of Cu(111) surface with and without hydrogen atoms were optimized to choose the most stable molecule which bonds to the Cu(111) surface, as shown in . The snap bond energies and delta energies were calculated, as shown in the table of . One hydrogen atom is placed on the Cu surface for the (CH)CONH model and two hydrogen atoms are placed on the Cu surface for the (CH)CON to enable comparison of the total energies of all the models. Applicants found that (CH)CONH bonds to the Cu(111) surface with the snap bond energy of 122.2 kcal\/mol, which is more energetically favorable than (CH)CONHand (CH)CONH. In the (CH)CONH model, the O atom is on the top of the Cu atom, the N atom is in the bridge position between two Cu atoms and the perpendicular separation between Cu(111) surface and anchor is 1.58 \u212b.","For the carboxyl anchor, (CH)COOH on top of Cu(111) surface with and without a hydrogen atom were optimized to choose the most stable molecule which bonds to the Cu(111) surface, as shown in . One hydrogen atom was added to the surface of Cu(111) for the (CH)COO model to compensate for the missing hydrogen atom and enable a comparison of the total energy with (CH)COOH by calculation of the snap bond energies and delta energies, as shown in the table of . Applicants found that the (CH)COOH molecule does not bond to the Cu(111) surface due to the stability of the molecule itself, which also confirms that the calculations are being carried out reasonably. On the contrary, (CH)COO bonded to the Cu(111) surface with a snap bond energy of 70.3 kcal\/mol, with one O atom on the top of the Cu atom and the other O atom in the bridge position between two Cu atoms, with a perpendicular separation between Cu(111) surface and anchor of 1.75 \u212b.","Previous theoretical studies reported that chemically bonding of an anchor to the side wall of a CNT creates a half-filled band near the Fermi energy because of an unpaired spin of a p\u03c0 orbital of a carbon-carbon bond. [see references 70-71] Since I-V characteristics at the interface are a critical issue and the unrealistic half-filled band near the Fermi energy can cause overestimation of the conductance, Applicants carefully studied the anchors with or without unpaired spin to determine which are energetically favorable on the unit cell of graphene sheet when including the resonance effects. To examine this issue, the energetic in adiabatic and snap bond energy between resonance and non-resonance positions were calculated by bonding two ethylene molecules (CH) on the graphene sheet and removing one hydrogen atom. The graphene unit cell consists of 32 carbon atoms with a fixed area of 0.98\u00d70.85 nm. When placing one ethylene on the graphene unit cell (shown in circle in the middle of )), there are nine resonance positions (a, b and c) and nine non-resonance positions (d, e, and f). Each alphabet notation represents the equivalent positions in the resonance or non-resonance positions. For example, when the second ethylene is bonded on a2 site as shown in ), which is equivalent to positions a1 and a3, the two ethylene molecules are in resonance positions. Second ethylene positions which are smaller than 2.8 \u212b from the first ethylene position are not considered in order to avoid the large steric interactions between molecules.","To summarize the computation results, the adiabatic and snap bond energies measured by adding one ethylene and two ethylene molecules are shown in the chart of  and the table of . According to , the adiabatic bond energy of the second addition of the ethylene molecule at resonance positions is larger than those of the first ethylene molecule by 13.0 kcal\/mol, but that of non-resonance positions is smaller than the first ethylene molecule by 4.4 kcal\/mol. Additionally, the adiabatic bond energy at the resonance positions is more stable by 17.4 kcal\/mol than those at the non-resonance positions on average. Applicants used the adiabatic bond energetic to exclude the significant effect of the strain energetic in the graphene sheet. It is clear that the addition of the second anchors in the resonance position stabilize the total anchor-graphene models. Thus, a hydrogen atom is added in the resonance position on a graphene unit cell for all anchor calculations to avoid creating an unrealistic half-filled band or a lowest unoccupied molecular orbital (LUMO) which affects the quantum mechanical current-voltage (I-V) calculations.","By taking into account the resonance effect which is described above, the graphene-anchor models were optimized by removing one hydrogen atom from each anchor and placing it on the resonance position (a3) of the graphene unit cell shown in . For all anchors, atop sites were found to be favorable. The snap bond energetic between the anchor and graphene, and the graphene strain energetic, which is due to the deformation of the graphene sheet by bonding both the anchor and H atom, are shown in the table of . The largest snap bond energy is for acetylene with 82.6 kcal\/mol, followed by benzene (58.9 kcal\/mol), carboxyl (50.5 kcal\/mol), and amid (42.0 kcal\/mol). The acetylene anchor showed a significantly smaller snap bond energy than the benzene and the graphene strain energy in the acetylene model is slightly larger than the other models. These results also support the strong interaction at the acetylene-graphene interface.","Optimization of Cu(111)-anchor-graphene models and construction of I-V models will now be discussed. In particular, Applicants fully optimized the geometries of the Cu(111)-anchor-graphene models obtained from the above paragraphs. The total snap bond energy is the largest for acetylene anchor (168.9 kcal\/mol) of all four anchors, followed by carboxyl (123.9 kcal\/mol), amide (117.8 kcal\/mol), and benzene (106.1 kcal\/mol), as shown in the table of . The perpendicular separations between Cu(111) surface and graphene is significantly larger for benzene (7.03 \u212b) due to its configuration, while the rest of the separations have similar values. Looking at the results in more detail, the benzene-Cu(111) surface is 1.97 \u212b, which is 0.64 \u212b larger than the acetylene-Cu surface separation, and the benzene-graphene separation of 1.58 \u212b is 0.10 \u212b larger than the acetylene-Cu surface separation. The amide-graphene separation (1.62 \u212b) is similar to the carboxyl-graphene separation (1.64 \u212b), although the amide-Cu surface separation (1.88 \u212b) is smaller than the carboxyl-Cu surface separation by 0.15 \u212b.","To enable a direct comparison of the contact resistance at the interface between each anchor model and graphene, the I-V models were constructed from the optimized geometries by reversing one of the models and placing it at the AB stacking positions of the original graphene sheet as shown in . The three Cu(111) layers represent the two electrodes (source and drain) of a CNT or SGS. The Cu contacts without anchor was calculated as discussed in [see reference 50], see ). The distance between the two graphene sheets was fixed at 3.4 \u212b, which is specified by the experimental data. [see reference 72].","The contact resistance of the Cu(111)-anchor-graphene models will now be discussed. For all anchor models, the DOS ()) of carbon are larger than the no anchor model, indicating improved conduction channels at the interface. The transmission coefficients near the Fermi energy ()) and the strength of the amide, carboxyl, acetylene, no anchor, and benzene models are listed in descending order. Benzene shows a very small transmission coefficient which indicates that there is no available orbital for current flow between the electrodes.","In turn, the I-V characteristics ()), the conductance ()) and total resistance per unit area ()) correlate directly with the transmission coefficient. Applicants calculated contact resistances of 43 k\u03a9 for carboxyl anchor, 58 k\u03a9 for amide anchor, 128 k\u03a9 for acetylene anchor, 10.3 M\u03a9 for benzene anchor, and 11.7 M\u03a9 for Cu without anchor after averaging for a bias voltage from \u22120.1 V to 0.1 V (see table of , where the bias voltage is defined as the difference between the source and the drain voltage. These values should be interpreted as a relative evaluation of these models.","The interaction energies of various anchors (table of ) indicate that all anchors are good candidates for enhancing the mechanical stabilities of the Cu-nanotube interface as compared to that of the Cu without anchor which has an interaction energy of 4.8 kcal\/mol with a separation of 3.30 \u212b. The acetylene anchor obtains the largest mechanical stability of all others because of the strong cohesive energy, that is also represented by the short separations to Cu(111) surface and graphene. The snap bond energy of benzene anchor is smaller than the acetylene anchor by 62.8 kcal\/mol and the separation between anchor-Cu(111) and anchor-graphene are larger by 1.48 times and 1.07 times respectively, which is possibly due to the steric interactions between the benzene and the surfaces. The snap bond energies of amide and carboxyl anchors are relatively smaller than that of the acetylene anchor since the anchor ions are stabilized by resonance effects. Applicants also found that the second anchor bonds to the resonance position on the SGS to gain stability, which is also true for CNT surface.","By applying the carboxyl anchor, the contact resistance can be reduced by approximately by a factor of 270 when compared to the Cu electrodes without anchors. The contact resistance of the Pd-graphene (no anchor) can be calculated as 159 k\u03a9. Thus, the carboxyl, amid and acetylene anchors can improve the contact resistance better then the Pd electrodes.","Interestingly, the contact resistance for the benzene anchor is essentially the same as without the anchor. This is because the benzene leads to a total tunneling distance of 7.03 \u212b which is approximately 50% larger than the other three cases. The experimentally reported anchors applied in self-aligning assemblies, such as sodiumdodecylsulphate (SDS) [see reference 52] and long-chained aryldiazonium salts [see reference 53] which possess long alkyl chains (Cand Crespectively) leading the large separations, are likely to dramatically increase the contact resistance.",{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0173","num":"0174"},"figref":["FIG. 31","FIG. 31(","FIG. 31(","FIG. 28","FIG. 31(","FIG. 31("],"i":["a","b","c","d"]},"In accordance with the embodiments above, using quantum mechanical methods shows that appropriate anchors can dramatically reduce the contact resistance of Cu-CNT and Cu-SGS interfaces, while increasing mechanical stability.

Introducing the carboxyl anchor at the Cu-SGS interface can improve the contact resistance by 3.7 times compared to the Pd-SGS interface without an anchor, making the Cu electrodes a good candidate for the CNT or SGS electronics.",{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0175","num":"0176"},"figref":"FIG. 31"},"The anchors should be selected to reduce contact resistance as demonstrated in the present writing in the detailed calculations for the above discussed four functional groups.

Problems include: assessing the actual magnitude of the contact area between the nanotube and the metal, the quality of the connection of macroscopic leads to the nanoscale contacts, additional contact resistance due to these contacts, stray electrical pathways in the nanoscale system that might carry part of the current, and contaminants at the interface between the metal electrode and the CNT. For these reason there have been very few attempts reported to measure the specific contact resistance (\u03a9\/atom) at the metal-nanotube or metal-graphene interfaces.","The only reliable experimental data for the magnitude of the specific contact resistance for metal-graphene or metal-nanotube interfaces of which Applicants are aware is the recent report by Kanbara et al. [reference 74] for the case of the Pt-CNT side-contacted interface. Reference 74 reported four-terminal experiments for a Pt electrode that was 5 nm thick and approximately 500 nm wide along the CNT, deposited on the side of the CNT and protected with 60 nm of Au. This \u201cside-contacted\u201d metallic SWNT was reported to have a diameter in the range of 1.0-1.5 nm. They found a contact resistance of R\u22485 k\u03a9 for a system with a length between contacts of approximately 1 \u03bcm (500 nm\u00d72 contacts). [reference 74] To analyze these experimental results to obtain the specific contact resistance, Applicants assume that the single-walled carbon nanotube (SWNT) was the (10,10) type most commonly produced for such experiments. This has a diameter of 1.37 nm. Given the length of the contact along the SWNT of 1 \u03bcm (1,000 nm) and assuming that 50% of the carbon atoms around the circumference of the SWNT are in contact with electrodes, Applicants estimate that the contact has N=40\/2.47 (periodic unit length, m)\u00d71,000 (nm)\u00d70.5 (50%)=8,097 carbon atoms in contact with the Pt. Thus Applicants estimate that the experimental specific contact resistance per carbon atom, is Rc=R\u00d7N=5,000\u00d78,096=40.5 M\u03a9.","This experimental value of 40.5 M\u03a9 can be compared with Applicants' previously reported calculations [reference 75] for Pt side contacted to graphene, which led to a specific contact resistance of Rc=35.7 M\u03a9 per carbon atom. Given all uncertainties in the experiment, this is excellent agreement. This validates that the QM theory can be used to predict accurate contact resistances, enabling in silico design of improve systems such as the functional anchors described here.","In particular, the examples set forth above are provided to give those of ordinary skill in the art a complete disclosure and description of how to make and use the embodiments of the structures, devices, systems and methods of the disclosure, and are not intended to limit the scope of what the inventors regard as their disclosure.

A periodic slab that includes three layers of platinum totalizing 12 atoms was used to describe Pt (111) surface. The unit cell c parameter was set to be 18 \u212b at z direction for keeping 50% of the unit cell as vacuum in order to avoid any interaction between slabs. The calculations were performed by using nonlocal density functional theory (DFT) with the generalized gradient approximation (GGA-II) and periodic boundary conditions. [Perdew, J. P. and Y. Wang, Phys. Rev. B 1992, 46, 6671.] We used the ultrasoft plane wave pseudopotentials generated with the optimization scheme of Lin et al. [Lin, J. S.; Qteish, A.; Payne, M. C.; and Heine, V. Phys.

NaOH (2.5 M in EG solution) was added to adjust the pH of the solution to above 13, and then the solution was heated at 140\u00b0 C. for 3 h to ensure that Pt was completely reduced; the entire EG solution has a DI water content of 5 vol %. Refluxing conditions were used to keep water in the synthesis system. The whole preparation process was also conducted under flowing argon.

Preparation of Rotating Disk Electrodes","The active layers of the as-prepared catalysts (Pt\/MWCNT-SH, Pt\/MWCNT-purified, Pt\/MWCNT-COOH and Pt\/MWCNT-NH) on the RDE were prepared using a method briefly explained here. A mixture containing 8 mg of Pt\/MWCNT powder and 2 ml of ethanol was ultrasonically blended in a glass vial for 2-3 hours. A volume of 10 \u03bcl of this ink was spread on the surface of a vitreous carbon RDE (0.196 cm) using a microsyringe and dried in an air oven at 80\u00b0 C. for about 10 min to obtain a thin active layer. After drying, to bind catalyst powders on RDE surface, about 10 \u03bcl of 0.1% Nafion solution was added by using the syringe to make sure that surface is flat. At last, DI water was added on the catalyst surface to check if air bubble occurs. We must make sure that no bubble will form on the surface. To confirm the reproducibility of the results, three electrodes were prepared and tested for each catalyst.","S2.3.2. Measurements in Liquid Electrolytes","RDEs were used to record cyclic voltammograms in oxygen or argon saturated liquid electrolytes. Argon saturated electrolytes were used to obtain the electrochemical active area of the Pt particles. The liquid electrolyte was HSO(0.5 M). A Ag\/AgCl was used as reference electrodes. The cyclic voltammograms obtained on the stationary RDEs in Ar saturated solutions at the san rate of 50 mV\/s. The polarization curves for oxygen reduction kinetics on the as-prepared catalysts obtained on the rotating (3000 rpm) RDE in oxygen saturated solutions at the scan rate of 5 mV\/s.","Section S3.
