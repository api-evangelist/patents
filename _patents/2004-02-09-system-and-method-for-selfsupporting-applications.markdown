{"@attributes":{"id":"description"},"RELAPP":[{},{}],"heading":["CROSS-REFERENCE TO RELATED APPLICATIONS","BACKGROUND","SUMMARY","DETAILED DESCRIPTION"],"p":["This application claims the benefit of U.S. Provisional Patent Application No. 60\/446,770, entitled SYSTEM AND METHOD FOR SELF-SUPPORTING APPLICATIONS filed on Feb. 11, 2003, which application is incorporated herein by reference in its entirety.","Traditionally, applications and help desks have been separate entities that have relied on human intervention to report failures and deliver support to the end user of the application. This process is costly, time-consuming, and inefficient. The system and method of the present application in one embodiment eliminates or reduces the human intervention in trouble shooting issues that are essentially problems in automation mechanisms.","The system and method in one embodiment use web services to embed the functionality of the service delivery systems (help desk, knowledge bases, diagnostic tools, etc.) into the applications that use them. The system and method in one embodiment provide a standard interface to the service delivery system so that supported applications and devices can interact with them in a similar fashion. Embedding the support functionality into the technical environment allows effective issue identification, notification, diagnostics and ultimately, resolution. The closer the service technology is to the actual problem the better chance it has to respond in a timely and appropriate manner.",{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0009","num":"0008"},"figref":"FIG. 1"},"The system and method of the present disclosure in one embodiment takes the next step in automating the issue resolution process by linking the applications themselves into the support mechanism for the enterprise. When a fault occurs, instead of throwing up an error message and halting or crashing, the applications or devices , ,  themselves are aware of the service system , , connects with it, and takes the appropriate action.","The system and method in one embodiment open up the business rules and workflow that previously involved only the help desk organization , and makes them available to other applications. This allows these business rules to act as the hub of an Enterprise Service Model that can be consulted by applications and hardware when support is needed. As a result, enterprise service policies are automated all the way to the end user.","Service consumers  such as applications ,  and hardware services  themselves by checking knowledge base services provided by service providers , for example, for instructions on how to handle an exception, check the service level of the user through other services and where necessary escalate to a service desk triggering an escalation.","Service consumers  may include any entity that may require a service. That entity may be an application, hardware device, the network, or an actual person. The service consumer may request a fix when something is broken. The service consumer may also request service related information, scheduled maintenance, diagnostics, service procedures, or anything defined by corporate policy as in the domain of the service organization. These may include business procedures in response to business events that are not necessarily technical issues.","Service providers  may be any entity that provides these services to the consumer. Service providers  may be people, applications, or devices that participate in the support infrastructure and have access to the corporate service and support policy.","The system of the present application may reside alongside the traditional service desk . At least a part of the functionality that used to reside inside the service desk application may be pulled out and made available via a \u201cdistributed service bus\u201d . This bus may provide functions such as a common access infrastructure for all service consumers  to request service; a container for all service providers , giving them a common vehicle to expose their available services, and an intermediary between the service providers  inside the bus and the service consumers  on the outside; housing for the service policy and business rules that govern the behavior of the system of the present application and that is accessed by both service providers and  consumers .","In one embodiment, the traditional service desk application  may be treated as another service consumer requesting services through the distributed service bus .- Further, devices , commercially available applications , and custom corporate applications  may be treated as service consumers  and may plug into the system of the present disclosure to provide support to their users.","In one embodiment, the system and method of the present application allows the service consumers  to service themselves. As an example, a service consumer  that encounters an exception can query the business policy, for example, a part of the distributed service bus , to determine what course of action to take under the current circumstances. It may need to determine information such as the user's service level agreement, if a knowledge base  contains pertinent information about the current condition, should a trouble ticket  be opened and with what associated information, or should an escalation  be initiated with the associated notifications. The service policy may also dictate that related procedures be initiated, for example, an automated software delivery update, or an automatic password reset. This may result in a fix to the original issue, which can then be automatically closed.","As another example, a common feature of hardware devices is their ability to contact the vendor to notify the service department of some service event or breakdown. In one aspect, this functionality may be extended to first contact a service policy supported by the distributed service bus  to find out what action or actions need to be taken.","The service policy according to various business rules may be able to respond to such questions as should this issue be addressed internally or is a vendor input required; who is the service vendor and what is the service level agreement in place; is there a warranty in place; is the hardware coming off lease shortly and does it pay to have it repaired; is there knowledge available in the knowledge base that can help diagnose or repair the current situation.","In another example, commercial applications  may plug into the system of the present disclosure and make those applications more supportable. For instance, when an error or any event requiring intervention is encountered, the applications  can consult with the system of the present application to determine the level of service required and react accordingly. For example, questions such as who is the user and what is their service level agreement; should a workflow be initiated to address the problem; is an escalation or a notification required; does the user need additional training; what does the business policy say regarding the priority of this issue versus others that currently need attending to; what is the cost versus benefit of fixing the problem are triggered and processed.","In one embodiment, multiple service providers , which may include multiple service vendors, may be involved in effecting a resolution. For instance, a system monitoring agent component, in one aspect of the present disclosure, receiving the message triggered from a service consumer  may indicate that an application  is having performance issues and may automatically open a service desk workflow  which will initiate an asset discovery. This, in turn, may indicate that a software delivery update needs to take place in order to resolve the problem. Throughout the process, the service policy may dictate the appropriate course of action, authorization, and priority.","Similarly, custom corporate applications may incorporate or embed in them the logic to for having access and knowledge of the system of the present disclosure. For example, a custom built line of business application can determine, using the system of the present disclosure, that a user that is repeatedly selecting the wrong application options or entering erroneous data may need training, and that individual can be automatically enrolled in the appropriate training course. In another example, the user may be determined as a senior executive, whose service level agreement may indicate an immediate escalation and call-back according to the service policy housed in the system of the present disclosure. In this case, the user may get a call a minute later from a service analyst providing proper instructions in using the business application.","In one embodiment, under the system of the present disclosure, a traditional service desk functionalities may be extended to include maintaining service policies such as determining, interpreting and encoding the service policies, automating service standards and methodologies, integrating partner applications and devices under the system of the present disclosure, and developing and adopting internal standards for the system of the present disclosure.","In its basic use, any application or device can become more supportable by linking directly to the service delivery systems. The technical infrastructure and people who use it are supported by the system of the present disclosure, which automates service procedures and deploys point solutions. The system of the present disclosure integrates the technical environment and the service tools under a common provider\/consumer model that is governed by a corporate service policy. A more supportable application or device will decrease downtime and user frustration, increasing productivity and user satisfaction.",{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0025","num":"0024"},"figref":"FIG. 2","b":["202","204","204","204","204","202","206","204","202"],"i":["a","b","c","d ","a","d","a","d "]},"In addition to bringing these components together to provide service, the system of the present application in one embodiment provides feedback to the corporate decision makers to facilitate a proactive position in the development and maintenance of service policy defined in the enterprise service business logic  via a business impact analysis . The business impact analysis  communicates with the enterprise service business to retrieve information related to all service events processed in the enterprise service business logic . Using the retrieved information, the business impact analysis  may fine-tune the current service policy used in the enterprise service business logic , for example, towards increasing positive business impacts and reducing negative impacts.",{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0027","num":"0026"},"figref":"FIG. 3","b":["306","316","308","316","306","304"]},{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0028","num":"0027"},"figref":"FIG. 4","b":"402"},"At , service policy is consulted for this particular consumer.
