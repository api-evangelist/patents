title: Customizing application page loading in a discovery interface
abstract: A system provides customized user interface data to a media application, such as a media discovery interface, or to any application for that matter, thereby extending the original application. Via a network connection, elements of the user interface can be downloaded to the application in a package of markup data and resources, including images, text, and links. A user interface framework of the media application processes the markup data from the downloaded package and utilizes packaged resources, local code components, and externally-obtained (e.g., Web resources) to render a customized application page for the media application. Based on a wide variety of computing system and user parameters, the offerings and application pages presented to the user can be filtered and/or reordered to be more appropriate for the computing system and user.

{"@attributes":{"id":"description"},"RELAPP":[{},{}],"heading":["CROSS-REFERENCE TO RELATED APPLICATIONS","BACKGROUND","SUMMARY","DETAILED DESCRIPTIONS"],"p":["The present application claims benefit of U.S. Provisional Patent Application No. 60\/846,789, entitled \u201cCustomizing Application Page Loading in a Discovery Interface\u201d and filed on Sep. 22, 2006, which is specifically incorporated by reference for all that it discloses and teaches.","The present application is related to U.S. patent application Ser. No. 11\/657,356, entitled \u201cCustomizing Applications in a Discovery Interface\u201d and filed on Jan. 24, 2007, and U.S. patent application Ser. No. 11\/657,244, entitled \u201cCustomizing a Menu in a Discovery Interface\u201d and filed on Jan. 24, 2007, which are both specifically incorporated by reference for all that they disclose and teach.","The convergence of computing and entertainment continues to provide new content and options for consumers. For example, cable subscribers can now access cable television programs and video-on-demand content (VOD) through their set-top boxes. In one offering, video-on-demand service allows a user to select a program for viewing from a library of programs, wherein all of the programs are available at any time and can be paused, saved, reviewed, etc. (as opposed to a cable television program that is only available at a scheduled time and duration). Other sources of content may also exist, including content from a media library, an Internet Protocol (IP) stream, a Web site, etc.","Consumers and content providers can find great benefit in the availability of content from so many different types of sources. For example, a consumer can view a rerun episode of a cable television program and then search for and view a subsequent episode of the same program over VOD or some other content providing channel. For their part, content providers can keep people \u201ctuned in\u201d with a wider assortment of content and content types.","In providing a user interface to access such a wide variety of content, certain media applications provide a discovery interface. In one existing example, a discovery interface takes the form of an Electronic Programming Guide (EPG). However, the available content, and more importantly, the offerings and the manner in which the offerings are made to the user may need to change over time. Existing EPGs fail to adequately accommodate changes to the user interface and functionality of application pages used to access the ever changing content and offerings.","Implementations described and claimed herein address the foregoing problems by providing customized user interface data for a media application, such as a media discovery interface, or to any application for that matter, thereby extending the original application. Via a network connection, elements of the user interface can be downloaded to the application in a package of markup data and resources, including images, text, and links. A user interface framework of the media application processes the markup data from the downloaded package and utilizes packaged resources, local code components, and externally-obtained (e.g., Web resources) to render a customized application page for the media application. Based on a wide variety of computing system and user parameters, the offerings and application pages presented to the user can be filtered to be more appropriate for the computing system and user.","In this manner, by leaving some or all of the responsibility for filtering to the user's computing device, the task of managing content at the server is greatly simplified. A single version of the package capable of serving all users can be created and maintained. Otherwise, a server would need the capacity to either (a) pre-generate and store many possible permutations of the package, representing various combinations of user parameters, or (b) dynamically generate a filtered package for each user, based on the user parameters, at the time it is requested for download.","In some implementations, articles of manufacture are provided as computer program products. One implementation of a computer program product provides a computer program storage medium readable by a computer system and encoding a computer program. Another implementation of a computer program product may be provided in a computer data signal embodied in a carrier wave by a computing system and encoding the computer program. Other implementations are also described and recited herein.","This Summary is provided to introduce a selection of concepts in a simplified form that are further described below in the Detailed Description. This Summary is not intended to identify key features or essential features of the claimed subject matter, nor is it intended to be used to limit the scope of the claimed subject matter.",{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0018","num":"0017"},"figref":"FIG. 1","b":["100","102","104","106","102","104","108","110","112","110","112","104"]},"In one implementation, the computing system  executes a media application that manages the user's access to media content, whether available locally or remotely. For example, the user can use his or her computing system  to control a portable media player , the tuner device , a local media library , and other content available from discrete devices or over a communications network . Examples of the control a user may apply can include without limitations transferring content between a portable media player  and a local media library , scheduling the recording of a cable television program by a digital video recorder (not shown) coupled to the computing system , downloading IP content (such as a video or song) from an IP content provider , etc.","In one implementation, the media application also provides the discovery interface  on a display device  (e.g., a monitor or television) coupled to the computing device . Discovery data is obtained through a media information service , which collects program information about content from a variety of sources. The media information service  maps data from a variety of sources to one or more consistent schema, enabling a consistent discovery experience, and associates the content from different sources to provide interrelationships among content elements. The discovery interface  can be represented by an on-screen guide, such as an electronic program guide (EPG), although various monikers may be used in other implementations, including without limitation interactive program guide (IPG) and electronic service guide (ESG). The discovery interface  presents an on-screen guide to the available content (e.g., broadcast content, such as scheduled cable television programs, and non-broadcast content, such as available IP content, locally stored media, etc.) in which broadcast content and non-broadcast content are shown together via virtual channels of the unified discovery interface.","In one implementation, the discovery interface  provides a graphical user interface that can display program titles and other descriptive information (collectively \u201cdiscovery data\u201d), such as a summary, actors' names and bios, directors' names and bios, year of production, etc. In one implementation, the information is displayed on a grid with the option to select more information on each program, although other formats are also contemplated. Channel identifiers pertaining to the scheduled cable programs, the program start and end times, genres, thumbnail images, and other descriptive metadata can also be presented within the discovery interface . Radio and song information may offer other information, such as artist, album, album cover graphics, and track title information. The discovery interface  allows the user to browse program summaries; search by genre, channel, etc.; and obtain immediate access to the selected content, reminders, and parental control functions. If the computing device  is so configured or so connected, a discovery interface  can also provide control for scheduled recording of programs.","A user can use the discovery interface  to navigate, select, and discover content by a variety of parameters, including time, title, channel, genre, cost, actors, directors, sources, relationships to other content, etc. Navigation can be accomplished through the media application by a variety of input devices, such as a remote control, a keyboard, and a mouse. In one implementation, for example, the user can navigate through the discovery interface  and display information about scheduled cable programs, video-on-demand programs, and associated IP content within a single presentation frame. By navigating through the discovery interface , the user can manipulate and obtain more information about a current program or about other programs available through the discovery interface . For example, when the computing device  is connected to a cable content provider , the user can plan his or her viewing schedule, learn about the actors of available programs, and record cable programs to a hard disk in the computer device  for later viewing.","In one implementation, a customized application package can be downloaded to the computing system  in order to customize the data and applications available to the user through the discovery interface . The customized application package is typically downloaded from the management interface service , but customized application packages may be available from the local (or remote) media library  or from various content providers, such as content providers , , and . A customized application package may include without limitation images, listings of available content, text, markup language files, internal and external links used to present a customizable discovery interface to a user, etc. In one implementation, one or more menus of the discovery interface  may be customized with new images, text, functionality, selections, endpoints, etc. In another implementation, individual application pages that are referenced from a menu or other selection may be customized.",{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0024","num":"0023"},"figref":"FIG. 2","b":["200","202","200","204","206","206"]},"In one implementation, the start menu is represented internally by a markup data file that specifies a user interface having a set of menu items and offering tiles. A user interface (UI) framework processes the start menu markup data and renders the start menu on the display accordingly. One or more of the offering tiles may be built into the media application executing on the computing system. For such built-in tiles, the start menu markup data merely has statically defined links to built-in application pages. One or more of the menu items and\/or offering tiles may also be customizable. For these menu items or offering tiles, a placeholder exists in the start menu markup data, such that if resources have been downloaded for a specific placeholder, the offering tile is rendered for that placeholder.",{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0026","num":"0025"},"figref":"FIG. 3","b":["300","302","300"]},{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0027","num":"0026"},"figref":"FIG. 4","b":["400","402","404","406","408","410","410","412","414"]},"An end user  can then interact with the media application executing on the client computing system to select offerings. For example, the end user  can select an offering tile from the start menu to access a built-in application page, a customized application page, or a Web application page. In some implementations, the end user  may employ a remote control, a keyboard, a mouse, a touch screen, etc. to interact with the media application.",{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0029","num":"0028"},"figref":"FIG. 5","b":["500","502","503","510","508"]},"Built-in application pages  represent application pages (such as built-in application page ) that are incorporated into the distribution of the media application, including markup data and resources for individual applications accessible through the start menu and other offering tiles of the media application. Application pages  represent customized application pages (such as customized application page ) that have been downloaded in package form, such as from a media information system server, including markup data and resources of customized applications within the media application. Such packages are typically downloaded to the client computer system on which the media application executes during expected idle periods (e.g., overnight). Web application pages (such as Web page ) may be linked to Web resources and downloaded via a network .","Portions of an example markup data listing included within an application package  for a customized application page (\u201cBrowse Categories\u201d) are listed below (although similar markup data could be used for a built-in application page).",{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0032","num":"0031"},"tables":{"@attributes":{"id":"TABLE-US-00001","num":"00001"},"table":{"@attributes":{"frame":"none","colsep":"0","rowsep":"0"},"tgroup":{"@attributes":{"align":"left","colsep":"0","rowsep":"0","cols":"2"},"colspec":[{"@attributes":{"colname":"1","colwidth":"49pt","align":"left"}},{"@attributes":{"colname":"2","colwidth":"168pt","align":"left"}}],"thead":{"row":{"entry":{"@attributes":{"namest":"1","nameend":"2","align":"center","rowsep":"1"}}}},"tbody":{"@attributes":{"valign":"top"},"row":[{"entry":[{},"<!-- Browse Categories page -->"]},{"entry":[{},"<UI Name=\u201cBrowseCategories\u201d BaseUI="]},{"entry":[{},"\u201cbpage:SpotlightBrowseBasePage\u201d>"]},{"entry":{"@attributes":{"namest":"1","nameend":"2","align":"center","rowsep":"1"}}}]}}}}},"The <UI Name=\u201cBrowseCategories\u201d . . . > element defines the user interface for the customized \u201cBrowse categories\u201d application page, which can be launched from the \u201cbrowse categories\u201d tile in the Online Media section of the Start menu.
