{"@attributes":{"id":"description"},"RELAPP":[{},{}],"p":["This application is the national stage application of International Application Serial No. PCT\/US2012\/072309, filed Dec. 31, 2012, which claims the benefit of U.S. Provisional Application Ser. No. 61\/581,179, filed on Dec. 29, 2012, which is incorporated herein by reference.","The present invention relates generally to polymeric sheeting materials, such as EPDM membranes, for roofing applications, that include expandable graphite as a flame retardant.","Ethylene-propylene-diene terpolymer (EPDM) is extensively used in a variety of applications. For example, it is particularly useful as a polymeric sheeting material that, because of its physical properties, flexibility, weathering resistance, low temperature properties and heat aging resistance, has gained acceptance as a roofing membrane for covering industrial and commercial roofs. These rubber roofing membranes are typically applied to the roof surface in a vulcanized or cured state and serve as an effective barrier to prevent the penetration of moisture to the covered roof.","These roofing membranes are typically prepared by compounding the base polymer of EPDM with appropriate fillers, processing oils, and other desired ingredients such as plasticizers, antidegradants, adhesive-enhancing promoters, etc., in a suitable mixer, and calendering the resulting compound into the desired thickness. The roofing membrane may also be cured by vulcanizing the resultant sheet in the presence of one or more vulcanizing agents and\/or compatible vulcanizing accelerators.","Mineral fillers such as clay, talc, silicas, mica, calcium carbonate, and the like are typically added to a roofing membrane formulation to increase burn resistivity, such as described in U.S. Pat. No. 5,468,550.","Roofing membranes typically also include flame retardants (FR). Decabromodiphenyl oxide (DBDPO) is a well known halogen-containing FR used in EPDM roofing membranes. However, DBDPO has become an environmental concern due to its high bromine content (83 wt %). Due to these concerns, and also to address regulatory changes in the industry, there exists a need for DBDPO-free polymeric compositions, which also provide flame retardant properties.","There is an ongoing desire to find materials that are useful as flame retardants within rubber roofing membranes and that do not have a deleterious impact on the rubber roofing membranes.","One or more embodiments of the present invention provide a roofing membrane comprising at least one layer of a cured rubber and expandable graphite dispersed within the cured rubber.","Embodiments of the present invention are based upon the discovery of a rubber roofing membrane including expandable graphite as a flame retardant. Advantageously, the membranes of one or more embodiments meet the performance standards as set forth in UL 94 and UL 790 even though the membranes are substantially devoid of halogen-containing flame retardants. Practice of the present invention has been found to be particularly useful in rubber membranes, such as EPDM membranes, and these membranes advantageously meet the performance standards of ASTM D 4637.","Membrane Construction","In one or more embodiments, the membranes of the present invention include cured rubber, expandable graphite, a filler, and an extender. Additionally, these membranes, which may be black or non-black, may include other constituents that are employed in rubber membranes or rubber compounds. The membranes include a cured network deriving from a vulcanizable rubber composition. The various other ingredients may be dispersed throughout the cured network. The membrane may also be referred to as a sheet. The membrane may further comprise fabric reinforcement. In certain embodiments, the membranes are devoid of halogen-containing flame retardants.","In one or more embodiments, the EPDM membrane employed in practice of the present invention includes a cured sheet of ethylene-propylene-diene copolymer rubber (EPDM). Dispersed within the crosslinked network of ethylene-propylene-diene copolymer may be various additives including, but not limited to, filler, oil, wax, antioxidant, antiozonant, flame retardant, and the like. The EPDM sheet may be a single-ply sheet or a multi-ply sheet. The EPDM sheet may be devoid of fabric reinforcement or it may include a fabric reinforcement positioned between two or more plies or layers of rubber.","In one or more embodiments, the membranes, although commonly referred to as single-ply roofing membranes, may include two or more layers that are compositionally distinct. The layers may be formed by calendering. For example, first and second sheets may be formed from first and second respective rubber compositions, and then the respective sheets can be mated and further calendered or laminated to one another, optionally with a reinforcing fabric therebetween. The skilled person will recognize, however, that these layers may be integral to the extent that the calendering and\/or curing process creates an interface, at some level, and the layers are generally inseparable. Nonetheless, reference can be made to the individual layers, especially where the layers derive from distinct compositions. Reference may also be made a multi-layered sheet.","In one or more embodiments, each layer of a multi-layered membrane or sheet may include expandable graphite according to the present invention. In other embodiments, a first layer may include expandable graphite and a second is devoid or substantially devoid of expandable graphite. Substantially devoid refers to the absence of that amount of expandable graphite that would otherwise have an appreciable impact on practice of the present invention. For example, in one embodiment, the membrane of the invention is a calendered sheet wherein a first composition including expandable graphite is calendered to form a first layer of the membrane, and a second composition that devoid or substantially devoid of expandable graphite is calendered to form a second layer of the membrane.","In one or more embodiments, the membranes of the present invention are two-layered membranes, wherein the first membrane is black in color and the second layer is non-black in color (e.g. white or generally white). As those skilled in the art appreciate, the black layer can derive from a black composition that would generally include carbon black as a filler. The black layer includes expandable graphite as contemplated by the present invention. The white layer can derive from a white composition that would generally include non-black fillers such as silica, titanium dioxide, and\/or clay. White EPDM membranes or membranes having a white EPDM layer are known in the art as disclosed in U.S. Ser. No. 12\/389,145, which is incorporated herein by reference.","Generally, the thickness of the sheet ranges from about 20 to about 100 mils, in other embodiments from about 35 to about 95 mils, and in other embodiments from about 45 to about 90 mils. In one or more embodiments, the EPDM sheet meets the performance standards of ASTM D4637.","Useful EPDM membrane is disclosed in, for example, U.S. Pat. Nos. 7,175,732, 6,502,360, 6,120,869, 5,849,133, 5,389,715, 4,810,565, 4,778,852, 4,732,925, and 4,657,958, which are incorporated herein by reference, as well as U.S. Ser.

In other embodiments, part of the EPDM can be added on top of the fillers, plasticizers, etc. This procedure can be further modified by withholding part of the process oil, and then adding it later. In one or more embodiments, two-stage mixing can be employed.","The sulfur cure package (sulfur\/accelerator) can be added near the end of the mixing cycle and at lower temperatures to prevent premature crosslinking of the EPDM polymer chains. When utilizing a type B Banbury internal mixer, the dry or powdery materials such as the carbon black and non-black mineral fillers (i.e., untreated clay, treated clays, talc, mica, and the like) can be added first, followed by the liquid process oil and finally the polymer (this type of mixing can be referred to as an upside-down mixing technique).","Once mixed, the rubber composition can then be formed into a sheet via calendering. The compositions of the invention can also be formed into various types of articles using other techniques such as extrusion.","The resultant rubbery compositions may be prepared in sheet form in any known manner such as by calendering or extrusion. The sheet may also be cut to a desired dimension. In one or more embodiments, the resulting admixture can be sheeted to thicknesses ranging from 5 to 200 mils, in other embodiments from 35 to 90 mils, by using conventional sheeting methods, for example, milling, calendering or extrusion. In one or more embodiments, the admixture is sheeted to at least 40 mils (0.040-inches), which is the minimum thickness specified in manufacturing standards established by the Roofing Council of the Rubber Manufacturers Association (RMA) for non-reinforced EPDM rubber sheets for use in roofing applications. In other embodiments, the admixture is sheeted to a thickness of about 45 mils, which is the thickness for a large percentage of \u201csingle-ply\u201droofing membranes used commercially. The sheeting can be visually inspected and cut to the desired length and width dimensions after curing.","The calendered sheeting itself should show good, uniform release from the upper and lower calendar rolls and have a smooth surface appearance (substantially free of bubbles, voids, fish eyes, tear drops, etc.). It should also have uniform release from the suction (vacuum) caps at the splicing table and uniform surface dusting at the dust box.","The membranes of the present invention can be optionally reinforced with scrim. In other embodiments, the membranes are devoid of scrim.","The roof sheeting membranes can be evaluated for physical properties using test methods developed for mechanical rubber goods. Typical properties include, among others, tensile strength, modulus, ultimate elongation, tear resistance, ozone resistance, water absorption, burn resistivity, and cured compound hardness.","Membrane Performance Standards","In one or more embodiments, the membranes of the invention demonstrate burn resistivity that meets or exceeds standards of flame spread such as tested by UL 94 and\/or UL 790. Further, the membranes of the invention meet standards of resistance to wind uplift as tested in accordance with test method UL 1897. In these or other embodiments, the membranes of the present invention meet the performance standards of ASTM D 4637.","Membrane Installation","The membranes of this invention may be unrolled over a roof substructure in a conventional fashion, wherein the seams of adjacent sheets are overlapped and mated by using, for example, an adhesive. The width of the seam can vary depending on the requirements specified by the architect, building contractor, or roofing contractor, and they thus do not constitute a limitation of the present invention. Seams can be joined with conventional adhesives such as, for instance, a butyl-based lap splice adhesive, which is commercially available from Firestone Building Products Company as SA-1065. Application can be facilitated by spray, brush, swab or other means known in the art. Also, field seams can be formed by using tape and companion primer such as QuickSeam\u2122 tape and Quick Prime Plus primer, both of which are commercially available from Firestone Building Products Company of Carmel, Ind.","Also, as is known in the art, these membranes can be secured to the roof substructure by using, for example, mechanical fasteners, adhesives (which are often employed to prepare a fully-adhered roofing system), or ballasting. Furthermore, the membranes of this invention are useful in combination with insulation or coverboards or in composite boards as disclosed in U.S. Pat. No. 7,972,688, which is incorporated herein by reference. It is also contemplated to use the concepts of the present invention in EPDM flashings such as those disclosed in U.S. Pat. No. 5,804,661, which is also incorporated herein by reference.","Other Polymeric Membranes","While aspects of this invention have thus far been described with respect to rubber membranes that include expandable graphite, it is also contemplated that expandable graphite may be dispersed within other polymeric membranes. Examples of these membranes include thermal plastic membranes such as thermoplastic vulcanizates (TPVs), thermoplastic olefins (TPOs), and polyvinyl chlorides (PVCs). Processing polymeric compositions further comprising expandable graphite is contemplated using processing techniques, including calendaring for example, that provide processing temperatures lower than the expansion onset temperature of said graphite.","PVC","In at least one embodiment of the present invention, polymeric compositions include polyvinyl chloride compositions further comprising expandable graphite as flame retardant.","In at least one embodiment of the present invention, polymeric compositions include polyvinyl chloride compositions further comprising expandable graphite as flame retardant. In one or more embodiments, the polymeric membranes of this invention include from about 5 to about 60, in other embodiments from about 10 to about 40, and in other embodiments from about 20 to about 25 parts by weight expandable graphite per 100 parts by weight elastomeric terpolymer. In certain embodiments, the polymeric membranes of this invention include at most 60 phr expandable graphite, in other embodiments at most 40 phr, in other embodiments at most 30 phr, in other embodiments at most 25 phr, and in other embodiments at most 20 phr. In certain embodiments, the polymeric membranes of this invention include at least 5 phr expandable graphite, in other embodiments at least 10 phr, in other embodiments at least 15 phr, and in other embodiments at least 20 phr.","In certain embodiments, the polymeric composition is devoid of flame retardants other than expandable graphite.","In order to demonstrate the practice of the present invention, the following examples have been prepared and tested. The examples should not, however, be viewed as limiting the scope of the invention. The claims will serve to define the invention.","Four non-black rubber formulations were prepared and tested for processing properties. Each rubber formulation included EPDM polymer together with the following ingredients, which amounts are based upon 100 parts by weight of the rubber: about 51 parts by weight (pbw) silica, about 58 pbw titanium dioxide, about 59 pbw oil, about 2 pbw hydrocarbon wax, about 5 pbw polyethylene wax, about 5 pbw zinc oxide, about 3.25 pbw stearic acid, about 2 pbw silane coupling agent, about 1.5 pbw sulfur, about 1.5 pbw of a dithiocarbamate accelerator, and about 0.3 pbw of a thiazole accelerator, as well as those additional ingredients provided in Table I (the ingredients are provided in parts by weight).
