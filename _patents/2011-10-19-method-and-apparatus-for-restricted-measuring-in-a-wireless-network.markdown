abstract: Methods and apparatuses are provided that include determining resources over which to measure signals from a base station. One or more parameters related to a resource restriction pattern can be provided to the device for measuring signals over indicated resources. The resource restricted pattern can correspond to a bitmap where each bit relates to a time period over which signals can be transmitted by the base station, and the bit can specify whether a signal received over the resource should be measured. The resource restriction pattern can correspond to a set or protected resources negotiated using a resource partitioning scheme.

Field","The following description relates generally to wireless network communications, and more particularly to measuring interference from base stations while accounting for inter-cell coordination of resources.","2. Background","Wireless communication systems are widely deployed to provide various types of communication content such as, for example, voice, data, and so on. Typical wireless communication systems may be multiple-access systems capable of supporting communication with multiple users by sharing available system resources (e.g., bandwidth, transmit power, . . . ). Examples of such multiple-access systems may include code division multiple access (CDMA) systems, time division multiple access (TDMA) systems, frequency division multiple access (FDMA) systems, orthogonal frequency division multiple access (OFDMA) systems, and the like. Additionally, the systems can conform to specifications such as third generation partnership project (3GPP) (e.g., 3GPP LTE (Long Term Evolution)\/LTE-Advanced), ultra mobile broadband (UMB), evolution data optimized (EV-DO), etc.","Generally, wireless multiple-access communication systems may simultaneously support communication for multiple mobile devices. Each mobile device may communicate with one or more base stations via transmissions on forward and reverse links. The forward link (or downlink) refers to the communication link from base stations to mobile devices, and the reverse link (or uplink) refers to the communication link from mobile devices to base stations. Further, communications between mobile devices and base stations may be established via single-input single-output (SISO) systems, multiple-input single-output (MISO) systems, multiple-input multiple-output (MIMO) systems, and so forth.","In addition, some wireless networks allow deployment of low power base stations (e.g., femto nodes, pico nodes, micro nodes, etc.), to which a device can connect to receive alternative wireless network access. For example, the low power base station can communicate with the wireless network over a broadband or other backhaul connection (e.g., a digital subscriber line (DSL) connection, T1 connection, cable connection, etc.), while also providing an access link over which devices can communicate therewith to receive access to the wireless network.","For example, low power base stations can be deployed within macrocell base station coverage areas, which can result in multiple levels of interference where the base stations operate in a similar and\/or adjacent frequency spectrum, such as interference to devices communicating therewith, interference to the low power base stations and macrocell base station from devices communicating therewith, etc. Resource partitioning schemes, such as enhanced inter-cell interference coordination (eICIC), have been implemented to allow the low power base stations and macrocell base stations to negotiate transmission (and\/or reception) radio resources to avoid such interference. In these schemes, a low power base station can schedule device communications in different time periods than the macrocell base station uses to schedule devices. Thus, interference for a given base station can vary over a given set of resources.","The following presents a simplified summary of one or more aspects in order to provide a basic understanding of such aspects. This summary is not an extensive overview of all contemplated aspects, and is intended to neither identify key or critical elements of all aspects nor delineate the scope of any or all aspects. Its sole purpose is to present some concepts of one or more aspects in a simplified form as a prelude to the more detailed description that is presented later.","In accordance with one or more aspects and corresponding disclosure thereof, the present disclosure describes various aspects in connection with determining at least one set of communication resources over which to measure signals from a base station. For example, certain communication resources of the base station can be interfered by communications from other base stations, and thus the determined set of communications resources can correspond to at least a portion of resources that are not subject to such interference. The base station can negotiate communication resources with the other base stations, in one example, and can provide an indication of the negotiated resources to facilitate measurement thereover. In another example, the base station can provide an indication of an interfered set of resources to the device for measuring and\/or for determining a complementary set of resources over which a level of interference is uncertain. Moreover, in other examples, parameters defining a duty cycle for measuring signals from the base station can be determined by a device or otherwise signaled by the base station.","According to an example, a method for wireless communications is provided that includes receiving signals from a base station over a set of resources and receiving one or more parameters related to a restricted resource pattern (RRP) for measuring signals from the base station over a first portion of resources from the set of resources. The method also includes measuring signals over the first portion of resources based on the one or more parameters to determine one or more signal measurements and performing one or more physical layer procedures based on the one or more signal measurements.","In another aspect, an apparatus for wireless communication is provided. The apparatus includes means for receiving signals from a base station over a set of resources and means for receiving one or more parameters related to a RRP for measuring signals from the base station over a first portion of resources over the set of resources. The apparatus also includes means for measuring signals over the first portion of resources based on the one or more parameters to determine one or more signal measurements and means for performing one or more physical layer procedures based on the one or more signal measurements.","In yet another aspect, an apparatus for wireless communication is provided including at least one processor configured to receive signals from a base station over a set of resources and receive one or more parameters related to a RRP for measuring signals from the base station over a first portion of resources from the set of resources. The at least one processor is further configured to measure signals over the first portion of resources based on the one or more parameters to determine one or more signal measurements and perform one or more physical layer procedures based on the one or more signal measurements. The apparatus further includes a memory coupled to the at least one processor.","Still, in another aspect, a computer-program product for wireless communication is provided including a computer-readable medium having code for causing at least one computer to receive signals from a base station over a set of resources and code for causing the at least one computer to receive one or more parameters related to a RRP for measuring signals from the base station over a first portion of resources from the set of resources. The computer-readable medium further includes code for causing the at least one computer to measure signals over the first portion of resources based on the one or more parameters to determine one or more signal measurements and code for causing the at least one computer to perform one or more physical layer procedures based on the one or more signal measurements.","According to another example, a method of wireless communication is provided that includes determining a RRP for measuring signals transmitted over a set of resources and communicating one or more parameters corresponding to the RRP to a device","In another aspect, an apparatus for wireless communication is provided. The apparatus includes means for determining a RRP for measuring signals transmitted over a set of resources. The apparatus also includes means for communicating one or more parameters corresponding to the RRP to a device.","In yet another aspect, an apparatus for wireless communication is provided including at least one processor configured to determine a RRP for measuring signals transmitted over a set of resources. The at least one processor is further configured to communicate one or more parameters corresponding to the RRP to a device. The apparatus further includes a memory coupled to the at least one processor.","Still, in another aspect, a computer-program product for wireless communication is provided including a computer-readable medium having code for causing at least one computer to determine a RRP for measuring signals transmitted over a set of resources. The computer-readable medium further includes code for causing the at least one computer to communicate one or more parameters corresponding to the RRP to a device.","To the accomplishment of the foregoing and related ends, the one or more aspects comprise the features hereinafter fully described and particularly pointed out in the claims. The following description and the annexed drawings set forth in detail certain illustrative features of the one or more aspects. These features are indicative, however, of but a few of the various ways in which the principles of various aspects may be employed, and this description is intended to include all such aspects and their equivalents.","Various aspects are now described with reference to the drawings. In the following description, for purposes of explanation, numerous specific details are set forth in order to provide a thorough understanding of one or more aspects. It may be evident, however, that such aspect(s) may be practiced without these specific details.","Described further herein are various considerations related to a device measuring signals from a base station over a determined set of resources. In one example, the set of resources can be determined as resources that are not subject to interference from one or more other base stations. For example, such resources can be negotiated between the base station and one or more other base stations using a resource partitioning scheme, such as enhanced inter-cell interference cancellation (eICIC), and\/or the like. Thus, the base station can indicate at least a portion of the negotiated resources to the device for performing measurements of signals from the base station over the negotiated resources. In this regard, the measurements of the signals can be free from interference by the one or more other base stations.","In another example, the base station can indicate a portion of resources known to have interference from the one or more other base stations (e.g., resources negotiated by the one or more other base stations) to the device. In this example, the device can additionally determine a complementary portion of the resources for which an interference level is unknown, and can determine whether to utilize any of the complementary portion of resources for measuring signals from the base station. In yet another example, duty cycle parameters can be determined by and\/or otherwise signaled to the device for indicating resources over which the device can measure signals from the base station. In any case, the measurements performed by the device can be for the purpose of interference averaging, which can be used by one or more radio link monitoring (RLM) procedures (e.g., radio link failure (RLF)), one or more radio resource management (RRM) functions (e.g., neighbor cell measurements for reselection), one or more channel state information (CSI) feedback operations (e.g., channel quality indicator (CQI) reporting), and\/or the like.","As used in this application, the terms \u201ccomponent,\u201d \u201cmodule,\u201d \u201csystem\u201d and the like are intended to include a computer-related entity, such as but not limited to hardware, firmware, a combination of hardware and software, software, or software in execution, etc. For example, a component may be, but is not limited to being, a process running on a processor, a processor, an object, an executable, a thread of execution, a program, and\/or a computer. By way of illustration, both an application running on a computing device and the computing device can be a component. One or more components can reside within a process and\/or thread of execution and a component may be localized on one computer and\/or distributed between two or more computers. In addition, these components can execute from various computer readable media having various data structures stored thereon. The components may communicate by way of local and\/or remote processes such as in accordance with a signal having one or more data packets, such as data from one component interacting with another component in a local system, distributed system, and\/or across a network such as the Internet with other systems by way of the signal.","Furthermore, various aspects are described herein in connection with a terminal, which can be a wired terminal or a wireless terminal. A terminal can also be called a system, device, subscriber unit, subscriber station, mobile station, mobile, mobile device, remote station, remote terminal, access terminal, user terminal, terminal, communication device, user agent, user device, or user equipment (UE), etc. A wireless terminal may be a cellular telephone, a satellite phone, a cordless telephone, a Session Initiation Protocol (SIP) phone, a wireless local loop (WLL) station, a personal digital assistant (PDA), a handheld device having wireless connection capability, a computing device, a tablet, a smart book, a netbook, or other processing devices connected to a wireless modem, etc. Moreover, various aspects are described herein in connection with a base station. A base station may be utilized for communicating with wireless terminal(s) and may also be referred to as an access point, a Node B, evolved Node B (eNB), or some other terminology.","Moreover, the term \u201cor\u201d is intended to mean an inclusive \u201cor\u201d rather than an exclusive \u201cor.\u201d That is, unless specified otherwise, or clear from the context, the phrase \u201cX employs A or B\u201d is intended to mean any of the natural inclusive permutations. That is, the phrase \u201cX employs A or B\u201d is satisfied by any of the following instances: X employs A; X employs B; or X employs both A and B. In addition, the articles \u201ca\u201d and \u201can\u201d as used in this application and the appended claims should generally be construed to mean \u201cone or more\u201d unless specified otherwise or clear from the context to be directed to a singular form.","The techniques described herein may be used for various wireless communication systems such as CDMA, TDMA, FDMA, OFDMA, SC-FDMA and other systems. The terms \u201csystem\u201d and \u201cnetwork\u201d are often used interchangeably. A CDMA system may implement a radio technology such as Universal Terrestrial Radio Access (UTRA), cdma2000, etc. UTRA includes Wideband-CDMA (W-CDMA) and other variants of CDMA. Further, cdma2000 covers IS-2000, IS-95 and IS-856 standards. A TDMA system may implement a radio technology such as Global System for Mobile Communications (GSM). An OFDMA system may implement a radio technology such as Evolved UTRA (E-UTRA), Ultra Mobile Broadband (UMB), IEEE 802.11 (Wi-Fi), IEEE 802.16 (WiMAX), IEEE 802.20, Flash-OFDM\u00ae, etc. UTRA and E-UTRA are part of Universal Mobile Telecommunication System (UMTS). 3GPP Long Term Evolution (LTE) is a release of UMTS that uses E-UTRA, which employs OFDMA on the downlink and SC-FDMA on the uplink. UTRA, E-UTRA, UMTS, LTE\/LTE-Advanced and GSM are described in documents from an organization named \u201c3rd Generation Partnership Project\u201d (3GPP). Additionally, cdma2000 and UMB are described in documents from an organization named \u201c3rd Generation Partnership Project 2\u201d (3GPP2). Further, such wireless communication systems may additionally include peer-to-peer (e.g., mobile-to-mobile) ad hoc network systems often using unpaired unlicensed spectrums, 802.xx wireless LAN, BLUETOOTH and any other short- or long-range, wireless communication techniques.","Various aspects or features will be presented in terms of systems that may include a number of devices, components, modules, and the like. It is to be understood and appreciated that the various systems may include additional devices, components, modules, etc. and\/or may not include all of the devices, components, modules etc. discussed in connection with the figures. A combination of these approaches may also be used.",{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0041","num":"0040"},"figref":"FIG. 1","b":["100","100","102","104","108","104","100","106","108","102","104","106","102","106","108","104","106","104","102","104","106","110"]},"According to an example, device  can communicate with base station  to receive wireless network access and can perform physical layer procedures involving measuring base station  and\/or other base stations. For example, such procedures can include RLM procedures, such as detecting RLF, RRM functions, such as measuring cells for active mode hand-in or reselection, CSI operations, such as measuring CQI or other quality measurements for reporting to base station , and\/or the like. In this example, device  can accordingly periodically measure signals  in the serving cell  as well as signals  from one or more neighboring cells to determine an average signal quality or an average interference. For example, the measurements can comprise signal-to-noise ratio (SNR), carrier-to-interference-and-noise ratio (CINR), received signal strength indicator (RSSI), reference signal received power (RSRP), reference signal received quality (RSRQ), and\/or similar measurements. Since signals from base station  can be interfered by signals from base station  as received at the device , however, device  can determine a set of resources over which to measure signals from base station  to avoid interference from base station  and\/or other base stations.","In one example, device  can receive an indication of a set of resources over which to measure signals from base station . For example, the indication can correspond to a bitmap that specifies whether each of a plurality of resources (e.g., subframes) can be measured by the device . In one example, the device can receive the bitmap from the base station  upon initializing communications therewith (e.g., in an RRC message), based on requesting such information from base station , and\/or the like. Base station  can generate the bitmap to correspond to protected resources negotiated with one or more base stations, such as base station ; thus, the bitmap can specify at least a portion of the protected resources for measuring by device . The bitmap can correspond to a fixed or variable number of resources and can be repetitively used to determine subsequent resources for measuring.","In another example, base station  can also communicate an indication of a set of resources that are interfered by one or more base stations, such as base station , to device . Device  can determine a complementary set of resources based on the set of resources over which to measure signals from base station  (e.g., a set of resources with little or no interference) and the set of resources that are interfered by one or more base stations. The complementary set can correspond to resources over which a level of interference is not known by base station . Thus, in an example, the device can further utilize the complementary set in measuring the base station . This can include performing measurements over resources in the complementary set, not performing measurements over resources in the complementary set, performing measurements over certain resources in the complementary set (e.g., according to a duty cycle, according to resource groupings relating to retransmission, based on a blind interference detection of signals over the complementary set of resources, etc.), and\/or the like.","In yet another example, device  can define a duty cycle and\/or a number of subframes over which to measure signals from base station . For example, the duty cycle and\/or subframe parameters can be received from base station  or other network component and\/or can be determined based on one or more configured or hardcoded parameters, a history of previous parameters, and\/or the like. For example, a duty cycle can correspond to a period of time (e.g., a number of subframes) between measurements of signals from base station , and the number of subframes can be a maximum number of subframes over which to receive signals for measuring within the duty cycle. In an example, a time period for the duty cycle can be based in part on a retransmission time period. In any case, the device  can perform measurements at least over partitioned resources to mitigate considering interfered resources for the purposes of one or more physical layer procedures.",{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0046","num":"0045"},"figref":"FIG. 2","b":["200","200","102","200","202","204","206","208","200","210","212","214","216"]},"According to an example, receiving module  can obtain signals for base station measurement. For example, the signals can be received from the base station (not shown) and can correspond to one or more pilot signals or other signals transmitted by the base station. The signals transmitted by the base station can be interfered over some resources, and resource restriction determining module  can accordingly determine a set of resources over which to obtain signal measurements. In one example, resource restriction determining module  can obtain one or more resource restriction patterns (RRP) for signal measurements. Resource restriction determining module , in this example, can receive the RRP(s) from the base station or one or more other network components. The RRP(s) can comprise one or more bitmaps  where each bit can represent whether signals are to be measured over a corresponding subframe. Moreover, the RRP(s) can be received from the base station in a RRC message, such as an RRCConnectionReconfiguration message for establishing a radio bearer with the base stations.","In this example, signal measuring module  can measure the signals from the base station over the resources indicated in the RRP bitmap . For example, the bitmap  can indicate measurement assignments over protected resources negotiated by the base station using a resource partitioning scheme (e.g., eICIC). Thus, measurements performed over the protected resources indicated in the RRP bitmap  can be substantially free of interference from one or more other base stations. In addition, the RRP bitmap  can be of substantially any length and can correspond to a number of previously received subframes either explicitly (e.g., based on a subframe number (SFN)), beginning with a current subframe, etc. For example, each bit in the bitmap  can represent a portion of a time period for a retransmission scheme, such as hybrid automatic repeat\/request (HARQ), a portion of a time period of a communication frame, a lowest common multiple thereof or other function, and\/or the like. In a specific LTE example using frequency division duplexing (FDD), where a HARQ retransmission time period is 8 milliseconds (ms), and a communication frame is 10 ms, the bitmap  can be 40 ms (the lowest common multiple of 8 ms and 10 ms), where each bit represents 1 ms (e.g., one explicit subframe in LTE). Signal measuring module  can measure signals received over a portion of the previous 40 subframes, as indicated in the RRP.","For example, resource restriction determining module  can receive a RRP bitmap  similar to the following:\n\n","The above bitmap , for example, is 40 bits and can specify to measure in a current subframe (based on the first bit), as well as subframes at 8, 16, 24, and 32 subframes from the current subframe. This can correlate to a HARQ retransmission scheme in LTE, and thus the current subframe and subframes that are multiples of 8 ms away can have the same or similar interference. In this regard, the bitmap  represents groups of subframes that are 8 ms apart as having similar interference in FDD. In other examples, such as time division duplexing (TDD), grouping may be more complicated since the retransmission time period can be variable. Thus the bitmap  in TDD configurations can be fixed, variable to match the retransmission time period (e.g., based on a lowest common multiple with the communication frame time period or otherwise), etc. As described further herein, for TDD subframes can be grouped based on determining subframes of similar interference, which can include uplink HARQ subframes used for communicating HARQ indicators for associated downlink subframes, as well as subframes during which retransmission occurs for the downlink subframes, and\/or the like.","The bitmap  can be similar to a measSubframePattern in LTE, which can be used to specify time domain measurement resource restriction. In this example, the first\/leftmost bit corresponds to the subframe # of the radio frame satisfying SFN mod x=0, where SFN is that of a primary cell, PCell, and x is the size of the bit string divided by 10. Also, in this example, \u201c1\u201d can denote that the corresponding subframe is used for measurement.","Thus, signal measuring module  can measure signals from the base station over resources indicated in the RRP bitmap  (e.g., resources with a corresponding bit set to one). For example, in LTE, this can be based on at least one of associating the bits in the bitmap  with explicit SFNs of subframes over which signals are received from the base station, using a sliding measurement window to associate the bits with the subframes based on a current subframe, and\/or the like. Signal measuring module  can then measure signals over the subframes based on whether a given bit indicates measurement. In an example, signal measuring module  can generate an interference average over the resources based on the signal measurements.","Physical layer procedure module  can perform one or more physical layer procedures using the signal measurements and\/or interference average, such as an RLM procedure, RRM function, a CSI operation, and\/or the like. For example, an RLM procedure can include RLF detecting module  attempting to detect RLF based on the measurements of the base station (e.g., where an average measurement over the protected resources is below a threshold level). In another example, physical layer procedure module  can generate a CQI report, measurement report, etc. using the measurements and\/or an average thereof. Because measurements without interference are utilized in this regard, the physical layer procedures can produce more accurate results with respect to the base station.","In another example, resources that are not specified for measurement in the RRP bitmap  can correspond to resources over which presence and\/or level of interference is not known by the base station. In one example, signal measuring module  can ignore measurements received over such resources for determining measurements of the base station. In another example, however, signal measuring module  can additionally measure signals received over at least a portion of these resources. For example, signal measuring module  can average signal measurements over all resources not specified for measurement in the RRP, or over at least a portion of such resources according to one or more duty cycle parameters. For example, the duty cycle parameters can be received or generated by duty cycle determining module  to include a duty cycle T related to a period for measuring signals and\/or a maximum number of subframes N over which signals can be measured in the given duty cycle T, as described further herein. Moreover, the duty cycle parameters can include an offset for utilizing the duty cycle. In either case, for example, signal measuring module  can utilize a portion of the measurements along with those measurements over the resources indicated in the RRP bitmap , separately provide at least the portion of the measurements over the resources not specified for measurement to the physical layer procedure module , and\/or the like.","Thus, for example, physical layer procedure module  can perform physical layer procedures separately for the resources not specified for measurement. For example, physical layer procedure module  can report CQI for the resources indicated in the RRP bitmap , and separately report CQI for the resources not specified for measurement in the bitmap .","In another example, interference detecting module  can attempt to determine a level of interference over the resources not specified for measurement in the RRP bitmap . For instance, interference detecting module  can perform interference estimation over one or more of the resources to determine resources having a low level of interference (e.g., satisfying a threshold). In this example, signal measuring module  can provide signal measurements over the resources to physical layer procedure module  as well and\/or can indicate the resources to resource restriction determining module , which can update the bitmap  to include the resources (e.g., for a measurement in a subsequent time period of the bitmap ). Similarly, interference detecting module  can determine one or more of the resources having a high level of interference (e.g., satisfying a threshold), and can separately provide such measurements to physical layer procedure module  for separate reporting, and\/or resource restriction determining module  can indicate the resources in a separate bitmap corresponding to interfered resources, as described further herein.","For example, interference detecting module  can perform blind interference detection over the resources not specified for measurement in the RRP bitmap  (e.g., resources having a corresponding bit set to zero). If an interference measurement is similar to a level of interference over a resource indicated for measurement in the bitmap , for example, interference detecting module  can determine that the resource over which the blind interference detection is performed can be measured. In another example, interference detecting module  can determine one or more resources corresponding to cross-subframe scheduling assignments (e.g., subframes indicated for transmitting paging signals, system information blocks (SIB), such as SIB, and\/or the like). Since such subframes typically have low interference (e.g., due to resource partitioning or otherwise known reservation for communicating such signals), interference detecting module  can additionally determine that signals can be measured over such subframes. Where additional resources are so determined for measurement, interference detecting module  can notify resource restriction determining module  to accordingly modify the bitmap  to include such resources and\/or can indicate such to signal measuring module  to allow measuring over the resources.","In another example, retransmission resource grouping module  can generate or otherwise receive groupings of resources (e.g., subframes) for the purpose of retransmission. Resource restriction determining module  can provide the RRP bitmap  to retransmission resource grouping module , which can determine whether additional resources can be utilized for measuring signals from the base station based on the retransmission resource grouping. For example, for a given subframe in LTE, retransmission resource grouping module  can associate the subframe with other subframes in a communication frame based on a subframe over which HARQ acknowledgement indicators for communications in the subframe occur and\/or based on other subframes having a similar assigned HARQ retransmission subframe, as described further below. For example, a similar level of interference can be expected over the grouping of subframes at least since the subframes can have similar resource partitioning to allow for reliable operation of the retransmission scheme. Thus, for a subframe indicated for measurement in the RRP bitmap , retransmission resource grouping module  can indicate or otherwise update the bitmap  with related subframes in a grouping with the subframe for additional measuring in a current or subsequent time period. Such grouping can be applied in TDD configurations, one possible example of which is illustrated in . In another example, retransmission resource grouping module  can notify signal measuring module  of the similar subframes for current signal measurements.","In another example, resource restriction determining module  can obtain another bitmap  from the base station that indicates a set of interfered resources. For example, the base station can indicate, in the bitmap , resources negotiated for utilization by other base stations. In another example, the base station can determine the resources based on CQI reported from apparatus  and\/or other devices. In any case, signal measuring module  can determine to refrain from measuring signals received over the resources. Additionally, in this example, there can be a complementary set of resources that are not indicated in either bitmap  (e.g., the bitmap of interfered resources or the bitmap corresponding to the RRP), and thus interference is not known for the set of complementary resources. In this example, similar concepts (e.g., blind detection, etc., as described above) can be applied to determine at least one of whether to allow signal measuring module  to measure signals over at least a portion of the set of complementary resources, whether to cause resource restriction determining module  to update bitmap  to indicate measurement over at least the portion of the set of complementary resources, and\/or the like.","In other examples, resource restriction determining module  can determine resources over which to measure signals from a base station based on one or more duty cycle parameters. For example, duty cycle determining module  can generate or otherwise receive the one or more parameters, which can include duty cycle T, maximum number of subframes N, and\/or the like. Duty cycle determining module , in one example, can generate at least one of the parameters based on a configuration, a historical analysis of the parameter (e.g., which parameters produce the most accurate measurements), and\/or the like. In another example, duty cycle determining module  can determine the parameters from a hardcoding or receive the parameters from the base station or other network components, etc. In either case, resource restriction determining module  can select one or more subframes in a duty cycle T of subframes based on the maximum number N of subframes, and signal measuring module  can measure signals received over the subframes. In one specific example, T can be 1 and N can be 2 to facilitate measuring consecutive subframes. In other examples, additional duty cycles can be specified by duty cycle determining module . In one example, the duty cycles can include Tand T, with maximum number of subframes Nand N. Thus, resource restriction determining module , in one example, can select subframes n (a current subframe), n\u2212T, . . . , n\u2212(N\u22121)T, n\u2212T, n\u2212T\u2212T, . . . , n\u2212iT\u2212jTfor i<Nand j<N, for measuring.","Further, for example, the RRP bitmap  can be generated by the base station to be specific to a given device, such as apparatus .

In one example, resource partitioning module  can negotiate different resources with different base stations based on availability, location of the different base stations, and\/or the like. RRP defining module  can generate a RRP for measuring signals from apparatus , which can be in the form of bitmap . For example, RRP defining module  can generate RRP bitmap  to specify whether resources related to each bit should be measured (e.g., whether the resources correspond to protected resources that should be free from interference).","In LTE, for example, the bitmap  can be 40 bits, where each bit corresponds to a 1 ms subframe. Starting at a current or otherwise explicitly identified subframe, the bitmap  can indicate whether signals received over a subframe a number of ms away from the current subframe should be measured for the purposes of one or more physical layer procedures at a device. For example, this can include reporting CSI and\/or measurement reports back to apparatus , and in one example, CSI receiving module  can obtain the CSI.

In any case, RRP providing module  can communicate the RRP bitmap  to one or more devices for measuring signals transmitted by apparatus .","In another example, RRP defining module  can generate a bitmap  of interfered resources. For example, the bitmap  of interfered resources can also be based on resource partitioning module  indicating one or more resources negotiated by one or more base stations (e.g., resources over which the one or more base stations can transmit signals with minimal interference from apparatus ). Thus, RRP providing module  can additionally provide this bitmap  to the one or more devices, which can allow the one or more devices to distinguish between resources for measuring signals from the apparatus from resources over which to avoid such signal measurement. In addition, the device can determine a complementary set of resources for further determining whether to measure. In either case, the device can also measure over interfered resources and\/or the complementary set, and provide separate CSI therefor; thus, CSI receiving module  can receive CSI as indicated for the interfered resources as well.","Moreover, since the RRP bitmap  can be defined for different base stations (e.g., based on resources negotiated with the different base stations), RRP providing module  can select and provide a RRP bitmap  to a device based on location of the device. For example, device location determining module  can determine a location of a device (at least relative to apparatus  and\/or other base stations), and can provide the location information to RRP providing module  for determining a bitmap  that corresponds to potential interference at the device based in part on the location. In one example, device location determining module  can determine that the device is near one or more base stations based on a measurement report received from the device, and can provide information regarding the one or more base stations to RRP providing module . In this example, RRP providing module  can select and provide to the device a bitmap  that indicates resources negotiated with the one or more base stations as resources for measuring signals from apparatus . In other examples, device location determining module  can determine the location of the device based on one or more other received parameters (e.g., a GPS location, known location of the one or more base stations, etc.) and can select a bitmap  related to one or more base stations nearest to the device that can potentially cause interference thereto when receiving signals from apparatus .","In yet another example, duty cycle providing module  can provide one or more duty cycle parameters to the device, such as a duty cycle T, a maximum number of subframes N, and\/or the like.

The one or more parameters can include a RRP bitmap (e.g., received from a base station over RRC signaling) that specifies which of the set of resources can be used to compute signal measurements of the base station. Each bit in the bitmap can correspond to a subframe, in one example, starting with a current subframe and including a plurality of prior subframes where a bit set to one can indicate that signals in the subframe can be measured, while a bit set to zero can indicate to not measure signals over the corresponding subframe.
