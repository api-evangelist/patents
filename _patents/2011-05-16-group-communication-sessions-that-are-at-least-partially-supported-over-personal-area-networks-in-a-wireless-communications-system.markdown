title: Group communication sessions that are at least partially supported over personal area networks in a wireless communications system
abstract: In an embodiment, an application server receives a request to initiate a group communication session (GCS) over a Wireless Wide Area Network (WWAN) with a communication group. The application server obtains location information of a set of devices participating in the GCS and determines that the GCS can be supported between the set of devices via a Personal Area Network (PAN), after which the application server transitions support for the GCS from the WWAN to the PAN. In another embodiment, an originator begins a periodic broadcast of a local PAN signal announcing the GCS after failing to set-up the GCS via the WWAN. Target device(s) in the communication group receive the local PAN signal, determine not to transmit their own local PAN signal and then convey a session acceptance message to the originator. The GCS is then established between the target device(s) and the originator over the PAN.

{"@attributes":{"id":"description"},"BRFSUM":[{},{}],"heading":["BACKGROUND","SUMMARY","DETAILED DESCRIPTION"],"p":["1. Field of the Invention","Embodiments of the invention relate to group communication sessions that are at least partially supported over personal area networks (PANs) in a wireless communications system.","2. Relevant Background","Wireless communication systems have developed through various generations, including a first-generation analog wireless phone service (1G), a second-generation (2G) digital wireless phone service (including interim 2.5G and 2.75G networks) and a third-generation (3G) high speed data\/Internet-capable wireless service. There are presently many different types of wireless communication systems in use, including Cellular and Personal Communications Service (PCS) systems. Examples of known cellular systems include the cellular Analog Advanced Mobile Phone System (AMPS), and digital cellular systems based on Code Division Multiple Access (CDMA), Frequency Division Multiple Access (FDMA), Time Division Multiple Access (TDMA), the Global System for Mobile access (GSM) variation of TDMA, and newer hybrid digital communication systems using both TDMA and CDMA technologies.","The method for providing CDMA mobile communications was standardized in the United States by the Telecommunications Industry Association\/Electronic Industries Association in TIA\/EIA\/IS-95-A entitled \u201cMobile Station-Base Station Compatibility Standard for Dual-Mode Wideband Spread Spectrum Cellular System,\u201d referred to herein as IS-95. Combined AMPS & CDMA systems are described in TIA\/EIA Standard IS-98. Other communications systems are described in the IMT-2000\/UM, or International Mobile Telecommunications System 2000\/Universal Mobile Telecommunications System, standards covering what are referred to as wideband CDMA (W-CDMA), CDMA2000 (such as CDMA2000 1xEV-DO standards, for example) or TD-SCDMA.","In W-CDMA wireless communication systems, user equipments (UEs) receive signals from fixed position Node Bs (also referred to as cell sites or cells) that support communication links or service within particular geographic regions adjacent to or surrounding the base stations. Node Bs provide entry points to an access network (AN)\/radio access network (RAN), which is generally a packet data network using standard Internet Engineering Task Force (IETF) based protocols that support methods for differentiating traffic based on Quality of Service (QoS) requirements. Therefore, the Node Bs generally interact with UEs through an over the air interface and with the RAN through Internet Protocol (IP) network data packets.","Wireless repeaters can be positioned within wireless communication systems in order to extend the range or coverage area of one or more Node Bs. In the uplink direction, the wireless repeaters receive signals from UEs and retransmit the received signals to a given Node B. In the downlink direction, the wireless repeaters receive signals from the given Node B and retransmit the received signals to UEs.","In an embodiment, an application server receives a request to initiate a group communication session (GCS) over a Wireless Wide Area Network (WWAN) with a communication group. The application server obtains location information of a set of devices participating in the GCS and determines that the GCS can be supported between the set of devices via a Personal Area Network (PAN), after which the application server transitions support for the GCS from the WWAN to the PAN. In another embodiment, an originator begins a periodic broadcast of a local PAN signal announcing the GCS after failing to set-up the GCS via the WWAN. Target device(s) in the communication group receive the local PAN signal, determine not to transmit their own local PAN signal and then convey a session acceptance message to the originator. The GCS is then established between the target device(s) and the originator over the PAN.","Aspects of the invention are disclosed in the following description and related drawings directed to specific embodiments of the invention. Alternate embodiments may be devised without departing from the scope of the invention. Additionally, well-known elements of the invention will not be described in detail or will be omitted so as not to obscure the relevant details of the invention.","The words \u201cexemplary\u201d and\/or \u201cexample\u201d are used herein to mean \u201cserving as an example, instance, or illustration.\u201d Any embodiment described herein as \u201cexemplary\u201d and\/or \u201cexample\u201d is not necessarily to be construed as preferred or advantageous over other embodiments. Likewise, the term \u201cembodiments of the invention\u201d does not require that all embodiments of the invention include the discussed feature, advantage or mode of operation.","Further, many embodiments are described in terms of sequences of actions to be performed by, for example, elements of a computing device. It will be recognized that various actions described herein can be performed by specific circuits (e.g., application specific integrated circuits (ASICs)), by program instructions being executed by one or more processors, or by a combination of both. Additionally, these sequence of actions described herein can be considered to be embodied entirely within any form of computer readable storage medium having stored therein a corresponding set of computer instructions that upon execution would cause an associated processor to perform the functionality described herein. Thus, the various aspects of the invention may be embodied in a number of different forms, all of which have been contemplated to be within the scope of the claimed subject matter. In addition, for each of the embodiments described herein, the corresponding form of any such embodiments may be described herein as, for example, \u201clogic configured to\u201d perform the described action.","A High Data Rate (HDR) subscriber station, referred to herein as a user equipment (UE), may be mobile or stationary, and may communicate with one or more access points (APs), which may be referred to as Node Bs. A UE transmits and receives data packets through one or more of the Node Bs to a Radio Network Controller (RNC). The Node Bs and RNC are parts of a network called a radio access network (RAN). A radio access network can transport voice and data packets between multiple access terminals.","The radio access network may be further connected to additional networks outside the radio access network, such core network including specific carrier related servers and devices and connectivity to other networks such as a corporate intranet, the Internet, public switched telephone network (PSTN), a Serving General Packet Radio Services (GPRS) Support Node (SGSN), a Gateway GPRS Support Node (GGSN), and may transport voice and data packets between each UE and such networks. A UE that has established an active traffic channel connection with one or more Node Bs may be referred to as an active UE, and can be referred to as being in a traffic state. A UE that is in the process of establishing an active traffic channel (TCH) connection with one or more Node Bs can be referred to as being in a connection setup state. A UE may be any data device that communicates through a wireless channel or through a wired channel. A UE may further be any of a number of types of devices including but not limited to PC card, compact flash device, external or internal modem, or wireless or wireline phone. The communication link through which the UE sends signals to the Node B(s) is called an uplink channel (e.g., a reverse traffic channel, a control channel, an access channel, etc.). The communication link through which Node B(s) send signals to a UE is called a downlink channel (e.g., a paging channel, a control channel, a broadcast channel, a forward traffic channel, etc.). As used herein the term traffic channel (TCH) can refer to either an uplink\/reverse or downlink\/forward traffic channel.",{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0031","num":"0030"},"figref":"FIG. 1","b":["100","100","102","104","120","102","126","102","108","110","112","102","108","110","112"]},"Referring back to , the components of the wireless communications system  and interrelation of the elements of the exemplary embodiments of the invention are not limited to the configuration illustrated. System  is merely exemplary and can include any system that allows remote UEs, such as wireless client computing devices , , ,  to communicate over-the-air between and among each other and\/or between and among components connected via the air interface  and RAN , including, without limitation, core network , the Internet, PSTN, SGSN, GGSN and\/or other remote servers.","The RAN  controls messages (typically sent as data packets) sent to a RNC . The RNC  is responsible for signaling, establishing, and tearing down bearer channels (i.e., data channels) between a Serving General Packet Radio Services (GPRS) Support Node (SGSN) and the UEs \/\/\/. If link layer encryption is enabled, the RNC  also encrypts the content before forwarding it over the air interface . The function of the RNC  is well-known in the art and will not be discussed further for the sake of brevity. The core network  may communicate with the RNC  by a network, the Internet and\/or a public switched telephone network (PSTN). Alternatively, the RNC  may connect directly to the Internet or external network. Typically, the network or Internet connection between the core network  and the RNC  transfers data, and the PSTN transfers voice information. The RNC  can be connected to multiple Node Bs . In a similar manner to the core network , the RNC  is typically connected to the Node Bs  by a network, the Internet and\/or PSTN for data transfer and\/or voice information. The Node Bs  can broadcast data messages wirelessly to the UEs, such as cellular telephone . The Node Bs , RNC  and other components may form the RAN , as is known in the art. However, alternate configurations may also be used and the invention is not limited to the configuration illustrated. For example, in another embodiment the functionality of the RNC  and one or more of the Node Bs  may be collapsed into a single \u201chybrid\u201d module having the functionality of both the RNC  and the Node B(s) .",{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0034","num":"0033"},"figref":["FIG. 2A","FIG. 2A","FIG. 2A"],"b":["126","126","160","165","175","175"]},"Generally, GPRS is a protocol used by Global System for Mobile communications (GSM) phones for transmitting Internet Protocol (IP) packets. The GPRS Core Network (e.g., the GGSN  and one or more SGSNs ) is the centralized part of the GPRS system and also provides support for W-CDMA based 3G networks. The GPRS core network is an integrated part of the GSM core network, provides mobility management, session management and transport for IP packet services in GSM and W-CDMA networks.","The GPRS Tunneling Protocol (GTP) is the defining IP protocol of the GPRS core network. The GTP is the protocol which allows end users (e.g., access terminals) of a GSM or W-CDMA network to move from place to place while continuing to connect to the internet as if from one location at the GGSN . This is achieved transferring the subscriber's data from the subscriber's current SGSN  to the GGSN , which is handling the subscriber's session.","Three forms of GTP are used by the GPRS core network; namely, (i) GTP-U, (ii) GTP-C and (iii) GTP\u2032 (GTP Prime). GTP-U is used for transfer of user data in separated tunnels for each packet data protocol (PDP) context. GTP-C is used for control signaling (e.g., setup and deletion of PDP contexts, verification of GSN reach-ability, updates or modifications such as when a subscriber moves from one SGSN to another, etc.). GTP\u2032 is used for transfer of charging data from GSNs to a charging function.","Referring to , the GGSN  acts as an interface between the GPRS backbone network (not shown) and the external packet data network . The GGSN  extracts the packet data with associated packet data protocol (PDP) format (e.g., IP or PPP) from the GPRS packets coming from the SGSN , and sends the packets out on a corresponding packet data network. In the other direction, the incoming data packets are directed by the GGSN  to the SGSN  which manages and controls the Radio Access Bearer (RAB) of the destination UE served by the RAN . Thereby, the GGSN  stores the current SGSN address of the target UE and his\/her profile in its location register (e.g., within a PDP context). The GGSN is responsible for IP address assignment and is the default router for the connected UE. The GGSN also performs authentication and charging functions.","The SGSN  is representative of one of many SGSNs within the core network , in an example. Each SGSN is responsible for the delivery of data packets from and to the UEs within an associated geographical service area. The tasks of the SGSN  includes packet routing and transfer, mobility management (e.g., attach\/detach and location management), logical link management, and authentication and charging functions. The location register of the SGSN stores location information (e.g., current cell, current VLR) and user profiles (e.g., IMSI, PDP address(es) used in the packet data network) of all GPRS users registered with the SGSN , for example, within one or more PDP contexts for each user or UE. Thus, SGSNs are responsible for (i) de-tunneling downlink GTP packets from the GGSN , (ii) uplink tunnel IP packets toward the GGSN , (iii) carrying out mobility management as UEs move between SGSN service areas and (iv) billing mobile subscribers. As will be appreciated by one of ordinary skill in the art, aside from (i)-(iv), SGSNs configured for GSM\/EDGE networks have slightly different functionality as compared to SGSNs configured for W-CDMA networks.","The RAN  (e.g., or UTRAN, in Universal Mobile Telecommunications System (UMTS) system architecture) communicates with the SGSN  via a Iu interface, with a transmission protocol such as Frame Relay or IP. The SGSN  communicates with the GGSN  via a Gn interface, which is an IP-based interface between SGSN  and other SGSNs (not shown) and internal GGSNs, and uses the GTP protocol defined above (e.g., GTP-U, GTP-C, GTP\u2032, etc.). While not shown in , the Gn interface is also used by the Domain Name System (DNS). The GGSN  is connected to a Public Data Network (PDN) (not shown), and in turn to the Internet , via a Gi interface with IP protocols either directly or through a Wireless Application Protocol (WAP) gateway.","The PDP context is a data structure present on both the SGSN  and the GGSN  which contains a particular UE's communication session information when the UE has an active GPRS session. When a UE wishes to initiate a GPRS communication session, the UE must first attach to the SGSN  and then activate a PDP context with the GGSN . This allocates a PDP context data structure in the SGSN  that the subscriber is currently visiting and the GGSN  serving the UE's access point.",{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0042","num":"0041"},"figref":["FIG. 2B","FIG. 1","FIG. 2B","FIG. 2B","FIG. 2B"],"b":["100","1","120","1","3","120","162","162","188","175","182","184","186","170","2","5","120","164","162","164","188","175","182","184","186","170","4","175","175"]},"Referring to , UEs ,  and  . . . N are illustrated as wireless cell-phones, UE  is illustrated as a wireless tablet-PC and UE  is illustrated as a wired desktop station. However, in other embodiments, it will be appreciated that the wireless communication system  can connect to any type of UE, and the examples illustrated in  are not intended to limit the types of UEs that may be implemented within the system. Also, while the AAA server , the provisioning server , the IMS\/SIP registration server  and the application server  are each illustrated as structurally separate servers, one or more of these servers may be consolidated in at least one embodiment of the invention.","Further, referring to , the application server  is illustrated as including a plurality of media control complexes (MCCs)  . . . N B, and a plurality of regional dispatchers  . . . N A. Collectively, the regional dispatchers A and MCCs B are included within the application server , which in at least one embodiment can correspond to a distributed network of servers that collectively functions to arbitrate communication sessions (e.g., half-duplex group communication sessions via IP unicasting and\/or IP multicasting protocols) within the wireless communication system . For example, because the communication sessions arbitrated by the application server  can theoretically take place between UEs located anywhere within the system , multiple regional dispatchers A and MCCs are distributed to reduce latency for the arbitrated communication sessions (e.g., so that a MCC in North America is not relaying media back-and-forth between session participants located in China). Thus, when reference is made to the application server , it will be appreciated that the associated functionality can be enforced by one or more of the regional dispatchers A and\/or one or more of the MCCs B. The regional dispatchers A are generally responsible for any functionality related to establishing a communication session (e.g., handling signaling messages between the UEs, scheduling and\/or sending announce messages, etc.), whereas the MCCs B are responsible for hosting the communication session for the duration of the call instance, including conducting an in-call signaling and an actual exchange of media during an arbitrated communication session.","Referring to , a UE , (here a wireless device), such as a cellular telephone, has a platform  that can receive and execute software applications, data and\/or commands transmitted from the RAN  that may ultimately come from the core network , the Internet and\/or other remote servers and networks. The platform  can include a transceiver  operably coupled to an application specific integrated circuit (ASIC) , or other processor, microprocessor, logic circuit, or other data processing device. The ASIC  or other processor executes the application programming interface (API)  layer that interfaces with any resident programs in the memory  of the wireless device. The memory  can be comprised of read-only or random-access memory (RAM and ROM), EEPROM, flash cards, or any memory common to computer platforms. The platform  also can include a local database  that can hold applications not actively used in memory . The local database  is typically a flash memory cell, but can be any secondary storage device as known in the art, such as magnetic media, EEPROM, optical media, tape, soft or hard disk, or the like. The internal platform  components can also be operably coupled to external devices such as antenna , display , push-to-talk button  and keypad  among other components, as is known in the art.","Accordingly, an embodiment of the invention can include a UE with the ability to perform the functions described herein. As will be appreciated by those skilled in the art, the various logic elements can be embodied in discrete elements, software modules executed on a processor or any combination of software and hardware to achieve the functionality disclosed herein. For example, ASIC , memory , API  and local database  may all be used cooperatively to load, store and execute the various functions disclosed herein and thus the logic to perform these functions may be distributed over various elements. Alternatively, the functionality could be incorporated into one discrete component. Therefore, the features of the UE  in  are to be considered merely illustrative and the invention is not limited to the illustrated features or arrangement.","The wireless communication between the UE  or  and the RAN  can be based on different technologies, such as code division multiple access (CDMA), W-CDMA, time division multiple access (TDMA), frequency division multiple access (FDMA), Orthogonal Frequency Division Multiplexing (OFDM), the Global System for Mobile Communications (GSM), or other protocols that may be used in a wireless communications network or a data communications network. For example, in W-CDMA, the data communication is typically between the client device , Node B(s) , and the RNC . The RNC  can be connected to multiple data networks such as the core network , PSTN, the Internet, a virtual private network, a SGSN, a GGSN and the like, thus allowing the UE  or  access to a broader communication network. As discussed in the foregoing and known in the art, voice transmission and\/or data can be transmitted to the UEs from the RAN using a variety of networks and configurations. Accordingly, the illustrations provided herein are not intended to limit the embodiments of the invention and are merely to aid in the description of aspects of embodiments of the invention.",{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0048","num":"0047"},"figref":["FIG. 3B","FIG. 3B"],"b":["200","200","300","305","310","315"]},"Referring to , the multimedia client B corresponds to a client that executes on the UE  to support communication sessions (e.g., VoIP sessions, PTT sessions, PTX sessions, etc.) that are arbitrated by the application server  over the RAN , whereby the RAN  described above with respect to  forms part of a WWAN. The multimedia WLAN arbitration client B of  corresponds to a module that works in conjunction with the multimedia client B for supporting the multimedia client's B communication sessions over a personal area network (PAN) and\/or WLAN. The multimedia client B and multimedia WLAN arbitration client B can either correspond to different portions of the same client-executable software module or alternatively to separate client-executable software modules.","Further, the multimedia WLAN arbitration client B is capable of operating in different \u2018modes\u2019. For example, the multimedia WLAN arbitration client B can operate in client-only mode, whereby the UE  can participate with other local UEs in a group communication session via a PAN as will be described below in more detail. Alternatively, the multimedia WLAN arbitration client B can operate as an arbitrator or in arbitration-mode. As will be described in greater detail below, at least a portion of the arbitration functions associated with the UE 's communication sessions are supported by the multimedia WLAN arbitration client B when operating as arbitrator. In particular, arbitration functions for other UEs in a PAN of the UE  that are also participating (or attempting to participate) in a particular communication session are supported by the multimedia WLAN arbitration client B when acting in arbitration-mode. Also, UEs operating in client-only mode will generally communicate within the PAN and not the WWAN, whereas UEs operating in arbitration mode can, in at least one embodiment, be a point of contact for the PAN by the application server . Thus, when the application server  wants to modify a parameter associated with the PAN, the application server  contacts the arbitrator instead of contacting each PAN-participant individually.","Referring to , the WWAN radio and modem B corresponds to hardware of the UE  that is used to establish a wireless communication link with the RAN , such as a wireless base station or cellular tower. In an example, when the UE  can establish a good connection with the application server , the application server  can be relied upon to fully arbitrate the UE 's communication sessions such that the multimedia client B can interact with the WWAN radio modem B (to connect to the application server  via the RAN ) to engage in the communication session.","The WLAN radio and modem B corresponds to hardware of the UE  that is used to establish a wireless communication link directly with other local UEs to form a PAN (e.g., via Bluetooth, WiFi, etc.), or alternatively connect to other local UEs via a local access point (AP) (e.g., a WLAN AP or router, a WiFi hotspot, etc.). In an example, when the UE  cannot establish an acceptable connection with the application server  (e.g., due to a poor physical-layer and\/or backhaul connection), the application server  cannot be relied upon to fully arbitrate the UE 's communication sessions. In this case, the multimedia client B can invoke or trigger the multimedia WLAN arbitration client B in an attempt to support a given communication session (at least partially) via a PAN using WLAN protocols (e.g., either in client-only or arbitration-mode).",{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0053","num":"0052"},"figref":["FIG. 4","FIG. 4"],"b":["400","124","124","120","400","124","400","124","1","405","400","1","2","410","400","1","405","1","2","410"]},"As will be appreciated by one of ordinary skill in the art, it can be difficult for UEs to establish connections via a WWAN when a high number of UEs are concurrently attempting to access the WWAN. For example, in a disaster-type scenario (e.g., an earthquake, a terrorist attack, etc.), a high number of UEs in proximity to the disaster (e.g., in a serving area of the disaster, such as a sector, cluster of sectors or subnet) will be expected to make phone calls or exchange other types of media with a local Node B, which can potentially overload the system. This in turn makes it difficult for emergency personnel to connect to the local Node B and\/or for a dispatcher to contact the emergency personnel near the disaster area. Conventionally, attempts to mitigate the resource scarcity issue for emergency or high-priority personnel in disaster areas is to reserve a given level of resources (e.g., MAC IDs, QoS resources, etc.) for the exclusive use of the high-priority personnel and\/or to preempt resources already allocated to low-priority users for re-allocation to the high-priority personnel. However, this reduces the resources that are made available to lower-priority users, which degrades the user experience.","Embodiments of the invention are directed to partially or fully transitioning responsibilities for arbitrating a group communication session from the application server  to one or more UEs that are attempting to participate in the group communication session. At least a portion of the media exchanged during the group communication session can then be conveyed between UEs via one or more local wireless connections, or PANs.  are directed to a scenario where one or more of the UEs attempting to participate in the group communication session can access the WWAN and the application server . However, to conserve WWAN resources, the support-level of the group communication session by the application server  is reduced and at least one UE participating in the group communication session will support a partial or full arbitration-function for the group communication session.  are directed to a scenario where the UEs attempting to participate in the group communication session cannot access the WWAN and\/or the application server , and instead rely upon self-arbitration of the group communication session exclusively via a local wireless connection or PAN.","Referring to , UE  determines to initiate a group communication session to be arbitrated by the application server  over the WWAN, A. UE  then determines its location in A. In the embodiment of , it may be assumed that the degree of accuracy to which the location of UE  is determined is sufficient to be compared against the reported locations of other UEs so that the application server  can determine whether a PAN including the respective UEs is capable of being set-up. For example, the location-determination of A can be based on a global positioning system (GPS) procedure, in an example. In the embodiment of , it may further be assumed that UE  is capable of supporting the group communication session over a PAN via WLAN protocols, for example, based on UE  including the multimedia WLAN arbitration client B and the WLAN radio and modem B as shown in .","Accordingly, UE  transmits a group call request message to the RAN , which forwards the group call request message to the application server , A. The group call request of A is configured to indicate the location of the UE  as determined in A, and is further configured to indicate to the application server  that UE  is PAN-capable. Alternatively, UE 's PAN-capabilities may already be known by the application server  (e.g., set-up during a previous registration procedure) such that the group call request message need not include a PAN-capable indication. The application server  receives the group call request from UE , identifies UEs  . . . N as the target UEs for the group communication session and then sends a call announcement message to the RAN  for transmission to UEs  . . . N, A.","In the embodiment of , assume that UEs  . . . N each receive the call announcement message and determine to join the announced group communication session. In the embodiment of , it may further be assumed that UEs  . . . N are each capable of supporting the group communication session over a PAN via WLAN protocols, for example, based on UEs  . . . N each including the multimedia WLAN arbitration client B and the WLAN radio and modem B as shown in . Accordingly, UEs  . . . N each determine their respective locations, A and A. For example, in A and A, it may be assumed that the degree of accuracy to which the location of UEs  . . . N is determined is sufficient to be compared against the reported locations of other UEs so that the application server  can determine whether a PAN including the respective UEs is capable of being set-up, as in A. After determining their respective locations, UEs  . . . N each transmit a call acceptance message to the application server , A and A. The call acceptance messages of A and A are configured to indicate the locations of the UEs  . . . N as determined in A and A, respectively, and are further configured to indicate to the application server  that UEs  . . . N are PAN-capable. Alternatively, the PAN-capabilities of UEs  . . . N may already be known by the application server  (e.g., set-up during a previous registration procedure) such that the call acceptance messages of A and A not include a PAN-capable indication.","After receiving a threshold number of ACKs to the call announcement message from the target UEs that indicate acceptance of the announced group communication session, the application server  determines whether the responsive UEs (e.g., UEs  . . . N) are in close proximity to UE  in A. In particular, the application server  determines the geographic area or region occupied by UEs  . . . N in order to determine whether a PAN can be used to support the group communication session between UEs  . . . N. As shown in , UEs  . . . N are positioned within the first region A, which is assumed to be sufficiently close (e.g., a few hundred meters) for a PAN-supported call via WLAN protocols. Accordingly, the application server  determines that the proximity of UEs  . . . N to UE  to be sufficient to transition the group communication session from a WWAN-supported call to a PAN-supported call in A. The application server  sends messages to UEs  . . . N to facilitate UEs  . . . N to transition to a PAN-supported group communication session with UE  being the designated arbitrator, A, A and A. In the embodiment of , UE  is described as being the arbitrator for the PAN-supported group communication session based on UE 's status as originator for the session. However, in another embodiment, the application server  may instead designate a UE that is geographically central to the PAN as the arbitrator so that the arbitrator is in a good position to relay messages to the other UEs in the session.","The process of  continues in , whereby UEs  . . . N receive PAN-transition messages from the application server  and then load the multimedia WLAN arbitration client B for participating in the group communication session in the PAN via the WLAN protocols, A, A and A. As will be appreciated, UEs  . . . N are set-up to operate in client-only mode whereas UE  is set-up to operate as the arbitrator or in arbitration-mode. After loading the multimedia WLAN arbitration client B in A and A, UEs  . . . N negotiate with UE  to establish their WLAN contact information for the group communication session, A, A. Likewise, UE  sends its own WLAN contact information to UEs  . . . N, A and A.","After setting-up the WLAN contact information among UEs  . . . N, UE  starts the group communication session as the initial floor-holder and begins transmitting media to UEs  . . . N via WLAN protocols, A. As will be appreciated, the WWAN is bypassed and the media being exchanged in A corresponds to local WLAN (e.g., 802.11 or WiFi) traffic that is exchanged within the first region A between UEs  . . . N. Also, the media exchanged in A can be directly conveyed from UE  to UEs  . . . N without the use of a WLAN router or AP in an example. UEs  . . . N receive the media from UE  and playback the received media via respective audio output devices to their users, A and A.","At some later point in time, assume that the user of UE  indicates a desire to speak to the communication group. For example, if the group communication session corresponds to a half-duplex PTT call, the indication can correspond to the user of UE  pushing a PTT button thereon.

For example, data, instructions, commands, information, signals, bits, symbols, and chips that may be referenced throughout the above description may be represented by voltages, currents, electromagnetic waves, magnetic fields or particles, optical fields or particles, or any combination thereof.","Further, those of skill in the art will appreciate that the various illustrative logical blocks, modules, circuits, and algorithm steps described in connection with the embodiments disclosed herein may be implemented as electronic hardware, computer software, or combinations of both. To clearly illustrate this interchangeability of hardware and software, various illustrative components, blocks, modules, circuits, and steps have been described above generally in terms of their functionality. Whether such functionality is implemented as hardware or software depends upon the particular application and design constraints imposed on the overall system. Skilled artisans may implement the described functionality in varying ways for each particular application, but such implementation decisions should not be interpreted as causing a departure from the scope of the present invention.","The various illustrative logical blocks, modules, and circuits described in connection with the embodiments disclosed herein may be implemented or performed with a general purpose processor, a digital signal processor (DSP), an application specific integrated circuit (ASIC), a field programmable gate array (FPGA) or other programmable logic device, discrete gate or transistor logic, discrete hardware components, or any combination thereof designed to perform the functions described herein. A general purpose processor may be a microprocessor, but in the alternative, the processor may be any conventional processor, controller, microcontroller, or state machine. A processor may also be implemented as a combination of computing devices, e.g., a combination of a DSP and a microprocessor, a plurality of microprocessors, one or more microprocessors in conjunction with a DSP core, or any other such configuration.","The methods, sequences and\/or algorithms described in connection with the embodiments disclosed herein may be embodied directly in hardware, in a software module executed by a processor, or in a combination of the two. A software module may reside in RAM memory, flash memory, ROM memory, EPROM memory, EEPROM memory, registers, hard disk, a removable disk, a CD-ROM, or any other form of storage medium known in the art. An exemplary storage medium is coupled to the processor such that the processor can read information from, and write information to, the storage medium. In the alternative, the storage medium may be integral to the processor. The processor and the storage medium may reside in an ASIC. The ASIC may reside in a user terminal (e.g., access terminal). In the alternative, the processor and the storage medium may reside as discrete components in a user terminal.","In one or more exemplary embodiments, the functions described may be implemented in hardware, software, firmware, or any combination thereof. If implemented in software, the functions may be stored on or transmitted over as one or more instructions or code on a computer-readable medium. Computer-readable media includes both computer storage media and communication media including any medium that facilitates transfer of a computer program from one place to another. A storage media may be any available media that can be accessed by a computer. By way of example, and not limitation, such computer-readable media can comprise RAM, ROM, EEPROM, CD-ROM or other optical disk storage, magnetic disk storage or other magnetic storage devices, or any other medium that can be used to carry or store desired program code in the form of instructions or data structures and that can be accessed by a computer. Also, any connection is properly termed a computer-readable medium. For example, if the software is transmitted from a website, server, or other remote source using a coaxial cable, fiber optic cable, twisted pair, digital subscriber line (DSL), or wireless technologies such as infrared, radio, and microwave, then the coaxial cable, fiber optic cable, twisted pair, DSL, or wireless technologies such as infrared, radio, and microwave are included in the definition of medium. Disk and disc, as used herein, includes compact disc (CD), laser disc, optical disc, digital versatile disc (DVD), floppy disk and blu-ray disc where disks usually reproduce data magnetically, while discs reproduce data optically with lasers. Combinations of the above should also be included within the scope of computer-readable media.","While the foregoing disclosure shows illustrative embodiments of the invention, it should be noted that various changes and modifications could be made herein without departing from the scope of the invention as defined by the appended claims. The functions, steps and\/or actions of the method claims in accordance with the embodiments of the invention described herein need not be performed in any particular order. Furthermore, although elements of the invention may be described or claimed in the singular, the plural is contemplated unless limitation to the singular is explicitly stated."],"brief-description-of-drawings":[{},{}],"description-of-drawings":{"heading":"BRIEF DESCRIPTION OF THE DRAWINGS","p":["A more complete appreciation of embodiments of the invention and many of the attendant advantages thereof will be readily obtained as the same becomes better understood by reference to the following detailed description when considered in connection with the accompanying drawings which are presented solely for illustration and not limitation of the invention, and in which:",{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0011","num":"0010"},"figref":"FIG. 1"},{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0012","num":"0011"},"figref":["FIG. 2A","FIG. 1"]},{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0013","num":"0012"},"figref":["FIG. 2B","FIG. 1"]},{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0014","num":"0013"},"figref":"FIG. 3A"},{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0015","num":"0014"},"figref":["FIG. 3B","FIG. 3A"]},{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0016","num":"0015"},"figref":"FIG. 4"},{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0017","num":"0016"},"figref":"FIGS. 5A and 5B"},{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0018","num":"0017"},"figref":"FIGS. 5C and 5D"},{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0019","num":"0018"},"figref":["FIG. 6A","FIG. 5B","FIG. 5D"]},{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0020","num":"0019"},"figref":"FIGS. 6B and 6C"},{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0021","num":"0020"},"figref":["FIG. 7","FIG. 6C"]},{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0022","num":"0021"},"figref":["FIG. 8","FIGS. 5A through 7"]},{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0023","num":"0022"},"figref":"FIG. 9A"},{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0024","num":"0023"},"figref":"FIGS. 9B and 9C"},{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0025","num":"0024"},"figref":["FIG. 10","FIG. 9A","FIG. 9B","FIG. 9C"]}]},"DETDESC":[{},{}]}
