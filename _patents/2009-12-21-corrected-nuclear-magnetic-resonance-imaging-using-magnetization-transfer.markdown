title: Corrected nuclear magnetic resonance imaging using magnetization transfer
abstract: Techniques for corrected nuclear magnetic resonance (NMR) data include applying a presaturation radio frequency (RF) magnetic field different from a fat molecule resonance for a particular time to a target tissue; and applying a first measurement RF magnetic field within a first time after the particular time. Correction nuclear magnetic resonance (NMR) data from the target tissue is determined based on first NMR data received in response to applying the first measurement RF magnetic field. In some embodiments, a second measurement RF magnetic field is also applied in a second time different from both the particular time and the first time. Corrected NMR data is determined by subtracting the correction NMR data from second NMR data received in response to applying the second measurement RF magnetic field. Among other applications, these techniques allow distinguishing either fat or proteins in edemas, or both, from proteins in other tissues.

The Government has certain rights in the invention.","1. Field of the Invention","The present invention relates to magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) and magnetic resonance spectral imaging (MRSI).","2. Description of the Related Art","Suppression of nuclear magnetic resonance (NMR) signals from fat molecules in a human or animal subject is useful in discerning and interpreting structures in MRI and MRSI imagery of the subject. Several techniques for suppression of the signals from fat have been employed in the prior art, and have been found useful in the medical arts.","However, each of these techniques suffer one or more deficiencies, such as failing to completely eliminate the signals from fat molecules or requiring a precisely known or homogeneous steady state magnetic field (B0) or radio-frequency field (B), or some combination.","Techniques are provided for generating nuclear magnetic resonance signals that display corrected structure in a target tissue without all the deficiencies of prior art approaches to remove signals from fat molecules.","In one set of embodiments a method includes applying a presaturation radio frequency (RF) magnetic field at a particular frequency different from a fat molecule resonance for a particular time to a target tissue. The method also includes applying a first measurement RF magnetic field within a first time after the particular time. Correction nuclear magnetic resonance data from the target tissue is determined based on first nuclear magnetic resonance data received in response to applying the first measurement RF magnetic field.","In some of these embodiments, the method further includes applying a second measurement RF magnetic field in a second time different from both the particular time and the first time. Corrected nuclear magnetic resonance data is determined by subtracting the correction nuclear magnetic resonance data from second nuclear magnetic resonance data received in response to applying the second measurement RF magnetic field.","In other sets of embodiments an apparatus or computer readable storage medium is configured to perform one or more steps of the above method.","Techniques are described for generating nuclear magnetic resonance data that display corrected structure in a target tissue. In the following description, for the purposes of explanation, numerous specific details are set forth in order to provide a thorough understanding of the present invention. It will be apparent, however, to one skilled in the art that the present invention may be practiced without these specific details. In other instances, well-known structures and devices are shown in block diagram form in order to avoid unnecessarily obscuring the present invention.","Some embodiments of the invention are described below in the context of imagery of proteins and membrane phospholipids. However, the invention is not limited to this context. In other embodiments other molecules are contrasted from fat molecules or other tissue components in NMR images of a target tissue. In some embodiments, the target tissue is a sample removed from a living organism, but in some embodiments, the target tissue is all or part of the living organism, such as a human or animal.","Nuclear magnetic resonance (NMR) studies magnetic nuclei by aligning them with an applied constant magnetic field (B) and perturbing this alignment using an alternating magnetic field (B), orthogonal to the constant magnetic field. The resulting response to the perturbing magnetic field is the phenomenon that is exploited in magnetic resonance spectroscopy (MRS) and magnetic resonance imaging (MRI).","The elementary particles, neutrons and protons, composing an atomic nucleus, have the intrinsic quantum mechanical property of spin. The overall spin of the nucleus is determined by the spin quantum number I. If the number of both the protons and neutrons in a given isotope are even, then I=0. In other cases, however, the overall spin is non-zero. A non-zero spin is associated with a non-zero magnetic moment, \u03bc, as given by Equation 1a.\n\n\u03bc=\u03b3\u2003\u2003(1a)\n\nwhere the proportionality constant, \u03b3, is the gyromagnetic ratio. It is this magnetic moment that is exploited in NMR. For example, nuclei that have a spin of one-half, like Hydrogen nuclei (H), a single proton, have two possible spin states (also referred to as up and down, respectively). The energies of these states are the same. Hence the populations of the two states (i.e. number of atoms in the two states) will be approximately equal at thermal equilibrium. If a nucleus is placed in a magnetic field, however, the interaction between the nuclear magnetic moment and the external magnetic field means the two states no longer have the same energy. The energy difference between the two states is given by Equation 1b.\n\n\u0394\u2003\u2003(1b)\n\nwhere  is Planck's reduced constant. Resonant absorption will occur when electromagnetic radiation of the correct frequency to match this energy difference is applied. The energy of photons of electromagnetic radiation is given by Equation 2.\n\n\u2003\u2003(2)\n\nwhere f is the frequency of the electromagnetic radiation and h=2\u03c0. Thus, absorption will occur when the frequency is given by Equation 3.\n\n\/(2\u03c0)\u2003\u2003(3)\n\nThe NMR frequency f is shifted by the \u2018shielding\u2019 effect of the surrounding electrons. In general, this electronic shielding reduces the magnetic field at the nucleus (which is what determines the NMR frequency). As a result, the energy gap is reduced, and the frequency required to achieve resonance is also reduced. This shift of the NMR frequency due to the chemical environment is called the chemical shift, and it explains why NMR is a direct probe of chemical structure. The chemical shift in absolute terms is defined by the frequency of the resonance expressed with reference to a standard which is defined to be at 0. The scale is made more manageable by expressing it in parts per million (ppm) of the standard frequency.\n","Applying a short electromagnetic pulse in the radio frequency (RF) range to a set of nuclear spins simultaneously excites all the NMR transitions. In terms of the net magnetization vector, this corresponds to tilting the magnetization vector away from its equilibrium position (aligned along the external magnetic field, B). The out-of-equilibrium magnetization vector precesses about the external magnetic field at the NMR frequency of the spins. This oscillating magnetization induces a current in a nearby pickup coil acting as a radio frequency (RF) receiver, creating an electrical signal oscillating at the NMR frequency. A portion of this time domain signal (intensity vs. time) is known as the free induction decay (FID) and contains the sum of the NMR responses from all the excited spins. In order to obtain the frequency-domain NMR spectrum (intensity vs. frequency) for magnetic resonance spectroscopy (MRS) and MRS imaging (MRSI), this time-domain signal is Fourier transformed to a frequency domain signal.","A typical NMR measurement does not substantially alter the system under study. The nuclear spins, once promoted to the higher energy level, quickly return to the lower energy level by some route. This process of returning to the pre-experiment condition is called relaxation. If the relaxation is quick, the peak areas reflect the number of contributing nuclei. If the relaxation is slow or the signal strength great enough and persistent enough, nuclei are promoted to the higher energy spin state faster than they can leave it. Eventually the population excess of the lower energy level will be depleted and the two populations will become the same. This is called saturation. As the system begins to saturate, the NMR signal will diminish in intensity and at full saturation will disappear.","Magnetization transfer (MT) refers to the transfer or exchange of longitudinal magnetization between free water protons and protons of tissue protein, membrane phospholipids and any non-mobile molecules that retain their alignment with respect to the applied magnetic fields.","The inventors recognized that MT from water to protons in molecules of structural interest in a tissue sample, such as proteins and membrane lipids, and MT from fats to these same protons, are different; and provide an opportunity to remove the fat signal from NMR measurements. The inventors' approach, furthermore, does not suffer one or more of the disadvantages of prior art approaches, as explained in more detail below.","According to example embodiments described in more detail below, saturation of the protons in molecules of interest with which water has a high MT but fat has a low MT can be used to produce signals that allow the removal of fat signals in NMR data. Since the saturation occurs before making an NMR measurement, this kind of saturation is called presaturation, herein.","The NMR signal from fat distorts measurements of NMR signals from tissues encompassed by fat or nearby, such as tissues in the liver, skin and bone marrow, as described in more detail in a later section. Other approaches to removing the fat signal are incomplete or rely on precise knowledge of the magnetic fields that is often not available.",{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0039","num":"0038"},"figref":["FIG. 1","FIG. 1"],"b":["100","100","102","180","190","190","100"]},"The scanning apparatus  includes a Bmagnet , an x-gradient magnet , a y-gradient magnet , a z-gradient magnet , a group of shim coils (e.g., shim coils and ), a radio frequency (RF) transmitter , an RF receiver , a communications interface , and a processor\/internal controller .

A major source of contamination of signals from proteins is shielding from protons in fat molecules, which is especially problematic in fatty tissues, such as liver, myelin sheaths, and skin, among many others.  is a graph  that depicts the NMR spectrum  of human fat tissue (comprising triglyceride).

Peaks ,  and  are not shown in . Peak  is from water in the tissue. Peak  is the residual water in DO in a capillary tube that was placed parallel to a tissue sample tube. Peak  is from a glycerol proton of the middle triglyceride chain (not shown ). The water signal (peak  and a small fairly broad peak under peak ) from the sample was very small compared to the strong fat signals. The major methylene peak (peak ) accounted for 59% of all fat signals in this sample. The vinyl signal (peak ) intensity was approximately 11% of the intensity of peak .",{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0045","num":"0044"},"figref":"FIG. 2C","b":["230","230","232","234","230","240","250"],"sup":["\u22123 ","\u22122 ","\u22123 ","6 "]},"The broad separation of fat resonance peaks results in a chemical shift artifact, in which the signals originating from low resonance peaks are misregistered in an image (e.g., image ) with respect to signals from high resonance peaks. At high field strength, the resonance frequencies of the different fat signals show increased separation, which can further intensify this chemical shift problem. Thus, in , which is an image generated at high field strength (14 T) and with a small field of view, it is not surprising that the various fat signals were misregistered, resulting in two sub-images. Left sub-image  came from resonance peaks , , , and  of fat. The small tissue water signal (resonance peak ) also contributed slightly to this sub-image . The right sub-image  came from resonance peaks , , , , , and , with the majority of signal generated from the methylene peak . The intensity of the left sub-image  is approximately 8.5% that of the right sub-image . The 1.1 mm separation of the two images is consistent with the 2419 Hz (about 4.03 ppm) distance between vinyl peak  and methylene peak  in the spectrum at 600 MHz field and with the imaging parameters (applied reading gradient of 1.1 Gauss\/cm; acquisition sampling rate 40,000 Hertz). In addition, the spread of the fat resonance peaks , , , , and  around peak  generated extended edges on both sides of the right sub-image (see the areas and in the dashed rectangles on either edge of the right sub-image ), as evidenced by the shape of right sub-image  being elliptical rather than circular. If prior art fat suppression techniques were applied to remove the signal from peak , both sub-images would persist, as would the extended edges around the right sub-image.","In general, fat signals can compromise MRI quality by overwhelming the water images in fat-abundant regions. A strong fat signal can also impede the precision of tumor detection by inducing chemical shift artifacts and by obscuring the effects of MRI relaxation agents, which interact only with water. Therefore, fat-suppression and water- or fat-selective imaging have been used in many routine clinical examinations to reduce artifacts and to improve tissue characterization. Prior experimental techniques to achieve these goals include direct presaturation on the large fat methylene peak , selective suppression of fat based on the T1 relaxation time difference between water and fat signal, selective excitation of water using selective pulses, and the \u2018Dixon Method\u2019, which works with phase shifts. These methods can be very sensitive to the heterogeneity of the static field Band\/or the radiofrequency (RF) field B. Furthermore, the majority of these schemes consider fat to have only a single resonance or assume that all the fat signals have a uniform relaxation time. In reality, fat triglyceride comprises 10 resonance peaks (enumerated peaks -,  and  in ) that are spread over a chemical shift range of more than 4.4 ppm from the vinyl peak () to the methyl peak (). The strongest peak is the methylene peak  on the triglyceride fatty acid chains, excluding those methylene groups that are one bond away from the vinyl group and those one or two bonds away from the carbonyl group. This large methylene peak  accounts for approximately 60% of all the fat signals. The remaining 40% of fat signals have been ignored in most fat-suppression techniques; this can induce residual image artifacts and compromise image interpretation. The problem is typically more pronounced at higher magnetic field strengths.",{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0048","num":"0047"},"figref":["FIG. 3","FIG. 3"],"b":["310","320","330","320","310","320","330","310","330"],"i":["a","a","a ","a ","a","a ","a","a ","a "]},"It was recognized that this MT network provides an opportunity for presaturation of this tissue proton component (to eliminate its NMR signal) while having no effect on the signal from the fat component . The signal from the water content can be partially or fully eliminated due to near saturation of the water component by magnetization transfer from water to the protons of the tissue protein and membrane phospholipid ","On static state NMR analysis, (e.g., NMR imagery omitting spectral information) the resonance peak from protons in tissue protein and membrane phospholipid has a linewidth that reaches about 20,000 Hz. The signal from protons in this tissue component is thus too broad to be seen in a static NMR signal and does not contribute to the static MRI signal. Selective presaturation of the protons in the protein and membrane phospholipid tissue is easy to implement, for example, by using a low-power, long-time irradiation by Bat any frequency along the broad spectral resonance frequency of this tissue proton component , as long as the irradiation is not on proton peaks for water or fat components. As shown below, protons in proteins floating in edemas have a linewidth of about 1,500 Hz from the water peak, and can also be selectively saturated or avoided when saturating the protons in other structural tissues.","The method outlined in  is further described using a simple mathematical model. The signal SA of a regular image A schematized by components , and includes signal Sw from water and signal Sf from fat signals as indicated by expression in  and in Equation 4. The signal of the protons in protein and membrane phospholipid component is negligible in the images and typically detectable primarily in the spectra. Thus to first order\n\n\u2003\u2003(4)\n\nThis image can be acquired using any approach that is best suited to the particular application. Therefore, signals Sw and Sf can be sensitive to water density and fat and water relaxation times.\n","A second image acquired with the tissue protein and membrane phospholipid protons presaturated is depicted by the nearly saturated water component due to MT, the strong signal from the unsaturated fat component and the saturated protons of the tissue proteins and membrane phospholipid . This presaturation does not change any of the fat signals because there is no magnetization transfer from fat to water or to the tissue proton component . Magnetization transfer from water to the tissue protein and membrane phospholipid protons reduces the water signal to \u03b1*Sw, where \u03b1 describes the proportion of the water signal that remains. Consequently, the signal SB acquired in this stage consists of the full fat signal and a portion of the water signal as indicated by expression in  and in Equation 5\n\n\u2003\u2003(5)\n","Factor \u03b1 depends on the efficiency of magnetization transfer between water and the tissue protein and membrane phospholipid protons and is determined mainly by the magnetization transfer rate between water and these tissue protons, the relaxation rates of water and these tissue protons, and the irradiation time and intensity of the pulse used to presaturate the tissue proton component . Factor \u03b1 can be experimentally determined for a specific tissue.","A subtraction of the two images represented by Equation 4 and Equation 5 results in the final image depicted by the nearly unsaturated water component , the eliminated fat component and the negligible unsaturated protons of the tissue proteins and membrane phospholipid . Consequently, the difference signal SC consists of no fat signal and a known portion of the water signal as indicated by expression in  and in Equation 6.\n\n=(1\u2212\u03b1)\u2003\u2003(6)\n\nAll the fat signals are eliminated irrespective of their chemical shift. SC reflects the water protons populations hydrating the target tissues and gives an image that reflects the non-fat components of the tissues.\n","This method is independent of the heterogeneity of the static field Bor RF field B. In the water-only image SC that is proportional to (1\u2212\u03b1) Sw, the magnetization transfer factor (1\u2212\u03b1) provides magnetization transfer contrast in addition to the contrast provided by water density or relaxation time embedded in the image signal Sw.","If the factor \u03b1 is estimated by an independent experiment, an image that consists only of fat signal can be determined from Eq. (4) and Eq. (5) as\n\n\u03b1=(\u03b1\u22121)\u2003\u2003(7)\n","This fat-only image contains signals from all fat resonance peaks. If \u03b1 approaches 0, this calculation is unnecessary; image signal SB is a fat-only image.","The magnetization transfer factor (1\u2212\u03b1) in Equation 6 depends on many factors but can be controlled by adjusting the intensity and length of the presaturation pulse. When the presaturation pulse is strong enough and long enough, values of the parameter (1\u2212\u03b1) are approximately the same for many tissue types and thus do contribute contrast to the fat-free image. However, under standard imaging conditions, the intensity and length of the presaturation pulse is typically very limited resulting in significantly different magnetization transfer rates for different tissue types; and, under these conditions, enable significant magnetization transfer contrast which was not previously detected in a fat-subtracted image.","This approach for fat-suppression completely eliminates all the fat signals irrespective of their chemical shift frequency; and is insensitive to the heterogeneity of RF field Band static field B. This new approach relies solely on the fact that fat protons do not exchange magnetization with water or with protein and cell membrane phospholipids protons in tissue samples. This method extends the classical MRI magnetization transfer technique and generates a fat-free image that is sensitive to magnetization transfer as well as the tissue water density and relaxation time.",{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0060","num":"0059"},"figref":"FIG. 4"},"In step , protons in certain molecules are presaturated. The certain protons are not in water or fat molecules, as described in more detail above. In some embodiments the certain protons are in molecules that have a high MT rate with water but a low MT rate with fat molecules, as described above. For example, in an illustrated embodiment, the protons are in proteins or membrane phospholipid molecules. Any known or novel method may be used to presaturate such molecules. For example, in some embodiments protons are saturated using a frequency at about 8.3 ppm (about 4980 Hz) for 5 seconds.","In step , a first NMR measurement is made using any technique appropriate for the features of interest. The measurement can be of water intensity, phase difference, relaxation time difference or spectral power in one or more frequency bins, among others. The first measurement is made, however, within a first time while the certain protons are still saturated.","In step , the same type or similar type of NMR measurement is made. This second measurement is made, however, within a second time while the certain protons are not saturated. For example, this second measurement is made before presaturating the certain protons; or sometime after the saturated protons have relaxed to a higher population in the lower spin energy state.","In step , fat free NMR data (e.g., spectra or imagery of intensity, phase difference, relaxation time difference or MT difference) is determined based on the difference between the first NMR data and the second NMR data. For example, an image based on the first NMR data is subtracted pixel by pixel from an image based on the second NMR data.","In step , the NMR data is presented based on the fat-free NMR data. For example, an MRI or MRSI image or spectrum is presented based on the fat-free NMR data. Some experimental embodiments are described in the next section.","The fat-elimination method described is substantially more efficient at suppressing fat signal than the conventional fat-suppression and water- or fat-selective imaging methods. The major methylene signal at peak  is the focus of most traditional techniques for fat-suppression, water-selective imaging or fat-selective imaging, while the remaining resonance peaks are ignored. For a regular triglyceride molecule including two double bonds in each of the three chains, the major methylene signal constitutes at most 65% of all the fat signals. Any increase in the double bond content of fat will further reduce the ratio of fat methylene peak to total fat signals in the sample. Therefore, traditional fat-suppression techniques that address only the major methylene signal fail to suppress at least 35% of the signal from fat. In addition, presaturation of a fat resonance peak, which is among the most popular fat-suppression methods, will reduce the water signal intensity because saturation of the major methylene signal also partly saturates protein and membrane phospholipid signal, which triggers magnetization transfer from water.","Experiments were carried out on a Bruker Avance 600 MHz NMR spectrometer (Bruker Biospin, Billerica, Mass., USA) and on a 5 mm probe with x, y, and z triple gradients. The samples were surgically resected human fat tissue and well-differentiated liposarcoma tissue. Specimens were obtained with consent of the patients and with Institutional Review Board approval. Each tissue sample was cut into small pieces. The small pieces were then drawn into a capillary tube (inner diameter 1 mm, outer diameter 1.8 mm) by attaching the capillary to a syringe. In aggregate, these small tissue pieces occupied about a 1 cm length of the capillary tube. One end of the capillary was then sealed with a small piece of polytetrafluoroethylene seal tape. A second capillary filled with DO for field-frequency lock was placed parallel with the sample capillary into the 5 mm tube. The samples were maintained at 20\u00b0 C. during experiments.","The fat-suppression method was applied to both spectra and images.

As used herein a septa refers to any wall dividing a cavity or structure into smaller ones.","5.4 Edema Enhancement and Suppression","This same mechanism can be used to enhance and suppress tissue edema even if the edema water signal has the same chemical shift as the tissue water signal. As used herein edema refers to any abnormal accumulation of fluid beneath the skin or in one or more cavities of the body. Compared to tissue, edema contains much less protein and almost no phospholipids. More importantly, edema proteins are in liquid environment and are much more mobile and therefore have a different response to the applied magnetic fields. As a result, protons of edema proteins may still resonate in the range of 0 to 10 ppm, which spreads approximately 1,500 Hz from both sides of a water peak at a field strength of 7 T, while a proton signal of tissue protein and phospholipid can spread about 20,000 Hz due to the large dipolar coupling. Thus, a saturation pulse that is more than 1,500 Hz away from water but within 10,000 Hz can be applied to saturate the tissue proteins and phospholipids but not to affect the protons of the edema proteins. This results in an MT image with reduced tissue water signal due to MT and with full edema water signal. This MT image has an enhanced edema signal. Conversely, edema may be removed and the tissue signal retained by subtracting the MT image from a regular image. The signal from protons in the edema proteins can therefore be suppressed (eliminated with the fat signal) or enhanced (saturated with the protons of the tissue proteins and membrane phospholipid).","Suppression or detection of edema has many useful applications, such as for malignant peripheral nerve sheath tumor (MPNST) or glioma. The following images were acquired on a 7T Bruker scanner with a surface detection coil for the MPNST xenograft and a bird-cage head coil for the mouse glioma. The MPNST xenograft was grown in the upper leg of a mouse and the glioma was induced in the mouse by intracranial injection of transfected DF-1 cells.",{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0082","num":"0081"},"figref":["FIG. 9A","FIG. 9B","FIG. 9C"],"b":["910","920","930"]},{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0083","num":"0082"},"figref":["FIG. 10A","FIG. 10B","FIG. 10C"],"b":["1010","1020","1030"]},"Images  and  and images  and  were acquired with RARE, the latter image  and  with a presaturation pulse of 5 seconds and 5000 Hz away from water. The saturation power for images  and  was zero and for images  and  was approximately 120 Hz.","It is worthy to note that this method can be used to produce an edema-enhanced image such as image  or , as well as an edema-free image such as image  or .","For MPNST xenografts, there was edema around the tumor and a core of fat inside the tumor. In the regular T2-weighted image  acquired with RARE, it was not easy to identify the tumor margin; and edema might be interpreted as an infiltrative tumor. The off-resonance presaturation does not saturate the edema in the MT-RARE image. Thus, in the subtracted images, the edema was completely removed. In the edema-free image, the tumor  is evident; the tumor margin was nicely recognizable and the tumor size can be easily measured. Thus, this edema elimination method would enable more accurate prediction of tumor extent which would be important for surgical planning.","While the edema suppressed image  helps isolate a tumor in MPNST, the edema enhanced image  helps indicate the glioma. In the glioma case, the edema may be read as the tumor in a regular T2-weighted image . Edema  is readily distinguished with significantly enhanced contrast in image  for the tumor bearing mouse, because in image  both the regular tissue and tumor were suppressed.","The correction approach depicted in  offers several advantages. As shown in  of the obese mouse, this method retained 85% of the kidney signal intensity. For most tissues other than fat, magnetization transfer from water to protein and membrane phospholipid protons is very efficient (\u03b1 is very small), and thus in most tissues very little water signal is lost. Furthermore, the elimination of the fat signal does not depend on the chemical shift or the linewidth of the fat signals, and it is not affected by the heterogeneity of static field Bor RF field B. The magnetization exchange method can be utilized for any magnetic field strength, and an increase in magnetic field strength does not require any further modification to the approach. Furthermore, this approach can be combined with other MR imaging techniques. For example, for the optimal imaging of tumors, it is expected that the fat-free imaging method will be incorporated into the standard Fast Spin Echo sequence used for conventional tumor imaging, which involves software modification by the manufacturer.","The approach does involve a 2-fold increase in imaging time, as is typical for other fat-suppression techniques. However, the acquired water-only-image provides additional information, as it is now sensitive to magnetization transfer in addition to the tissue water density or relaxation time. Magnetization transfer imaging is a well-developed methodology and has been found useful in many applications such as magnetic resonance angiography, breast imaging, brain metabolism and multiple sclerosis. The fat-free imaging method presented in this work retains all the advantages of traditional magnetization transfer contrast. It should further enhance contrast for more precise tissue characterization and tumor delineation, particularly for tumors arising in regions of high fat content such as the retroperitoneal space.","Thus, potential applications of MT imaging with saturation of protein protons include, among others: 1] improved detection and delineation of tumors such as liposarcoma; 2] improved prediction of tumor response to therapy; 3] improved detection of breast cancer by more precise and uniform suppression of obscuring signals from surrounding normal fat tissue in the breast; 4] improved accuracy of the extent of edema versus tumor, for example, in brain cancer; 5] improved detection of the extent of an infarction and\/or edema in stroke patients; 6] improved evaluation of the extent of fat content in liver following chemotherapy (which would help select best candidates for liver resection following chemotherapy); 7] enabled non-invasive evaluation of the amount of myelin deposition in neurodegenerative diseases; 8] improved detection of the extent of sarcomas, such as myxofibrosarcoma that can extend as sheets of cells along fascial planes; 9] increased precision in detecting the extent of inflammation in diseases such as arthritis; 10] improved detection of retroperitoneal tumors through suppression of unwanted signals from retroperitoneal fat; and, 11] improved detection of bone marrow abnormalities by suppression of unwanted signals from bone marrow fat. In medicine, an infarction is the process of tissue death (necrosis) caused by blockage of the tissue's blood supply. The supplying artery may be blocked by an obstruction (e.g. an embolus, thrombus, or atherosclerotic plaque), may be mechanically compressed (e.g. tumor, volvulus, or hernia), ruptured by trauma (e.g. atherosclerosis or vasculitides), or vasoconstricted (e.g. cocaine vasoconstriction leading to myocardial infarction). Infarctions are commonly associated with hypertension or atherosclerosis. In atherosclerotic formations a plaque develops under a fibrous cap.","The processes described herein for providing corrected NMR imaging may be advantageously implemented via software, hardware (e.g., general processor, Digital Signal Processing (DSP) chip, an Application Specific Integrated Circuit (ASIC), Field Programmable Gate Arrays (FPGAs), etc.), firmware or a combination thereof.

The set of operations also typically include comparing two or more units of information, shifting positions of units of information, and combining two or more units of information, such as by addition or multiplication or logical operations like OR, exclusive OR (XOR), and AND. Each operation of the set of operations that can be performed by the processor is represented to the processor by information called instructions, such as an operation code of one or more digits.
