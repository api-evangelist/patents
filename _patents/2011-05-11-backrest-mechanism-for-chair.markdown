Therefore, if the backrest is reclined and the upper body is largely leaned back, a lateral casing oriented in the left-right direction in the upper end of the back casing prevents an upper portion of the back plate from bending backward, so that the upper back cannot be supported comfortably.","Furthermore, a certain chair among the chairs disclosed in Patent Literatures as described above is configured such that an intermediate portion of the back frame and the back plate in the up-down direction is folded in a laid-V shape when viewed from the side to provide comfortable support around lumbar by the lumbar support effect. However, the lumbar support effect is reduced in a lower portion of the back plate because almost the entire surface of the back plate surrounded by the back casing is made flexible.","The present invention has been made in view of the above circumstances, and an object thereof is to provide a backrest mechanism for a chair, in which upper and lower portions of a back plate are distinctly separated as a flexible portion and an inflexible portion in order to give a sitting person comfortable support at and around his or her back and lumbar.","According to the present invention, the above object is accomplished by the following aspects.","(1) A backrest includes a pair of left and right side rods, each having a folded portion in a laid-V shape in a side view at a portion for supporting a sitting person around his or her lumbar; and a back plate that connects opposing surfaces of the side rods, wherein an upper portion of the back plate above the folded portions serves as a flexible portion that is elastically deformable in a backward direction and that has smaller rigidity than the left and right side rods, and a lower portion of the back plate below the flexible portion serves as an inflexible portion that has greater rigidity than the flexible portion.","According to the above-described configuration, the back plate is distinctly separated into the upper flexible portion and the lower inflexible portion across the folded portions of the side rods, and the upper flexible portion, which is located above the folded portions of the side rods and which supports the back of a sitting person, is connected to the opposing surfaces of the pair of the left and right side rods that have greater rigidity than the upper flexible portion, unlike a conventional configuration in which the upper end of the flexible portion is surrounded by a back frame. Therefore, when the backrest is reclined, the flexible portion effectively bends backward and provides comfortable back support.","In contrast, the lower portion of the back plate below the flexible portion serves as the inflexible portion with greater rigidity than the flexible portion, and is less likely to bend backward. Therefore, the lumbar support effect is exerted and a sitting person can be supported comfortably around his or her lumbar.","(2) In the above-described aspect (1), a center portion of the inflexible portion in a left-right direction is connected to a backrest support rod that stands upward at a rear of a seat.","According to the above-described configuration, the center portion in the left-right direction of the inflexible portion with large rigidity is connected to the backrest support rod. Therefore, the flexible portion that is not connected to the backrest support rod can more easily bend backward in more upper portions, so that it becomes possible to comfortably support the back.","(3) In the above-described aspect (1) or (2), a plurality of elongated holes elongated in an up-down direction and arranged in up-down and left-right directions are provided in the flexible portion.","According to the above-described configuration, it becomes possible to bend the flexible portion in a backward convex arc shape in a planer view, about the elongated holes that are arranged in the up-down and the left-right directions, so that the flexible portion can fit the back.","(4) In the above-described aspect (1), the flexible portion and the inflexible portion are connected to the opposing surfaces of the left and right side rods such that the flexible portion is located anteriorly relative to the inflexible portion, a lower end of the flexible portion and an upper end of the inflexible portion are continued via a step portion, and a grid-like rib is arranged so as to protrude from a front surface of the inflexible portion and so as to be continued to the step portion.","According to the above-described configuration, the flexible portion is located anteriorly relative to the inflexible portion and the grid-like rib is arranged so as to protrude from the inflexible portion. Therefore, the bending rigidity of the inflexible portion is increased relative to that of the flexible portion and the lumbar support effect is improved, so that it becomes possible to provide comfortable support around the lumbar.","Furthermore, the lower end of the flexible portion and the upper end of the inflexible portion are continued via the step portion, and the upper end of the grid-like rib is continued to the step portion. Therefore, the strength at the boundary between the flexible portion and the inflexible portion of the back plate can hardly be reduced.","(5) In the above-described aspect (4), a front surface plate is attached to the front surface of the inflexible portion across the grid-like rib.","According to the above-described configuration, the grid-like rib can be covered by the front surface plate in a dressed-up manner, and the front surface plate can be reinforced by the grid-like rib provide on the rear surface thereof and can function as the inflexible portion with large rigidity. Therefore, it becomes possible to provide comfortable support by the front surface plate around the lumbar.","According to the present invention, it is possible to provide a backrest mechanism for a chair, in which upper and lower portions of a back plate are distinctly separated as a flexible portion and an inflexible portion in order to give a sitting person comfortable support at and around his or her back and lumbar by the flexible portion and the inflexible portion.","Hereinafter, embodiments of the present invention will be described with reference to the drawings.",{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0035","num":"0034"},"figref":["FIG. 1","FIG. 2","FIG. 3"],"b":["3","2","1","4","3","5","4"]},"The support base  has a substantially hollow box shape with an upper surface open, and an opening of the upper surface is covered by a detachable cover . A pair of left and right armrests  and  are mounted on both side surfaces of the support base .","While a biasing means configured to bias a backrest  in a standing direction, i.e., a forward direction, and a biasing means configured to bias a seat supported by the support base  in the forward direction (neither illustrated) are installed in the support base , these are not directly related to the present invention, and therefore, illustration and detailed description thereof will be omitted.","The backrest  is configured such that opposing surfaces at an intermediate curved portion are connected via a connecting plate  that is oriented in the left-right direction, and an upper half is mounted on a pair of left and right backrest support rods  and  that stand upward at the rear of the seat  and that has an L-shape when viewed from the side (details will be described later).","Front ends of the left and right backrest support rods  and  are pivotally mounted on the support base  via a left-right directional shaft , and the backrest support rods  and  and the backrest  can rotate in a front-back direction about the shaft  or can stop at a predetermined backward-tilt angle by the operation of a gas spring  whose front and rear ends are connected to a rear end of the support base  and the connecting plate .","The backrest  includes a pair of left and right side rods  and , which are folded in a laid-V shape in a side view at intermediate portions in the up-down direction, that is, portions at a height near the lumbar of a sitting person, and a back plate  that connects opposing surfaces of both of the side rods  and that has a smaller thickness than a front-back dimension of each of the side rods . A left-right dimension and the front-back dimension of the left and right side rods  and  are gradually reduced in the upward direction. Incidentally, the left and right side rods  and  and the back plate  are integrally formed with synthetic resin.","A portion of the back plate  for supporting the back of a sitting person, that is, a portion slightly above folded portions of the side rods  serves as a flexible portion , and a lower half for supporting a portion around and below the lumbar of the sitting person serves as an inflexible portion . The flexible portion is formed at the intermediate portions of the opposing surfaces of both of the side rods  and the inflexible portion is formed at rear edges of both of the side rods  in a continuous manner, so that a step portion  that is recessed backward and that has a horizontal cross-section is formed at an intermediate portion being a connection portion of the flexible portion and the inflexible portion in the up-down direction (see ). Furthermore, a concave portion  that is recessed backward and opened downward is formed on the front surface of the back plate  below the step portion  because the front surface of the inflexible portion is located posteriorly relative to the front surface of the flexible portion ","A lower edge of the flexible portion and a lower surface of the step portion  are curved, in a downward arc shape, toward the vicinity of the folded portions of the side rods .","A pair of front and rear concave grooves  and , the former of which is recessed backward, the latter of which is recessed forward, and both of which are oriented in the up-down direction, are respectively formed in front and rear surfaces of each of the left and right side rods  and  such that the grooves are aligned in the front-back direction. A horizontal cross-section of a portion of each of the side rods  in which the concave grooves  and  are provided has a substantially H-shape (see ). The concave grooves  and  are used to mount a not-shown optional member on the backrest .","As illustrated in enlarged views in  and , a plurality of elongated holes  elongated in the up-down direction and arranged in the up-down and the left-right directions are provided in almost the entire surface of the flexible portion of the back plate  except for the lower end portion, such that the elongated holes are arranged adjacent to each other in a zigzag manner in the left-right direction. This makes the flexible portion to easily bend in a backward convex arc shape when viewed in the planer view, about the elongated holes  arranged in the up-down direction, so that the back of a sitting person can be supported comfortably. A plurality of ribs  that are oriented in the up-down direction are arranged so as to protrude from the rear surface of the flexible portion , so that the bending rigidity of the flexible portion in a direction perpendicular to the elongated holes  increases. Incidentally, the thickness of the flexible portion is approximately uniform, and only the front-back dimensions of the ribs  are gradually reduced in the upward direction (see ).","Grid-like ribs , upper ends of which are continued to the step portion , are arranged so as to protrude from both sides of the front surface of the inflexible portion of the back plate , and the bending rigidity of the inflexible portion is made greater than the bending rigidity of the flexible portion , so that a portion for supporting a sitting person around and below his or her lumbar becomes less likely to bend backward. Incidentally, a front surface plate  made of synthetic resin, which will be described later, is attached to the front surface of the inflexible portion . The front surface plate  is attached across the ribs , so that the front surface plate has a function as the inflexible portion for supporting a sitting person around his or her lumbar.","As illustrated in  and  to , tubular holding portions  and , which can hold the backrest  while determining the positions of the upper ends of the left and right backrest support rods  and which are opened downward, are integrally formed so as to protrude downward from the lower surfaces of both sides of the step portion  of the back plate . The rear surface and a part of the lateral outer surface of each of the holding portions  are respectively connected to the front surface of the inflexible portion and a horizontal piece of each of the grid-like ribs , and the front outer surface of each of the holding portions  and the lower front surface of the flexible portion are connected to each other via vertical ribs  and , so that the left and right holding portions  and  are reinforced.","To mount the backrest  on the left and right backrest support rods  and , first, the left and right holding portions  and  protruding from the lower surface of the step portion  of the back plate  are fitted, from above, to the upper ends of the left and right backrest support rods  and  that are inserted in the concave portion  between the left and right grid-like ribs  and  on the front surface of the inflexible portion of the back plate , so that the backrest  is temporarily held by the left and right backrest support rods  and .","Subsequently, as illustrated in , a front surface of a left-right directional fixing piece  protruding forward from the center portion of the lower front surface of the inflexible portion of the back plate  is brought into contact with the rear surface of the upper end of the connecting plate  that is fixed to the opposing surfaces of the left and right backrest support rods  and . Subsequently, the connecting plate  and the fixing piece  are fixed with fixing screws  and  that are inserted, from the front surface side, into two left and right through holes  and  provided on the connecting plate  and the fixing piece , and with nuts  and . Therefore, the inflexible portion of the back plate  is firmly mounted on the left and right backrest support rods  and .","By mounting the back plate  on the left and right backrest support rods  and  as described above, the tubular holding portions  and  are fitted to the upper ends of both of the backrest support rods , so that the upper ends of the backrest support rods  are prevented from moving forward. Therefore, when the backrest  is reclined, moment in a direction away from the back plate  is not applied to the fixed portion in the lower portion of the back plate . Therefore, it becomes less necessary to increase the fixing strength of the lower portion of the back plate .","Incidentally, in some cases, the through holes  of the fixing piece  may be formed as female screws and the nuts  may be omitted.","Upper portions of the backrest support rods  and the front surface of the inflexible portion of the back plate  are covered by the front surface plate , which is mounted on the front portion of the inflexible portion , which is made of hard synthetic resin in approximately the same shape as the inflexible portion, and which has large bending rigidity.","The front surface plate  is, as illustrated in , fixedly attached so as to be aligned with the same plane as the front surface of the flexible portion by press fitting four tubular protrusions , which protrude backward from the top, bottom, left, and right of the rear surface thereof, into appropriate four of fitting holes  (see ) formed at the intersections of the grid-like ribs . Incidentally, an upper portion of the front surface plate , that is, a portion for supporting a sitting person around his or her lumbar is curved in a laid-V shape when viewed from the side (see ).","The front surface of the front surface plate , the front surface of the flexible portion of the back plate , and the rear surface of the flexible portion of the back plate  are covered by a cushion material  that is folded in half.","As described above, according to the chair of the embodiment, the concave portion  that is opened downward is provided below the intermediate portion of the front surface of the back plate  in the up-down direction, and, the tubular holding portions  and , which protrude downward from the lower surface of the step portion  and which are opened downward, are fitted to the upper ends of the left and right backrest support rods  and  that are inserted in the concave portion . Therefore, it is possible to easily determine the position of the back plate  and temporarily hold the back plate , with respect to both of the backrest support rods .","Therefore, fixing operation of the lower portion of the back plate , that is, screwing operation between the fixing piece  protruding from the inflexible portion and the connecting plate  connecting the left and right backrest support rods  and  can be made much easier.","Furthermore, the left and right tubular holding portions  and  are formed so as to be integrated with and continued to the step portion  and the front surface of the inflexible portion of the back plate , and the bending strength in the front-back and the left-right directions is increased. Therefore, even by only fitting both of the holding portions  and  to the upper ends of the left and right backrest support rods  and , it becomes possible to stably hold the intermediate portion of the back plate  by the upper ends of the backrest support rods  and .","Therefore, it becomes not necessary to fix the intermediate portion of the back plate  to the upper ends of the backrest support rods  by a fixing means, such as screws, and, it becomes possible to fully ensure the mounting strength of the back plate  with respect to the backrest support rods  even by fixing only the lower portion of the back plate  to the connecting plate  of the backrest support rods  with screws. Therefore, it becomes not necessary to use a special connecting member or to fix the back plate with screws at two portions at the top and bottom as in the conventional technology. As a result, the number of components and costs can be reduced.","The upper half of the back plate  for supporting the back of a sitting person is used as the flexible portion , a lower half including the front surface plate  for supporting the sitting person around and below the lumbar is used as the inflexible portion , the upper half and the lower half of the back plate  are distinctly separated as an easy-to-bend portion and a hard-to-bend portion, the concave portion  formed below the intermediate portion of the back plate  is supported by the backrest support rods , and the flexible portion and the inflexible portion are continuously provided on the opposing surfaces of a pair of the left and right side rods  and , each having a laid-V shape when viewed from the side and having higher rigidity. Therefore, the flexible portion can more easily bend backward in more upper portions, so that it becomes possible to comfortably support the back of a sitting person via the cushion material  and to comfortably support the lumbar of the sitting person due to the lumbar support effect by the inflexible portion having the higher rigidity than that of the flexible portion and by the front surface plate  on the front surface of the inflexible portion.","The present invention is not limited to the above embodiment.","In the embodiment, the concave portion  is formed in the front surface of the back plate , and the holding portions  and  continued to the step portion , which is formed on the upper surface of the concave portion and which is recessed backward, are fitted to the upper ends of the backrest support rods  and . However, in contrast, a concave portion that is recessed forward and opened downward may be provided on the rear surface of the back plate , and holding portions as described above may be formed in a continuous manner on a step surface, which is formed on the upper surface of the concave portion and which is recessed forward, such that the holding portions are fitted to the upper ends of the backrest support rods . In this case, the front surface plate  is not needed, the lower half of the back plate  serves as the inflexible portion as it is, and a rear surface plate is fixedly attached to the rear surface of the concave portion that is recessed forward.","Furthermore, it may be possible to provide grid-like ribs protruding from the rear surface of the inflexible portion in the lower half in order to reinforce the lower half.","The present invention may be applied to a chair in which the cushion material  is not mounted on the backrest .",{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0063","num":"0000"},"ul":{"@attributes":{"id":"ul0001","list-style":"none"},"li":{"@attributes":{"id":"ul0001-0001","num":"0000"},"ul":{"@attributes":{"id":"ul0002","list-style":"none"},"li":[{"@attributes":{"id":"ul0002-0001","num":"0062"},"b":"1"},{"@attributes":{"id":"ul0002-0002","num":"0063"},"b":"2"},{"@attributes":{"id":"ul0002-0003","num":"0064"},"b":"3"},{"@attributes":{"id":"ul0002-0004","num":"0065"},"b":"4"},{"@attributes":{"id":"ul0002-0005","num":"0066"},"b":"5"},{"@attributes":{"id":"ul0002-0006","num":"0067"},"b":"5","i":"a "},{"@attributes":{"id":"ul0002-0007","num":"0068"},"b":"6"},{"@attributes":{"id":"ul0002-0008","num":"0069"},"b":"7"},{"@attributes":{"id":"ul0002-0009","num":"0070"},"b":"8"},{"@attributes":{"id":"ul0002-0010","num":"0071"},"b":"9"},{"@attributes":{"id":"ul0002-0011","num":"0072"},"b":"10"},{"@attributes":{"id":"ul0002-0012","num":"0073"},"b":"11"},{"@attributes":{"id":"ul0002-0013","num":"0074"},"b":"12"},{"@attributes":{"id":"ul0002-0014","num":"0075"},"b":"13"},{"@attributes":{"id":"ul0002-0015","num":"0076"},"b":"13","i":"a "},{"@attributes":{"id":"ul0002-0016","num":"0077"},"b":"14"},{"@attributes":{"id":"ul0002-0017","num":"0078"},"b":"14","i":"a "},{"@attributes":{"id":"ul0002-0018","num":"0079"},"b":"14","i":"b "},{"@attributes":{"id":"ul0002-0019","num":"0080"},"b":"15"},{"@attributes":{"id":"ul0002-0020","num":"0081"},"b":"16"},{"@attributes":{"id":"ul0002-0021","num":"0082"},"b":"17"},{"@attributes":{"id":"ul0002-0022","num":"0083"},"b":"18"},{"@attributes":{"id":"ul0002-0023","num":"0084"},"b":"19"},{"@attributes":{"id":"ul0002-0024","num":"0085"},"b":"20"},{"@attributes":{"id":"ul0002-0025","num":"0086"},"b":"21"},{"@attributes":{"id":"ul0002-0026","num":"0087"},"b":"22"},{"@attributes":{"id":"ul0002-0027","num":"0088"},"b":"23"},{"@attributes":{"id":"ul0002-0028","num":"0089"},"b":"24"},{"@attributes":{"id":"ul0002-0029","num":"0090"},"b":"25"},{"@attributes":{"id":"ul0002-0030","num":"0091"},"b":"26"},{"@attributes":{"id":"ul0002-0031","num":"0092"},"b":"27"},{"@attributes":{"id":"ul0002-0032","num":"0093"},"b":"28"},{"@attributes":{"id":"ul0002-0033","num":"0094"},"b":"29"},{"@attributes":{"id":"ul0002-0034","num":"0095"},"b":"30"},{"@attributes":{"id":"ul0002-0035","num":"0096"},"b":"31"}]}}}}],"brief-description-of-drawings":[{},{}],"description-of-drawings":{"heading":"BRIEF DESCRIPTION OF DRAWINGS","p":[{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0025","num":"0024"},"figref":"FIG. 1"},{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0026","num":"0025"},"figref":"FIG. 2"},{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0027","num":"0026"},"figref":"FIG. 3"},{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0028","num":"0027"},"figref":"FIG. 4"},{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0029","num":"0028"},"figref":["FIG. 5","FIG. 4"]},{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0030","num":"0029"},"figref":["FIG. 6","FIG. 4"]},{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0031","num":"0030"},"figref":"FIG. 7"},{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0032","num":"0031"},"figref":["FIG. 8","FIG. 7"]},{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0033","num":"0032"},"figref":["FIG. 9","FIG. 7"]}]},"DETDESC":[{},{}]}
