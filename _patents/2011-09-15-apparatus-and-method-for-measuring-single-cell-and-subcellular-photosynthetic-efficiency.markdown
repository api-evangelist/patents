title: Apparatus and method for measuring single cell and sub-cellular photosynthetic efficiency
abstract: Devices for measuring single cell changes in photosynthetic efficiency in algal aquaculture are disclosed that include a combination of modulated LED trans-illumination of different intensities with synchronized through objective laser illumination and confocal detection. Synchronization and intensity modulation of a dual illumination scheme were provided using a custom microcontroller for a laser beam block and constant current LED driver. Therefore, single whole cell photosynthetic efficiency, and subcellular (diffraction limited) photosynthetic efficiency measurement modes are permitted. Wide field rapid light scanning actinic illumination is provided for both by an intensity modulated 470 nm LED. For the whole cell photosynthetic efficiency measurement, the same LED provides saturating pulses for generating photosynthetic induction curves. For the subcellular photosynthetic efficiency measurement, a switched through objective 488 nm laser provides saturating pulses for generating photosynthetic induction curves. A second near IR LED is employed to generate dark adapted states in the system under study.

More particularly, the invention relates to the design of an optical spectrometer design and a custom microcontroller for performing rapid light scanning of single plant cells and sub-cellular structures in single plant cells, such as chloroplasts, using modified pulse amplitude modulated fluorescence spectrometry, and as a means for determining the local photosynthetic efficiencies of these structures.","Bulk photosynthetic efficiency measurements of microalgal suspensions suffer from artifacts and replication difficulties as a result of sample flocculation, cellular motility, and other inhomogeneities. A previous report has documented these effects concluding that one potential solution, sample stirring, introduces additional confounding artifacts (Cosgrove J., Borowitzka M., \u201cApplying pulse amplitude modulated (PAM) fluorometry to microalgal suspensions: stirring potentially impacts fluorescence,\u201d 2006, v. 88: pp. 343-350). These problems can be effectively mediated, however, by employing a strategy which measures photosynthetic efficiency on single plant cells.","The purpose of the invention, therefore, was to create a device capable of measuring the changes in photosynthetic efficiency, i.e., the fraction of light energy converted into chemical energy during photosynthesis in single cells of plant matter induced by changes in environmental factors related to growth and development. This was achieved by employing a combination of intensity modulated LED trans-illumination with synchronized through-objective laser illumination and confocal detection. Synchronization and intensity modulation of the dual illumination scheme were provided by using a custom designed microcontroller for a laser beam block and constant current LED driver. With this apparatus, two complementary measurement modes are permitted: 1) single, whole-cell photosynthetic efficiency; and 2) diffraction limited, sub-cellular photosynthetic efficiency. In both cases, wide field rapid light scanning using actinic illumination is provided by an intensity-modulated 470 nm LED. In the case of the whole-cell photosynthetic efficiency measurement, the same LED provides saturating pulses for generating photosynthetic induction curves. For the sub-cellular photosynthetic efficiency measurement, a switched through-objective 488 nm laser provides saturating pulses for generating photosynthetic induction curves. Finally, a second near-IR LED is employed to rapidly generate a dark adapted state in the plant systems under study.","The purpose of the invention was to create a device capable of measuring changes in single-cell photosynthetic efficiency induced by environmental factors in algal aquaculture.

Optics control module  further comprises a microprocessor , which itself comprises visual display , a data acquisition recorder , electrically communicating with an automatic voltage regulation (AVR) microcontroller , an LED driver  and a relay board .","Optics control module  comprises actinic trans-illumination source controller , avalanche photodiode (APD) shutter control  and epi-illumination (i.e., illumination and detection from one side of the sample) source control , each of which electrically interface with various components of optical module  such that each is under the control of microprocessor . In particular, data acquisition recorder  provides an electrical interface between APD shutter control  and with epi-illumination source control  and microprocessor . APD shutter control , in turn, electrically communicates with dichroic fiber optic couplings and which are themselves optically coupled, respectively, with APD and such that both couplings and act as binary gates to restrict light from entering either or both of APD and when APD shutter control  switches either or both of dichroic fiber optic couplings and \u201con\u201d or \u201coff\u201d at the direction of microprocessor . APD and are themselves in electrical communication with DAQ  thereby providing a feed-back loop to microprocessor . Moreover, DAQ recorder  is also in electrical communication with AVR microcontroller  and LED driver  which are electrically coupled in series with actinic trans-illumination source controller  such that each can be controlled by microprocessor . Finally, optical module  further comprises frame grabber  in electrical communication with charge couple diode (CCD) camera . Frame grabber , therefore, acts as an interface with part of optical detection module  in order to provide for copying and storing images of the subject matter under observation.","Radiation for illuminating plant matter is supplied by epi-illumination source module  and by dual illumination source module . Source  comprises LED source  providing actinic radiation  at a wavelength of about 488 nm and epi-illumination shutter  electrically coupled with and driven by epi-illumination control . Dual source  comprises dual LED  providing infrared radiation  at a wavelength of greater than about 750 nm and actinic radiation  at a wavelength of about 470 nm.","Optical detection module  comprises CCD camera  for receiving light beam  output from microscope objective . Light beam  is itself comprised of the light response of plant matter illuminated by either or both of beams  and  generated by epi-illumination source module  and dual illumination source module . Light beam  therefore might be expected to comprise a plurality of light rays having wavelengths covering the full ranges of the visible spectrum corresponding to red , yellow , green , and blue  rays output from the sample being investigated (not shown), and collected by objective  and passed through blue long pass dichroic filter . Beam  is the split by beam splitter  which divides beam  equally between CCD camera  and short pass dichroic filter  which passes only red wavelengths  between about 670 nm to about 700 nm to first dichroic fiber optic coupling and reflects all other wavelengths onto long pass dichroic filter  which itself reflects only yellow wavelengths  between about 575 nm to about 585 nm into second dichroic fiber optic coupling while allowing all other wavelengths to pass through (not shown). Finally, depending upon the timing sequence generated by microprocessor , the first and second dichroic fiber couples and may be enabled allowing light to enter either or both of APD and , thereby providing an electronic signal proportional to the intensity of the light signal received by APD and\/or .","In operation, device  functions as follows. A quantity of plant matter, such as algae, is exposed to known environmental conditions while growing. Cells obtained from a quantity of plant matter of interest are placed on a transparent substrate (not shown), mounted onto translatable microscope stage , and the stage moved to center the cell sample under microscope objective . Once microscope stage  is properly positioned, microprocessor  commands trans-illumination source controller  to drive LED dual source  to illuminate the plant cells from behind, exposing them to a flux of infrared (IR) radiation , having a wavelength of greater than about 750 nm. This pre-conditioning is done because exposure to IR radiation is known to \u201cdrain\u201d off native charge in the plant cells in excited states, thereby returning the these cells to a ground state.","Once the plant cells have been pre-conditioned by infrared radiation microscope , microprocessor  now commands trans-illumination source controller  to again illuminate the cells from behind with actinic radiation  from dual LED source  at a wavelength of about 470 nm. This initial illumination stimulates the endogenous chromophores in the plant cells to fluoresce and provide the baseline light signal Fshown in . The plant cells are then exposed to a short saturating light pulse from above (epi-illumination), again driven by microprocessor , directing epi-illumination control  to open shutter  such that LED source  supplies actinic radiation  at a wavelength of 488 nm through microscope objective , while the background trans-illumination light actinic radiation  remains \u201con.\u201d The epi-illumination pulse is focused on specific areas of an individual cell in order to stimulate that area within the cell. This results in a sharp spike in detected fluorescence which rapidly decays, subsequently, to a steady state value","Light will excite chlorophyll a of photo-system (PS) II into its excited state where it can then transfer an electron into the electron transport chain (ETC) between PS II and PS I. As electrons are transferred through the ETC, the initial electron acceptor in PS II is depleted (\u201copens\u201d) and is able to accept a new electron. Under high light conditions, this system will eventually become saturated, as all reaction centers will become occupied by electrons. When the reaction centers are occupied (\u201cclosed\u201d), new electrons cannot be accepted at the rate at which chlorophyll a is being excited, and the chlorophyll will release the excess energy in the form of fluorescence light.","The efficiency with which light energy is utilized by a plant cell is a function of the health of that cell. When plant cells are under stress, their photo-systems can become saturated more easily. As such, these systems do not process light as efficiently as un-stressed cells. By interrogating plant cells as described below, it is possible to measure how effectively these cells convert light energy into chemical energy, i.e., to measure the photosynthetic efficiency of the cell.","In order to measure the photosynthetic efficiency of an unknown sample of plant matter, that sample is first dark-adapted (or treated with far red IR radiation as described above) for a period of time so that all of electron acceptors in the reaction centers are \u201copen\u201d and able to accept electrons. The fluorescence of this system is measured when the most light energy can be accepted into the ETC for photochemistry by initially illuminating the sample with a continuous source of actinic light. The measured fluorescence of this initial response is designated as F, as shown in . The sample is then exposed to a high intensity pulse of actinic light modulated on the continuous background light in order to saturate all of the electron acceptors and thereby close the reaction centers. All absorbed light energy at this point will then be given off as a pulse of fluorescent light, F. As shown in , the difference between the initial fluorescence, F, and the maximum measured fluorescence, F, is defined as the variable fluorescence, F. It is known that Fnormalized to F, i.e., F\/F, is taken to be a measure of the maximum photosynthetic efficiency of dark-adapted plant cells.","To obtain a measure of the photosynthetic efficiency during light adaption, an additional light induction curve measurement is made. During this measurement, following the initial saturating pulse, the intensity of photosynthetically active radiation intensity is stepped up, as shown in , and subsequent saturating pulses are interleaved on the background actinic light source to scan the photosynthetically active radiation intensity range of the sample.","Upon continuous illumination with moderately excess light, a combination of mechanisms, known as photochemical quenching (Q, the decrease in fluorescence yield due to excitation energy being used for photochemical reactions, i.e., photosynthesis) and non-photochemical quenching (Q, several protective non-photochemical mechanisms developed by plants and used during photosynthesis to dissipate excess energy as heat), lowers the fluorescence yield generated by the saturating pulses. Again, as shown in , Qcan be seen as the difference between Fand the measured maximum fluorescence after a later saturating light pulse, F, during illumination. Moreover, Qis found to be the difference between the maximum measure fluorescence of the later saturating light pulse and the background steady state light level, F.",{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0024","num":"0023"},"figref":"FIG. 4"},"From the foregoing, it will be appreciated that, although specific embodiments of the invention have been described herein for purposes of illustration, various modifications and other alternatives, or adaptations may be made without deviating from the spirit and scope of the invention.
