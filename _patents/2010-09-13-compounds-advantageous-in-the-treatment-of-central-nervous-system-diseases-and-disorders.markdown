title: Compounds advantageous in the treatment of central nervous system diseases and disorders
abstract: A series of novel compounds showing anticonvulsant, chemical countermeasure(s), and analgesic activities is described. Such pharmaceutically active compounds may also show utility in the treatment of other central nervous system (“CNS”) diseases and disorders, such as anxiety, depression, insomnia, migraine headaches, schizophrenia, Parkinson's disease, spasticity, Alzheimer's disease, and bipolar disorder. Furthermore, such compounds may additionally find utility as analgesics (e.g., for the treatment of chronic or neuropathic pain) and as neuroprotective agents useful in the treatment of stroke(s), chronic neurodegenerative diseases (such as Alzheimer's disease and Huntington's disease), and/or traumatic brain and/or spinal cord injuries. Moreover, these/such compounds may also be useful in the treatment of status epilepticus and/or as chemical countermeasures.

No. 61\/037,987 filed 19 Mar. 2008 \u201cNOVEL COMPOUNDS ADVANTAGEOUS IN THE TREATMENT OF CENTRAL NERVOUS SYSTEM DISEASES AND DISORDERS.\u201d The above listed applications are incorporated by reference in their entirety.","1. The Field of the Invention","The present invention relates to novel compounds showing activity in the central nervous systems (CNS). More specifically, the present invention relates to novel compounds with anticonvulsant activity that exhibit increased\/improved toxicological safety (i.e., decreased toxicity), increased\/improved metabolic stability, longer half-life, and\/or a superior side effect profile, while producing similar or increased biological activity (i.e., efficacy), when compared to currently available CNS therapeutic agents.","2. The Related Technology","A number of pathological conditions (e.g., epilepsy, stroke, bipolar affective disorder, migraine headaches, anxiety, depression, insomnia, schizophrenia, chronic or neuropathic pain, spasticity, spinal cord injury, and chronic neurodegenerative disorders), and diseases (e.g., Parkinson's disease, Huntington's disease, and Alzheimer's disease) are characterized by abnormalities in the normal function of the central nervous system (CNS). These conditions and diseases typically respond to pharmacologic intervention with compounds or substances that modulate CNS activity. Compounds with this activity include the compounds of the present invention, which are herein disclosed to treat abnormalities of the CNS, such as epilepsy. While currently available therapeutants often have good CNS activity, they frequently exhibit other undesirable properties, such as chronic toxicity, severe and\/or unpleasant side effects, and inadequate pharmacokinetic properties, such as a short pharmacologic half-life. For example, a short half-life in a CNS therapeutant may require its frequent administration in order to sustain therapeutic concentrations of the drug without eliciting adverse effects, and where frequent dosing schedules are required, the cost of therapy may increase. In addition, as the required dosing frequency increases, patient compliance tends to decrease. It would therefore be desirable to provide additional compounds that modulate CNS activity and have improved properties, such as, e.g., an increased half-life, increased activity (i.e., improved efficacy), and\/or increased metabolic stability (e.g., fewer toxic metabolites) when compared to those of currently available therapies. Furthermore, improved and simpler\/simplified synthetic and chemical manufacturing processes can be developed which can help to make the useful compounds of the invention more widely available to a larger portion of the patient population.","Related art may be found in U.S. Pat. No. 5,463,125 (Sandoval et al., \u201cPhenyl alcohol amides having anticonvulsant activity\u201d), WO9941229 [Carvajal Sandoval et al., \u201cHalogenated phenyl alcohol amides (ligands of GABAB receptor) having an anticonvulsant activity\u201d], WO03091201 (Carvajal Sandoval et al., \u201cDL-Hydroxy-alkyl-phenylamides having anticonvulsive activity\u201d), WO2005085182 (Meza Toledo, \u201cDL-Hydroxybenzamides having anticonvulsive activity\u201d), and U.S. Patent Application 20060287397 (Meza Toledo, \u201cDl-Hydroxy-alkyl-phenylamides having anticonvulsive activity\u201d). An important distinction between the art cited above and that of the present invention is that the cited art contains and refers to compounds which are structurally related to gamma-hydroxybutyric acid (gamma-hydroxybutyrate, or GHB), whereas the compounds of the present invention are structurally related to 3-methylbutyramide.","It is noteworthy that the derivatization (N-alkylation) of the nitrogen atom of amide groups has produced compounds such as N,N-diethylisovaleramide (A. Liebrecht, German Patent 129,967, issued 1902), which has been marketed previously as a sedative (\u201cValyl\u201d) (see various editions of ). However, this compound has been shown instead to exhibit CNS-stimulating, anxiogenic, and convulsant properties (U.S. Pat. No. 5,506,268). Indeed, N-methylated amide derivatives can show either CNS-stimulating or -depressing properties, whereas N-ethyl and larger derivatives generally possess CNS-stimulating properties [Volwiler, E. H. and D. L. Tabern, . (1936) 58:1352-1354; Nelson et al., . (1941) 30:180-182].","Thus, N,N-disubstituted amide compounds such as cropropamide, crotethamide, ethamivan, nikethamide, N,N-diethylisovaleramide (U.S. Pat. No. 5,506,268), and the insect repellent, DEET (N,N-diethyl-m-toluamide), have all been shown to exhibit CNS-(proconvulsant-) and respiratory-stimulating properties in mammals (including humans). Cropropamide, crotethamide, ethamivan, and niketamide have been used as CNS and respiratory stimulants in humans, e.g., to counteract the potentially life-threatening CNS- and respiratory-depressing effects of barbiturate poisoning (overdose) (various editions of and W. O. Foye's ).","It is also noteworthy that the primary amide, modafinil (ProVigil) has been shown to possess CNS-stimulant and pro-alertness (pro-vigilance) properties [see the current (14th) edition of ","A series of novel amides with anticonvulsant, chemical countermeasure(s), and analgesic activities are herein disclosed. These amides modulate CNS activity, by enhancing inhibitory, or decreasing excitatory, neurotransmission centrally, without complete suppression of all activity. Pursuant to the present invention, therefore, a subject who receives such an agent is not overtly sedated, anesthetized, or paralyzed in the context of, for example, decreasing seizures (no anesthesia), decreasing muscle tone (no paralysis), eliciting a calmative effect (no sedation), or ameliorating an ambulatory syndrome such as spasticity (no weakness or flaccidity).","Many of the amides disclosed herein have a phenyl group attached to the amide moiety via a short and variously branched\/substituted aliphatic linker. Other compounds of the invention are amide derivatives of optically active amino acids (e.g., D or L), such as alanine, valine, leucine, isoleucine, or phenylalanine, or the optically inactive amino acids, glycine or taurine.","In one embodiment, a CNS-active compound having Formula I is disclosed.",{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0014","num":"0013"},"chemistry":{"@attributes":{"id":"CHEM-US-00001","num":"00001"},"img":{"@attributes":{"id":"EMI-C00001","he":"13.72mm","wi":"61.30mm","file":"US09212155-20151215-C00001.TIF","alt":"embedded image","img-content":"chem","img-format":"tif"}}}},"In Formula I, Ar can be an optionally substituted phenyl, optionally substituted naphthyl, optionally substituted tetrahydronaphthyl, optionally substituted indane, or an optionally substituted heterocyclic aryl, wherein up to 5 substituents may be present.

Overview","The inventors have discovered that the compounds of the invention and certain of their pharmacologically active analogs and congeners can be administered in vivo to effect a modulation of CNS activity. That is, these agents modulate CNS activity, by enhancing inhibitory, or decreasing excitatory, neurotransmission centrally, without complete suppression of all activity. Pursuant to the present invention, therefore, a subject who receives such an agent is not overtly sedated, anesthetized, or paralyzed in the context of, for example, decreasing seizures (no anesthesia), decreasing muscle tone (no paralysis), eliciting a calmative effect (no sedation), or ameliorating an ambulatory syndrome such as spasticity (no weakness or flaccidity).","A number of pathologies, exemplified by convulsions (seizures), spasticity, affective mood disorders, such as bipolar mood disorder, headaches (chronic, cluster, migraine), restlessness syndromes, neuropathic pain, and movement disorders, have at least one symptom that is alleviated by a modulation of CNS activity. Accordingly, an individual who suffers from such a pathology is a candidate for therapy that entails, pursuant to the present invention, the individuals receiving a pharmaceutical formulation or composition containing the compounds of the invention or one of their structurally related analogs or congeners as one of the principal active ingredients.","2. Exemplary Pathologies Ameliorated by a Modulation of Central Nervous System (CNS) Activity","CONVULSIONS: Epilepsy is a common disorder which has many causes, and it can be very difficult to control clinically, often requiring treatment for many years to keep seizures under control. Researchers have stated that \u201c[a]t this time, there is no satisfactory treatment for epilepsy in a substantial proportion of patients. Clinical trials have shown that certain patients have a better response to one drug than another, even when the patients have similar types of seizures and the drugs have similar mechanisms of action. The frequency and severity of side effects also varies substantially. Thus, multiple medications with different mechanisms of action and attendant side effects will be needed for treatment of epilepsy until either epilepsy can be cured or a potent, safe new drug with broad activity is discovered\u201d and developed. Dichter et al., 334:1583 (1996).","Due to the widespread availability of reasonably predictive and experimentally accessible animal models of convulsant states, a number of clinically useful anticonvulsants have been prepared and developed. For example, see Cereghino et al., \u201cIntroduction,\u201d in ANTIEPILEPTIC DRUGS, 4th ed., pages 1-11 (Rave Press 1995), which states: \u201cIn many patients, seizures can be controlled with currently available antiepileptic drugs, but 25 to 30 percent of patients continue to have seizures despite optimal therapy, while many others experience unacceptable side effects.\u201d Dichter et al. (1996) supra.","Thus, many anticonvulsants in clinical use are plagued by the occurrence of significant side effects, including troublesome daytime sedation, muscular weakness, tolerance, gingival hyperplasia, and potentially fatal blood dyscrasias and hepatotoxicity. Many of these side effects are especially of concern in the clinical management (treatment) of epilepsy in children.","The present invention can be used to treat convulsive disorders such as epilepsy. That is, the compositions and pharmaceutical formulations and compositions of the invention display \u201canticonvulsant activity,\u201d which is evidenced by a reduction of the severity, number, or duration of convulsions in animal models of epilepsy. To alleviate convulsions includes reducing the severity, number of duration of convulsions in a patient. Accordingly, the novel compositions and pharmaceutical formulations and compositions should be useful in treating conditions such as, but not limited to, generalized tonic-clonic seizures, absence seizures, myoclonic seizures, simple partial seizures, complex partial seizures, secondarily generalized partial seizures, status epilepticus, and trauma-induced seizures, as occur following head injury or surgery.","SPASTICITY: Spasticity is a disorder characterized by an increase in tonic stretch reflexes (muscle tone) with exaggerated tendon jerks resulting from hyperexcitability of the stretch reflex. Lance, Symposia synopsis, in SPASTICITY\u2014DISORDERED MOTOR CONTROL, Feldman et al. (Eds.) (1980). Major disease states and conditions associated with spasticity include multiple sclerosis, cerebral palsy, stroke, trauma or injury to the spinal cord, and head trauma. Symptoms that occur with spasticity include painful flexor and extensor spasms, increased or exaggerated deep-tendon reflexes, clonus, muscular weakness, fatigue, lack of dexterity, various degrees of loss of general motor function, paralysis, and impairment of sleep.","The pathological states observed in spasticity are fundamentally different at the physiological level from the commonly experienced acute muscular aches, strains, and sprains that occur from a localized external insult to a particular muscle, i.e., outside of or peripheral to the CNS. These pathological states also are different from the relatively common involuntary spasms or smooth muscle, such as vascular spasms, bladder spasms, and bronchial spasms. Such non-spastic (non-CNS), peripheral or localized symptoms are commonly treated with so-called \u201cantispasmodic\u201d or \u201cspasmolytic\u201d agents, but these generally are not useful in treating spasticity. Cedarbaum & Schleifer, \u201cDrugs for Parkinson's Disease, Spasticity and Acute Muscle Spasms,\u201d in GOODMAN AND GILMAN'S THE PHARMACOLOGICAL BASIS OF THERAPEUTICS, 8th ed. [hereafter GOODMAN AND GILMAN'S], pages 463-484 (Pergamon Press 1990).","The compositions of matter and pharmaceutical formulations and compositions employed in accordance with the present invention can cause a centrally mediated decrease in muscle tone and, hence, are useful for the acute or chronic alleviation of one or more symptoms or side effects of spasticity. In this context, \u201cspasticity\u201d refers to a heightened tone of skeletal muscle with is manifested by symptoms such as, but not limited to, painful flexor or extensor spasms, increased or exaggerated deep-tendon reflexes, hyperreflexia, loss of dexterity, muscular weakness, exaggerated tendon jerks, and clonus. The phrase \u201cantispasticity agent\u201d refers here to a composition that is useful for the symptomatic treatment of spasticity, as demonstrated by the alleviation of at least one of the following manifestations or side effects of spasticity: painful flexor or extensor spasms, increased or exaggerated deep-tendon reflexes, hyperreflexia, loss of dexterity, muscular weakness, exaggerated tendon jerks, and clonus, or the reduction of the frequency of these manifestations or side effects.","Accordingly, the \u201calleviation\u201d of spasticity refers here to the lessening of one or more symptoms of spasticity, including, but not limited to, painful flexor or extensor spasms, increased or exaggerated deep-tendon reflexes, hyperreflexia, loss of dexterity, muscle weakness, exaggerated tendon jerks, and clonus, or the reduction of the frequency of these manifestations or side effects.","AFFECTIVE MOOD DISORDERS: These include conditions ranging from depression to dysphoric mania, for example, mania, schizoaffective disorder, traumatic brain injury-induced aggression, post-traumatic stress disorder, bipolar mood disorder, panic states, and behavioral dyscontrol syndromes. See Emrich et al., 8:243-250 (1985) and Bernasconi et al., in ANTICONVULSANTS IN AFFECTIVE DISORDERS, pages 14-32 (1984). The novel compositions and pharmaceutical formulations and compositions according to the present invention are effective in the treatment of these diseases, disorders, and conditions, and should exhibit improved side effect profiles when compared to currently existing therapeutic agents in this therapeutic category.","NEUROPATHIC PAIN SYNDROMES: Conditions in this category, involving \u201cneuropathic pain,\u201d affect a significant number of patients suffering from disorders of the brain or spinal cord, such as stroke, trauma, multiple sclerosis, and diabetes. Casey, in PAIN AND CENTRAL NERVOUS SYSTEM DISEASE (Raven 1991). The use of anticonvulsants to treat various pain states has been documented extensively. Swendlow, 7: 51-82 (1984). Thus, a novel composition or pharmaceutical formulation or composition of the present invention can be applied in similar fashion to ameliorate neuropathic pain.","HEADACHES: Headaches of the migraine type [Hering and Kuritzky, 12: 81-84 (1992)], the cluster type [Hering and Kuritzky, loc. cit. 9:195-198 (1989)], and the chronic type [Mathew and Sabiha, 31: 71-74 (1991)] have been treated with anticonvulsants. The compositions and formulations of the present invention can therefore be used to alleviate the symptoms associated with each of these three headache types, without the adverse side effects of current existing therapies.","RESTLESSNESS SYNDROME: The phrase \u201crestlessness syndrome\u201d denotes a somatic (non-mental) restlessness characterized by involuntary movement of the limbs, as well as by a sense of physical (rather than mental) agitation, which is independent of mood and, hence, is distinguished from restlessness per se. [See Sachev et al., 30:38-53 (1996)].","Restlessness syndromes, inclusive of numerous indications, can be observed in association with many organic and non-organic psychiatric illnesses. For example, drug-induced restlessness (tardive, chronic, and withdrawal akathisias), such as drug-induced extrapyramidal symptoms, is one of the most common side effects of neuroleptic drug therapy. Also within the restlessness-syndrome rubric are the so-called \u201crestless leg syndrome\u201d and \u201csleep-related periodic leg movements,\u201d pathologies that can be associated with head and\/or spinal cord trauma and with lesions of the spinal cord. Idiopathic restless leg syndrome follows an autosomal dominant inheritance, with a variable clinical expression of symptoms. See O'Keefe, 156: 243-248 (1996); Danek et al., in NEUROLOGICAL DISORDERS: COURSE AND TREATMENT, pages 819-823 (Academic Press 1996); Mellick and Mellick, 45(suppl.): 285-286 (1995). The present invention provides an effective therapy for restlessness syndromes with minimal side effects.","MOVEMENT DISORDERS: Various agents are known to decrease the dyskinetic movement characterizing movement disorders such as Parkinson's disease, Huntington's chorea, Alzheimer's disease, tardive dyskinesia, and stiff-man syndrome. Lloyd and Morselli, in PSYCHOPHARMACOLOGY: THE THIRD GENERATION OF PROGRESS (Raven Press 1987). A therapy within the present invention alleviates one or more symptoms of a movement disorder.","The compounds of the invention may also be useful as anxiety-reducing (anxiolytic) agents.","By \u201cneurological disorder or disease\u201d is meant a disorder or disease of the nervous system including, but not limited to, epilepsy, anxiety, multiple sclerosis, strokes, head trauma, spinal cord injuries, and chronic neurodegenerative diseases such as Parkinson's and Huntington's diseases, Alzheimer's disease, and amyotrophic lateral sclerosis. Also meant by \u201cneurological disorder or disease\u201d are those disease states and conditions in which an antispastic or anticonvulsant may be indicated, useful, recommended and\/or prescribed.","By \u201cneurodegenerative disease\u201d is meant diseases such as, but not limited to, Huntington's Disease, Parkinson's Disease, Alzheimer's Disease, and amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (ALS).","By \u201canticonvulsant\u201d is meant a compound capable of reducing the severity, number, or duration of convulsions produced, observed, or found in conditions such as generalized tonic-clonic seizures, absence seizures, myoclonic seizures, simple partial seizures, complex partial seizures, secondarily generalized partial seizures, status epilepticus, and trauma-induced seizures as occur following head injury or surgery.","By \u201canticonvulsant activity\u201d is meant efficacy in reducing the severity, number, or duration of convulsions produced, observed, or found in conditions such as generalized tonic-clonic seizures, absence seizures, myoclonic seizures, simple partial seizures, complex partial seizures, secondarily generalized partial seizures, status epilepticus, and trauma-induced seizures, as occur following head injury or surgery.","By \u201ctherapeutic dose\u201d is meant an amount of a compound that relieves to some extent one or more symptoms of the disease or condition of the patient. Additionally, by \u201ctherapeutic dose\u201d is meant an amount that returns to normal, either partially or completely, physiological or biochemical parameters associated with or causative of the disease or condition. Generally, it is an amount between about 0.1-15-20-30 mg\/kg body weight, depending on the age, size, and disease associated with the patient. The dosing can be one to four times a day.","By \u201cpharmaceutical composition\u201d is meant a therapeutically effective amount of a compound of the present invention in a pharmaceutically acceptable carrier, i.e., a formulation to which the compound can be added to dissolve or otherwise facilitate administration of the compound. Examples of pharmaceutically acceptable carriers include water, saline, and physiologically buffered saline. Such a pharmaceutical composition is provided in a suitable dose. Such compositions are generally those which are approved for use in treatment of a specific disorder by the FDA or its equivalent in non-U.S. countries.","It is understood that certain of the compounds of the present invention have one or more chiral stereocenter(s). Such compounds may demonstrate preferred biological activity as a racemic (or diastereomeric) mixture, as a mixture of R and S enantiomers (or diastereomers), or as pure enantiomers (R or S) (or diastereomers). When one pure enantiomer shows preferred biological activity, it is this preferred enantiomer is referred to as the eutomer, whereas the less preferred, less biologically active enantiomer is referred to as the distomer.","METHODS FOR PREPARING PHARMACEUTICAL FORMULATIONS AND COMPOSITIONS, AND METHODS FOR ADMINISTRATION: As demonstrated herein, useful pharmaceutical formulations and compositions of this invention may be used to treat neurological disorders or diseases. While these preparations will typically be used in therapy for human patients, they may also be used to treat similar or identical diseases in other vertebrates such as other primates, domestic animals, farm animals such as swine, cattle, and poultry, and sports animals and pets such as horses, dogs, and cats.","The present invention also is directed to pharmaceutical formulations and compositions containing combinations of two or more of the active compounds described above. The compounds of the present invention can be prepared (formulated) according to known methods for preparing pharmaceutically useful compositions, whereby active agents are combined in a mixture with a pharmaceutically acceptable carrier(s). For instance, see Gennaro (Ed.), REMINGTON'S PHARMACEUTICAL SCIENCES, 18th ed. (Mack Publishing Co., Easton, Pa., 1990) and GOODMAN AND GILMAN'S THE PHARMACOLOGICAL BASIS OF THERAPEUTICS. A compound and\/or a composition is said to be in a \u201cpharmaceutically acceptable carrier\u201d if its administration can be tolerated by a recipient patient. Sterile phosphate-buffered saline is one example of a pharmaceutically acceptable carrier. Other suitable carriers (e.g., saline and Ringer's solutions) are well known to those skilled in the art (see below).","The pharmaceutically acceptable carrier includes a suitable excipient and\/or auxiliary whose administration is tolerated by the patient. Pharmaceutically acceptable carriers which are known in the art include, but are not limited to, calcium carbonate, calcium phosphate, calcium sulfate, sucrose, dextrose, lactose, fructose, xylitol, sorbitol, starch, starch paste, cellulose derivatives, gelatin, polyvinylpyrrolidone, sodium chloride, dextrins, stearic acid, magnesium stearate, calcium stearate, vegetable oils, polyethylene glycol, sterile phosphate-buffered saline, saline, and Ringer's solutions, and mixtures thereof. See, for example, REMINGTON'S PHARMACEUTICAL SCIENCES, supra.","Pharmaceutically acceptable salts of organic acids (such as amino acids) which have been approved by the U.S. Food and Drug Administration for commercial marketing include sodium, potassium, lithium, zinc, aluminum, calcium, and magnesium salts. See REMINGTON'S PHARMACEUTICAL SCIENCES, 18th ed., page 1445 (Mack Publishing Co. 1990).","The compounds of the present invention and pharmaceutical compositions thereof are formulated as known in the art. For instance, the compound(s) of the present invention may be combined with a pharmaceutically acceptable carrier(s) and processed into a desired dosage form. The pharmaceutical compositions of the present invention may be produced or manufactured in a manner that is itself known, e.g., by means of conventional mixing, dissolving, granulating, dragee-making, levigating, emulsifying, encapsulating, entrapping, or lyophilizing processes which involve both the pharmaceutical composition of interest and its pharmaceutically acceptable carrier.","In general, the dosages of the compounds, formulations, and compositions described herein will vary depending upon such factors as the patient's age, weight, height, sex, general medical condition, and previous medical history. For purposes of therapy, a composition of the present invention and a pharmaceutically acceptable carrier are administered to a subject in need of such treatment in a therapeutically effective amount. The combination of active agents and carrier (formulation or composition) is said to be administered in a \u201ctherapeutically effective amount\u201d if the amount administered is physiologically significant. A pharmaceutical composition is physiologically significant if its presence results in a detectable change in the physiology of a recipient patient. In the present context, for example, an anticonvulsant composition is physiologically significant if the presence of the composition results in the alleviation of one or more symptoms of epilepsy, such as seizures and\/or convulsions. Further, the dose and perhaps dose frequency, will also vary according to the age, body weight, and response of the individual patient. A program comparable to that discussed above may be used in veterinary medicine.","The compounds of the present invention can be administered orally using solid oral dosage forms such as, for example, enteric-coated tablets, caplets, gelcaps, sprinkles, or capsules, or via liquid oral dosage forms such as syrups or elixirs. Unit solid oral dosage forms preferably contain appropriate amounts of active compounds per tablet or capsule such that they can be taken 1-2 at a time for a maximum of two times per day. Liquid formulations can also be employed with active compounds so as to provide 1-2 teaspoonfuls per dose. Furthermore, corresponding reduced dosage pediatric chewable and liquid oral dosage forms can also be prepared and administered. These compounds can also be added to foods and beverages in the form of drops (with a dropper from a \u201cconcentrate\u201d preparation) for oral administration. In addition, the compounds of the present invention may also be formulated into chewing gum to facilitate oral delivery and absorption. Appropriate dosages for each of the compounds used in the formulations and compositions of the present invention can be discerned from the foregoing descriptions by those skilled in the art.","Alternatively, the compounds of the present invention can be administered by injection or other systemic routes, such as transdermal or transmucosal administration, for example, nasally, sublingually, buccally, vaginally, or rectally, via suppositories. Other routes of administration (e.g., useful in veterinary applications) include intestinal and parenteral delivery, including intramuscular, subcutaneous, and\/or intramedullary injections, as well as intrathecal, direct intracerebroventricular, intravenous, intraperitoneal, intranasal, or intraocular injections. Oral administration is much more convenient, however, and therefore is preferred.","The present invention thus contemplates a variety of compounds that are suitable for oral, parenteral, transdermal, transmucosal, intranasal, sublingual, buccal, or rectal administration. It is further understood that the compounds of the present invention can be used in combination with other pharmaceutically active ingredients to prepare still other novel pharmaceutical compositions.","DEMONSTRATING THERAPY-IMPLICATING AND THERAPEUTICALLY RELEVANT ACTIVITY: The suitability and therapeutic effectiveness of a given pharmaceutical formulation or composition for the alleviation of symptoms, as discussed above, can be demonstrated by using the animal models, testing, and screening methods which are described in, e.g., U.S. Pat. Nos. 6,589,994, 6,617,358, and 7,265,155, which are hereby incorporated herein in their entirety.","The therapeutic effects of the compounds of the invention described above, combined with a general lack of toxicity, make the compounds of the present invention ideal agents for the treatment of the conditions described above.

It thus appears that BY is the more potent and effective analgesic enantiomer of H, although both of the enantiomers exhibit significant activity in the mouse formalin pain model.","At a dose of 100 mg\/kg, compound G also exhibited a significant analgesic effect in the sciatic nerve-ligation model in rats, shown by a statistically significant increase of the allodynic threshold (to 275% of the control), especially at 1 hour post-administration. [The response (threshold for foot withdrawal) was measured in grams.] The allodynic threshold was observed to decrease in a time-dependent manner, with the analgesic effect (i.e., an increased allodynic threshold) still evident in the rats at 2 hours (219% of the control) and 4 hours (175% of the control) post-administration.","The mechanisms of action of many currently marketed anticonvulsant drugs are not fully understood. Although numerous molecular targets exist wherein anticonvulsants may exert an effect, the final common pathway appears to be through modulation of voltage-gated and\/or neurotransmitter-gated ion channels. Thus, the common link among the various proposed mechanisms involves the ability of an anticonvulsant to modulate ion channel function. Presently, a number of prototype anticonvulsants are thought to exert their action (at least in part) by reducing sustained, high-frequency repetitive firing of action potentials by modulating voltage-dependent sodium (Na+) channels. The effect of promising candidate substances on voltage-gated Na+ channels can be assessed using state-of-the-art electrophysiological techniques. Mechanism-of-action studies for compound H (at 100 \u03bcM and lower concentrations) indicate the following:\n\n","In connection with the weak antagonist activity seen at NMDA receptors, it is noteworthy that no evidence of psychotomimetic and\/or stereotypical behaviors has been observed in any of the in vivo animal studies that were carried out with the compounds of the present invention, even when high doses were administered [see Kohl, B. K. and G. Dannhardt, \u201cThe NMDA receptor complex: A promising target for novel antiepileptic strategies,\u201d 8 (11 Sep. 2001): 1275-1289].","The effects of compound H (at a concentration of 100 \u03bcM) on sodium currents were evaluated in electrophysiological studies at holding potentials of \u221260 and \u221290 mV (using 8 cells). The observed inhibition of sodium currents by compound H (expressed as % of control \u00b1S.E.M.) was statistically significant, although the overall effect was actually very weak (i.e., 91\u00b11% and 98\u00b11%, respectively). By way of comparison, the % of control inhibited for typical sodium-channel-blocking drugs such as phenyloin or lamotrigine is about 50%. Since, in addition, compound H does not profile like these marketed drugs in the resistant seizure models, it appears that the compound of the invention (H) exerts its unique profile by a combination of mechanisms. This unique profile (including protective activity against both convulsive and non-convulsive seizures induced in the resistant status epilepticus models) further implicates a novel mechanism of action exerted by a unique target (which has not yet been identified) that explains its activity. With regard to possible non-traditional analgesic mechanisms involved in mitigating and relieving chronic neuropathic pain, it is noteworthy that the relatively new analgesic agent, tramadol (Nucynta\u00ae), acts in part as a weak, but fast-acting serotonin and norepinephrine reuptake inhibitor (traditionally antidepressant mechanisms), while several opioids (such as methadone) have NMDA antagonist activity in addition to their g-opioid agonist properties. Other CNS-active compounds which have shown analgesic properties as well as NMDA antagonist activity include the psychotropic agent ketamine, the centrally active potassium-channel opener, flupirtine (with weak NMDA antagonist properties), dextromethorphan, ketobemidone, and possibly piritramide. Furthermore, carbamazepine and oxcarbazepine act principally on sodium channels, tricylic antidepressants may also work on sodium channels in peripheral nerves, and gabapentin and pregabalin work by blocking specific calcium channels on neurons.","Resistance to Lamotrigine can be induced in rats by treating them with the drug during the kindling acquisition phase (i.e., during kindling development in the epileptogenesis phase). Subsequently, the fully kindled Lamotrigine-refractory rats (i.e., now fully manifesting seizures) are also resistant (cross-tolerant) to carbamazepine, phenyloin, and topiramate, but not to valproate (or diazepam or the clinical Phase III drug candidate, retigabine).","The Lamotrigine-resistant amygdala-kindled rat model (LRM) may thus serve as an early model of drug-resistant (i.e., pharmacoresistant, refractory) epilepsy to identify novel AEDs for further evaluation in more extensive model systems, including the phenyloin-resistant kindled rat [see Engel, J., T. A. Pedley, J. Aicardi, and M. A. Dichter (Eds.), 1, 2ed., Lippincott, Williams and Wilkins, 2007, p. 1477].","The LRM thus serves to identify novel broad-spectrum AEDs which may be effective in the treatment of drug-resistant epilepsies. Up to 35% of epilepsy patients continue to suffer from uncontrolled seizures because of their drug-resistant epilepsies. In such cases, the patients do not respond to standard AEDs such as lamotrigine (Lamictal\u00ae), carbamazepine (Tegretol\u00ae), phenyloin (Dilantin\u00ae), and topiramate (Topamax\u00ae).","The only currently marketed AED which is effective in this animal model (LRM) is the very broad-spectrum agent, valproate. Since compound H is also active in the LRM, it thus shares valproate's wide-ranging anticonvulsant and antiepileptic activities.","The Gender Neutral test demonstrates the differences between the genders in the way that they respond to AEDs. In this test, compound H was found to be equally efficacious in both genders, unlike, e.g., phenyloin (Dilantin\u00ae) which is significantly less effective in male kindled rats than it is in female kindled rats [see Ebert, U., C. Rundfeldt, and W. Loscher, \u201cSex differences in the anticonvulsant efficacy of phenyloin in amygdala-kindled rats,\u201d 638(1-2; 28 February): 45-52 (1994)].","Out of eight human CYP-450 enzymes tested, compound H has either no or only a remote possibility of inhibiting four of the tested enzymes (3A4, 2E1, 2B6 and 1A2). On the other hand, it is an inhibitor for 2C19, 2D6, 2A6 and 2C9. The Ki values range from 29 to 174 \u03bcM.","The present invention may be embodied in other specific forms without departing from its spirit or essential characteristics.
