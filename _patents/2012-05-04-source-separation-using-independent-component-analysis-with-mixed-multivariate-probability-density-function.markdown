More specifically, embodiments of the present invention are directed to audio signal processing and source separation methods and apparatus utilizing independent component analysis (ICA).","Source separation has attracted attention in a variety of applications where it may be desirable to extract a set of original source signals from a set of mixed signal observations.","Source separation may find use in a wide variety of signal processing applications, such as audio signal processing, optical signal processing, speech separation, neural imaging, stock market prediction, telecommunication systems, facial recognition, and more. Where knowledge of the mixing process of original signals that produces the mixed signals is not known, the problem has commonly been referred to as blind source separation (BSS).","Independent component analysis (ICA) is an approach to the source separation problem that models the mixing process as linear mixtures of original source signals, and applies a de-mixing operation that attempts to reverse the mixing process to produce a set of estimated signals corresponding to the original source signals. Basic ICA assumes linear instantaneous mixtures of non-Gaussian source signals, with the number of mixtures equal to the number of source signals. Because the original source signals are assumed to be independent, ICA estimates the original source signals by using statistical methods extract a set of independent (or at least maximally independent) signals from the mixtures.","While conventional ICA approaches for simplified, instantaneous mixtures in the absence of noise can give very good results, real world source separation applications often need to account for a more complex mixing process created by real world environments. A common example of the source separation problem as it applies to speech separation is demonstrated by the well-known \u201ccocktail party problem,\u201d in which several persons are speaking in a room and an array of microphones are used to detect speech signals from the separate speakers. The goal of ICA would be to extract the individual speech signals of the speakers from the mixed observations detected by the microphones; however, the mixing process may be complicated by a variety of factors, including noises, music, moving sources, room reverberations, echoes, and the like. In this manner, each microphone in the array may detect a unique mixed signal that contains a mixture of the original source signals (i.e. the mixed signal that is detected by each microphone in the array includes a mixture of the separate speakers' speech), but the mixed signals may not be simple instantaneous mixtures of just the sources. Rather, the mixtures can be convolutive mixtures, resulting from room reverberations and echoes (e.g. speech signals bouncing off room walls), and may include any of the complications to the mixing process mentioned above.","Mixed signals to be used for source separation can initially be time domain representations of the mixed observations (e.g. in the cocktail part problem mentioned above, they would be mixed audio signals as functions of time). ICA processes have been developed to perform the source separation on time-domain signals from convolutive mixed signals and can give good results; however, the separation of convolutive mixtures of time domain signals can be very computationally intensive, requiring lots of time and processing resources and thus prohibiting its effective utilization in many common real world ICA applications.","A much more computationally efficient algorithm can be implemented by extracting frequency data from the observed time domain signals. In doing this, the convolutive operation in the time domain is replaced by a more computationally efficient multiplication operation in the frequency domain. A Fourier-related transform, such as a short-time Fourier transform (STFT), can be performed on the time-domain data in order to generate frequency representations of the observed mixed signals and load frequency bins, whereby the STFT converts the time domain signals into the time-frequency domain. A STFT can generate a spectrogram for each time segment analyzed, providing information about the intensity of each frequency bin at each time instant in a given time segment.","Although the STFT is referred to herein as an example of a Fourier-related transform, the term \u201cFourier-related transform\u201d is not so limited. In general, the term \u201cFourier-related transform\u201d refers to a linear transform of functions related to Fourier analysis. Such transformations map a function to a set of coefficients of basis functions, which are typically sinusoidal and are therefore strongly localized in the frequency spectrum. Examples of Fourier-related transforms applied to continuous arguments include the Laplace transform, the two-sided Laplace transform, the Mellin transform, Fourier transforms including Fourier series and sine and cosine transforms, the short-time Fourier transform (STFT), the fractional Fourier transform, the Hartley transform, the Chirplet transform and the Hankel transform. Examples of Fourier-related transforms applied to discrete arguments include the discrete Fourier transform (DFT), the discrete time Fourier transform (DTFT), the discrete sine transform (DST), the discrete cosine transform (DCT), regressive discrete Fourier series, discrete Chebyshev transforms, the generalized discrete Fourier transform (GDFT), the Z-transform, the modified discrete cosine transform, the discrete Hartley transform, the discretized STFT, and the Hadamard transform (or Walsh function). The transformation of time domain signal to spectrum domain representation can also been done by means of wavelet analysis or functional analysis that is applied to single dimension time domain speech signal, we will still call the transformation as Fourier-related transform for the simplicity of the patent. Traditional approaches to frequency domain ICA involve performing the independent component analysis at each frequency bin (i.e. independence of the same frequency bin between different signals will be maximized). Unfortunately, this approach inherently suffers from a well-known permutation problem, which can cause estimated frequency bin data of the source signals to be grouped in incorrect sources. As such, when resulting time domain signals are reproduced from the frequency domain signals (such as by an inverse STFT), each estimated time domain signal that is produced from the separation process may contain frequency data from incorrect sources.","Various approaches to solving the misalignment of frequency bins in source separation by frequency domain ICA have been proposed. However, to date none of these approaches achieve high enough performance in real world noisy environments to make them an attractive solution for acoustic source separation applications.","Conventional approaches include performing frequency domain ICA at each frequency bin as described above and applying post-processing that involves correcting the alignment of frequency bins by various methods. However, these approaches can suffer from inaccuracies and poor performance in the correcting step. Additionally, because these processes require an additional processing step after the initial ICA separation, processing time and computing resources required to produce the estimated source signals are greatly increased.","Other approaches attempt to address the permutation problem more directly by performing the ICA at all frequency bins collectively. One such approach is disclosed in Hiroe, U.S. Pat. No. 7,797,153 (hereinafter Hiroe), the entire disclosure of which is herein incorporated by reference. Hiroe discloses a method in which the ICA calculations are performed on entire spectrograms as opposed to individual frequency bins, thereby attempting to prevent the permutation problem that occurs when ICA is performed at each frequency bin. Hiroe sets up a score function that uses a multivariate probability density function (PDF) to account for the relationship between frequency bins in the separation process.","However, because the approaches of Hiroe above model the relationship between frequency bins with a singular multivariate PDF, they fail to account for the different statistical properties of different sources as well as a change in the statistical properties of a source signal over time. As a result, they suffer from poor performance when attempting to analyze a wide time frame. Furthermore, the approaches are generally unable to effectively analyze multi-source speech signals (i.e. multiple speakers in the same location at the same time), because the underlying singular PDF is inadequate for both sources.","To date, known approaches to frequency domain ICA suffer from one or more of the following drawbacks: inability to accurately align frequency bins with the appropriate source, requirement of a post-processing that requires extra time and processing resources, poor performance (i.e. poor signal to noise ratio), inability to efficiently analyze multi-source speech, requirement of position information for microphones, and a requirement for a limited time frame to be analyzed.","For the foregoing reasons, there is a need for methods and apparatus that can efficiently implement frequency domain independent component analysis to produce estimated source signals from a set of mixed signals without the aforementioned drawbacks. It is within this context that a need for the present invention arises.","The following description will describe embodiments of the present invention primarily with respect to the processing of audio signals detected by a microphone array. More particularly, embodiments of the present invention will be described with respect to the separation of speech source signals or other audio source signals from mixed audio signals that are detected by a microphone array. However, it is to be understood that ICA has many far reaching applications in a wide variety of technologies, including optical signal processing, neural imaging, stock market prediction, telecommunication systems, facial recognition, and more. Mixed signals can be obtained from a variety of sources, preferably by being observed from array of sensors or transducers that are capable of observing the signals of interest into electronic form for processing by a communications device or other signal processing device. Accordingly, the accompanying claims are not to be limited to speech separation applications or microphone arrays except where explicitly recited in the claims.","In order to address the permutation problem described above, a separation process utilizing ICA can define relationships between frequency bins according to multivariate probability density functions. In this manner, the permutation problem can be substantially avoided by accounting for the relationship between frequency bins in the source separation process and thereby preventing misalignment of the frequency bins as described above.","The parameters for each multivariate PDF that appropriately estimates the relationship between frequency bins can depend not only on the source signal to which it corresponds, but also the time frame to be analyzed (i.e. the parameters of a PDF for a given source signal will depend on the time frame of that signal that is analyzed). As such, the parameters of a multivariate PDF that appropriately models the relationship between frequency bins can be considered to be both time dependent and source dependent. However, it is noted that the general form of the multivariate PDF can be the same for the same types of sources, regardless of which source or time segment that corresponds to the multivariate PDF. For example, all sources over all time segments can have multivariate PDFs with super-Gaussian form corresponding to speech signals, but the parameters for each source and time segment can be different. Known approaches to frequency domain ICA that utilize probability density functions to model the relationship between frequency bins fail to account for these different parameters by modeling a single multivariate PDF in the ICA calculation.","Embodiments of the present invention can account for the different statistical properties of different sources as well as the same source over different time segments by using weighted mixtures of component multivariate probability density functions having different parameters in the ICA calculation. The parameters of these mixtures of multivariate probability density functions, or mixed multivariate PDFs, can be weighted for different source signals, different time segments, or some combination thereof. In other words, the parameters of the component probability density functions in the mixed multivariate PDFs can correspond to the frequency components of different sources and\/or different time segments to be analyzed.","Accordingly, embodiments of the present invention are able to analyze a much wider time frame with better performance than known processes as well as account for multiple speakers in the same location at the same time (i.e. multi-source speech).","In the description that follows, models corresponding to known ICA processes utilizing single multivariate PDFs in the ICA calculation will be first be explained to aid in the understanding of the present invention and to provide a proper set up for models that correspond to embodiments of the present invention. New models that use mixed multivariate PDFs according to embodiments of the present invention will then be explained.","Source Separation Problem Set Up","Referring to , a basic schematic of a source separation process having N separate signal sources  is depicted. Signals from sources  can be represented by the column vector s=[s, s, . . . , s]. It is noted that the superscript T simply indicates that the column vector s is simply the transpose of the row vector [s, s, . . . , s]. Note that each source signal can be a function modeled as a continuously random variable (e.g. a speech signal as a function of time), but for now the function variables are omitted for simplicity. The sources  are observed by M separate sensors , producing M different mixed signals which can be represented by the vector x=[x, x, . . . , x]. Source separation  separates the mixed signals x=[x, x, . . . , x]received from the sensors  to produce estimated source signals , which can be represented by the vector y=[y, y, . . . , y]and which correspond to the source signals from signal sources . Source separation as shown generally in  can produce the estimated source signals y=[y, y, . . . , y]that correspond to the original sources  without information of the mixing process that produces the mixed signals observed by the sensors x=[x, x, . . . , x].","Referring to , a basic schematic of a general ICA operation to perform source separation as shown in  is depicted. In a basic ICA process, the number of sources  is equal to the number of sensors , such that M=N and the number observed mixed signals is equal to the number of separate source signals to be reproduced. Before being observed by sensors , the source signals s emanating from sources  are subjected to unknown mixing  in the environment before being observed by the sensors .

Signal processing  can include receiving M mixed signals . Receiving mixed signals  can be accomplished by observing signals of interest with an array of M sensors or transducers such as a microphone array having M microphones that convert observed audio signals into electronic form for processing by a signal processing device. The signal processing device can perform embodiments of the methods described herein and, by way of example, can be an electronic communications device such as a computer, handheld electronic device, videogame console, or electronic processing device. The microphone array can produce mixed signals x(t), . . . , x(t) that can be represented by the time domain mixed signal vector x(t). Each component of the mixed signal vector x(t) can include a convolutive mixture of audio source signals to be separated, with the convolutive mixing process cause by echoes, reverberation, time delays, etc.","If signal processing  is to be performed digitally, signal processing  can include converting the mixed signals x(t) to digital form with an analog to digital converter (ADC). The analog to digital conversion  will utilize a sampling rate sufficiently high to enable processing of the highest frequency component of interest in the underlying source signal. Analog to digital conversion  can involve defining a sampling window that defines the length of time segments for signals to be input into the ICA separation process. By way of example, a rolling sampling window can be used to generate a series of time segments converted into the time-frequency domain. The sampling window can be chosen according to various application specific requirements, as well as available resources, processing power, etc.","In order to perform frequency domain independent component analysis according to embodiments of the present invention, a Fourier-related transform , preferably STFT, can be performed on the time domain signals to convert them to time-frequency representations for processing by signal processing . STFT will load frequency bins  for each time segment and mixed signal on which frequency domain ICA will be performed. Loaded frequency bins can correspond to spectrogram representations of each time-frequency domain mixed signal for each time segment.","In order to simplify the mathematical operations to be performed in frequency domain ICA, in embodiments of the present invention, signal processing  can include preprocessing  of the time frequency domain signal X(f, t), which can include well known preprocessing operations such as centering, whitening, etc. Preprocessing can include de-correlating the mixed signals by principal component analysis (PCA) prior to performing the source separation .","Signal separation  by frequency domain ICA can be performed iteratively in conjunction with optimization . Source separation  involves setting up a de-mixing matrix operation W that produces maximally independent estimated source signals Y of original source signals S when the de-mixing matrix is applied to mixed signals X corresponding to those received by . Source separation  incorporates optimization process  to iteratively update the de-mixing matrix involved in source separation  until the de-mixing matrix converges to a solution that produces maximally independent estimates of source signals. Optimization  incorporates an optimization algorithm or learning rule that defines the iterative process until the de-mixing matrix converges. By way of example, signal separation  in conjunction with optimization  can use an expectation maximization algorithm (EM algorithm) to estimate the parameters of the component probability density functions.","In some implementations, the cost function may be defined using an estimation method, such as Maximum a Posteriori (MAP) or Maximum Likelihood (ML). The solution to the signal separation problem can them be found using a method such as EM, a Gradient method, and the like. By way of example, and not by way of limitation, the cost function of independence may be defined using ML and optimized using EM. Once estimates of source signals are produced by separation process (e.g. after the de-mixing matrix converges), rescaling and possibly additional single channel spectrum domain speech enhancement (post processing)  can be performed to produce accurate time-frequency representations of estimated source signals required due to simplifying pre-processing step .","In order to produce estimated sources signals y(t) in the time domain that directly correspond to the original time domain source signals s(t), signal processing  can further include performing an inverse Fourier transform  (e.g. inverse STFT) on the time-frequency domain estimated source signals Y(f, t) to produce time domain estimated source signals y(t). Estimated time domain source signals can be reproduced or utilized in various applications after digital to analog conversion . By way of example, estimated time domain source signals can be reproduced by speakers, headphones, etc. after digital to analog conversion, or can be stored digitally in a non-transitory computer readable medium for other uses. The Fourier transform process  and digital to analog conversion process are optional and need not be implemented, e.g., if the spectrum output of the rescaling  and optional single channel spectrum domain speech enhancement  is converted directly to a speech recognition feature.","Models","Signal processing  utilizing source separation  and optimization  by frequency domain ICA as described above can involve appropriate models for the arithmetic operations to be performed by a signal processing device according to embodiments of the present invention. In the following description, first old models will be described that utilize multivariate PDFs in frequency domain ICA operations, but do not utilize mixed multivariate PDFs. New models will then be described that utilize mixed multivariate PDFs according to embodiments of the present invention. While the models described herein are provided for complete and clear disclosure of embodiments of the present invention, persons having ordinary skill in the art can conceive of various alterations of the following models without departing from the scope of the present invention.","Model Using Multivariate PDFs","A model for performing source separation  and optimization  using frequency domain ICA as shown in  will first be described according to known approaches that utilize singular multivariate PDFs.","In order to perform frequency domain ICA, frequency domain data must be extracted from the time domain mixed signals, and this can be accomplished by performing a Fourier-related transform on the mixed signal data. For example, a short-time Fourier transform (STFT) can convert the time domain signals x(t) into time-frequency domain signals, such that,\n\n()=(())\u2003\u2003(4)\n\nand for F number of frequency bins, the spectrum of the mmicrophone will be,\n\n()=[(1) . . .

It is noted that the separate source signals can be expected to have PDFs with the same general form (e.g. separate speech signals can be expected to have PDFs of super-Gaussian form), but the parameters from the different source signals can be expected to be different. Additionally, because the signal from a particular source will change over time, the parameters of the PDF for a signal from the same source can be expected to have different parameters at different time segments. Accordingly, embodiments of the present invention utilize mixed multivariate PDFs that are mixtures of PDFs weighted for different sources and\/or different time segments. Accordingly, embodiments of the present invention can utilize a mixed multivariate PDF that can accounts for the different statistical properties of different source signals as well as the change of statistical properties of a signal over time.","As such, for a mixture of L different component multivariate PDFs, L can generally be understood to be the product of the number of time segments and the number of sources for which the mixed PDF is weighted (e.g. L=number of sources\u00d7number of time segments).","Embodiments of the present invention can utilize pre-trained eigenvectors to estimate of the de-mixing matrix.

By way of example, the form of PDF chosen can be spherical. More specifically, the form can be super-Gaussian, Laplacian, or Gaussian, depending on various application specific requirements. It is noted that each mixed multivariate PDF is a mixture of component PDFs, and each component PDF in the mixture can have the same form but different parameters.","A mixed multivariate PDF may result in a probability density function having a plurality of modes corresponding to each component PDF as shown in . In the singular PDF  in , the probability density as a function of a given variable is uni-modal, i.e., a graph of the PDF  with respect to a given variable has only one peak. In the mixed PDF  the probability density as a function of a given variable is multi-modal, i.e., the graph of the mixed PDF  with respect to a given variable has more than one peak. It is noted that  is provided as a demonstration of the difference between a singular PDF  and a mixed PDF . Note, however, that the PDFs depicted in  are univariate PDFs and are merely provided to demonstrate the difference between a singular PDF and a mixed PDF. In mixed multivariate PDFs there would be more than one variable and the PDF would be multi-modal with respect to one or more of those variables. In other words, there could be more than one peak in a graph of the PDF with respect to at least one of the variables.  illustrates another way of envisioning the difference between a singular multivariate PDF and a mixed multivariate PDF is shown in the spectral plot depicted in. In , singular multivariate PDF a) denoted P(Y(t)) and a mixed multivariate PDF b) denoted P(Y(t)).

Although the program code  is described herein as being implemented in software and executed upon a general purpose computer, those skilled in the art may realize that the method of task management could alternatively be implemented using hardware such as an application specific integrated circuit (ASIC) or other hardware circuitry. As such, embodiments of the invention may be implemented, in whole or in part, in software, hardware or some combination of both.","An embodiment of the present invention may include program code  having a set of processor readable instructions that implement source separation methods as described above. The program code  may generally include instructions that direct the processor to perform source separation on a plurality of time domain mixed signals, where the mixed signals include mixtures of original source signals to be extracted by the source separation methods described herein. The instructions may direct the signal processing device  to perform a Fourier-related transform (e.g. STFT) on a plurality of time domain mixed signals to generate time-frequency domain mixed signals corresponding to the time domain mixed signals and thereby load frequency bins. The instructions may direct the signal processing device to perform independent component analysis as described above on the time-frequency domain mixed signals to generate estimated source signals corresponding to the original source signals. The independent component analysis will utilize mixed multivariate probability density functions that are weighted mixtures of component probability density functions of frequency bins corresponding to different source signals and\/or different time segments.","It is noted that the methods of source separation described herein generally apply to estimating multiple source signals from mixed signals that are received by a signal processing device. It may be, however, that in a particular application the only source signal of interest is a single source signal, such as a single speech signal mixed with other source signals that are noises. By way of example, a source signal estimated by audio signal processing embodiments of the present invention may be a speech signal, a music signal, or noise. As such, embodiments of the present invention can utilize ICA as described above in order to estimate at least one source signal from a mixture of a plurality of original source signals.","Although the detailed description herein contains many specific details for the purposes of illustration, anyone of ordinary skill in the art will appreciate that many variations and alterations to the details described herein are within the scope of the invention. Accordingly, the exemplary embodiments of the invention described herein are set forth without any loss of generality to, and without imposing limitations upon, the claimed invention.","While the above is a complete description of the preferred embodiments of the present invention, it is possible to use various alternatives, modifications and equivalents. Therefore, the scope of the present invention should be determined not with reference to the above description but should, instead, be determined with reference to the appended claims, along with their full scope of equivalents. Any feature described herein, whether preferred or not, may be combined with any other feature described herein, whether preferred or not. In the claims that follow, the indefinite article \u201ca\u201d, or \u201can\u201d when used in claims containing an open-ended transitional phrase, such as \u201ccomprising,\u201d refers to a quantity of one or more of the item following the article, except where expressly stated otherwise. Furthermore, the later use of the word \u201csaid\u201d or \u201cthe\u201d to refer back to the same claim term does not change this meaning, but simply re-invokes that non-singular meaning. The appended claims are not to be interpreted as including means-plus-function limitations or step-plus-function limitations, unless such a limitation is explicitly recited in a given claim using the phrase \u201cmeans for\u201d or \u201cstep for.\u201d"],"brief-description-of-drawings":[{},{}],"description-of-drawings":{"heading":"BRIEF DESCRIPTION OF THE DRAWINGS","p":["The teachings of the present invention can be readily understood by considering the following detailed description in conjunction with the accompanying drawings, in which:",{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0018","num":"0017"},"figref":"FIG. 1A"},{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0019","num":"0018"},"figref":"FIG. 1B"},{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0020","num":"0019"},"figref":"FIG. 2"},{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0021","num":"0020"},"figref":"FIG. 3A"},{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0022","num":"0021"},"figref":"FIG. 3B"},{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0023","num":"0022"},"figref":"FIG. 4"}]},"DETDESC":[{},{}]}
