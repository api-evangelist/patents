No. 11\/985,981, filed Nov. 19, 2007, which is a divisional application of non-provisional application U.S. Ser. No. 10\/842,313, filed May 10, 2004, now U.S. Pat. No. 7,344,882, which claims benefit to provisional application U.S. Ser. No. 60\/469,894 filed May 12, 2003; under 35 U.S.C. 119(e). The entire teachings of the referenced application are incorporated herein by reference.","The present invention provides novel polynucleotides encoding LTRPC3 polypeptides, fragments and homologues thereof. The present invention also provides polynucleotides encoding variants of LTRPC3 polypeptides, specifically LTRPC3g, LTRPC3h, LTRPC3i, LTRPC3j, LTRPC3k, and LTRPC3l. Also provided are vectors, host cells, antibodies, and recombinant and synthetic methods for producing said polypeptides. The invention further relates to diagnostic and therapeutic methods for applying these novel LTRPC3g, LTRPC3h, LTRPC3i, LTRPC3j, LTRPC3k, and LTRPC3l polypeptides to the diagnosis, treatment, and\/or prevention of various diseases and\/or disorders related to these polypeptides. The invention further relates to screening methods for identifying agonists and antagonists of the polynucleotides and polypeptides of the present invention.","Intracellular Ca plays a pivotal role in various cell functions, ranging from exocytosis and contraction to gene expression and cell differentiation, proliferation and apoptosis. Ca entry into cells, particularly in non-excitable cells, can be mediated via store-operated Ca channel (s) (SOC). Following Ca release from the intracellular stores, SOC mediate Ca influx from the extracellular space to generate sustained increases in intracellular Ca concentration and replenish the internal Ca stores. The molecular mechanism of SOC activation and the molecular identity of SOC remains elusive. Members of TRP (Transient Receptor Potential) channels, an emerging class of Ca-permeable cation channel superfamily, are likely candidates for SOC (reviewed in 23, 159-166, (2000)).","Human mutations in the genes involved in intracellular Ca handling result in visual defects, diabetes mellitus, disorders in the skin, skeletal-muscle, nervous, cardiac and vascular systems (reviewed by Missiaen et al., 2000). In addition to the well characterized voltage-dependent Ca channels, Ca pumps and Ca-permeable ligand-gated channels, TRPC (Transient Receptor Potential Channels) is an emerging class of Ca-permeable cation channel superfamily. All of the channels in this family contain a six-trans-membrane domain although various cellular mechanisms have been implicated in their functions.","Following the identification of the founding member of this family, dTRP, from the mutants trp whose photoreceptors failed to generate a sustained receptor potential in response to intense sustained light (8, 643-651, (1992)), mammalian homologues have been cloned and all of them contain a six-trans-membrane domain followed by a TRP motif (XWKFXR, SEQ ID NO:168), the diagnosed feature of the TRP family of proteins. The mutant fly showed a reduced Ca selectivity of the light response and the channel activity of dTRP depended on PLC activation was also demonstrated.","Based on their homology, they are divided into three subfamilies: short (s), osm (o) and long (l). New nomenclature for each subfamily has recently been proposed and is as follows: TRPC (canonical), TRPV (vanilloid), and TRPM (melastatin) (9, 229-231, (2002)). The sTRPC subfamily includes TRP1-7. Although the specific physiological function of each isoform remains to be assigned, it is generally believed that they may be involved in Ca entry after activation of receptors coupling to PLC. The TRP2 is specifically expressed in vomeronasal organ and involved in pheromone sensory signaling (Liman, et al., 1999). TRP1 and TRP6 are functioned in vascular smooth muscle cells and may play a role in controlling smooth muscle tone, arteriosclerosis and neointimal hypoerplasia (Inoue et al., 2001; Xu & Beech, 2001). It has been shown that TRP4\u2212\/\u2212 mice lack an endothelial store-operated Ca current, which leads to reduced agonist-dependent vasorelaxation (Freichel et al., 2001).","The first member of oTRPC Subfamily is OSM-9 cloned from . It is involved in responses to odorants, high osmotic strength, and mechanical stimulation. Recently, several mammalian homologues including vanilloid receptor (VR1) and vanilloid receptor-like receptor (VRL-1), which may have functions in pain and heat perception (Caterina, 1999; Caterina et al., 2000). VR1 has also been shown to be the receptor of anandamide and mediating its vasodilation effect (Zygmunt et al., 1999). OTRPC4 is an osmotically activated channel and a candidate osmoreceptor, may be involved in regulation of cellular volume (Strotmann et al., 2000). CaT1 & ECaC1 may be the calcium-release-activated calcium channel and involved in Ca reabsorption in intestine and kidney (Peng, et al, 1999; Yu et al., 2001).","The function of the 1TRPC is less clear. The cloned mammalian 1TRPC includes melastatin1\/MLSN1\/LTRPC1, MTR1\/LTRPC5, TRPC7\/LTRPC2 and TRP-P8. It is known that melastatin 1 is down regulated in metastatic melanomas (Duncan et al., 1998) and MTR1 is associated with Beckwith-Wiedemann syndrome and a predisposition to neoplasias (Prawitt et al., 2000). TRPC7 is mapped to the chromosome region linked to bipolar affective disorder, nonsyndromic hereditary deafness, Knobloch syndrome and holosencephaly (Nagamine et al., 1998). TRP-P8 is a prostate-specific gene and up-regulated in prostate cancer and other malignancies (Tsavaler et al., 2001). A recently cloned TRP-PLIK\/hSOC-2\/hCRAC-1 exhibits a very interesting feature in that it is a bi-functional protein with kinase and ion channel activities (Runnels et al., 2001). Additionally, a very long TRPC homologue NOMPC was found in and . NOMPC was identified as a mechanosensitive channel that can detect sound, pressure or movement changes (Walker et al., 2000).","Members of the TRPM subfamily are characteristic of their unusually long cytoplasmic tails at both ends of the channel domain and some of the family members contain an enzyme domain at the C-terminal region. Despite their similarities of structure, TRPMs have been implicated in a variety of biological functions. TRPM1 is found to be down-regulated in metastatic melanomas (58, 1515-1520, (1998)). TRPM2 is a Ca-permeable channel that contains an ADP-ribose pyrophosphatase domain and can be activated by ADP-ribose, NAD (411, 595-599, (2001); and 293, 1327-1330, (2001)) and changes in redox status (9, 163-173, (2002)). TRPM2 is mapped to the chromosome region linked to bipolar affective disorder, nonsyndromic hereditary deafness, Knobloch syndrome and holosencephaly (54, 124-131, (1998)). Two splice variants of TRPM4 have been described. TRPM4a is predominantly a Ca permeable channel (98, 10692-10697, (2001); whereas TRPM4b conducts monovalent cations upon activation by changes in intracellular Ca (109, 397-401, (2002)). TRPM5 is associated with Beckwith-Wiedemann syndrome and a predisposition to neoplasias (9, 203-216, (2001)). TRPM7, another bi-functional protein, has kinase activity in additional to its ion channel activity. TRPM7 is regulated by Mg-ATP and\/or PIP, and required for cell viability (291, 1043-1047, (2001); 411, 690-695, (2001); and 4, 329-36, (2002)). TRPM8 is up-regulated in prostate cancer and other malignancies (61, 3760-3769, (2001)). Recently, it has also been shown to be a receptor that senses cold stimuli (416, 52-58, (2002); and 108, 705-715, (2002)).","As described herein, the polypeptides of the present invention are novel variants of the LTRPC3 polypeptide. The LTRPC3 polypeptide is described in U.S. Ser. No. 10\/210,152, filed Aug. 1, 2002; and International Publication No. WO 03\/012063, published Feb. 13, 2003; in addition to U.S. Ser. No. 10\/405,793, filed Mar. 28, 2003) which are hereby incorporated by reference in its entirety.","Characterization of the LTRPC3 polypeptide led to the determination that it is involved in the modulation of the FEN1 DNA base-excision repair\/proliferation modulating protein, either directly or indirectly.","In mammalian cells, single-base lesions, such as uracil and abasic sites, appear to be repaired by at least two base excision repair (BER) subpathways: \u201csingle-nucleotide BER\u201d requiring DNA synthesis of just one nucleotide and \u201clong patch BER\u201d requiring multi-nucleotide DNA synthesis. In single-nucleotide BER, DNA polymerase beta (beta-pol) accounts for both gap filling DNA synthesis and removal of the 5\u2032-deoxyribose phosphate (dRP) of the abasic site, whereas the involvement of various DNA polymerases in long patch BER is less well understood.","Flap endonuclease 1 (Fen1) is a structure-specific metallonuclease that plays an essential function in DNA replication and DNA repair (Tom, S., Henricksen, L, A., Bambara, R, A, J. Biol, Chem., 275(14):10498-505, (2000)). It interacts like many other proteins involved in DNA metabolic events with proliferating cell nuclear antigen (PCNA), and its enzymatic activity is stimulated by PCNA in vitro by as much as 5 to 50 fold (Stucki, M., Jonsson, Z, O., Hubscher, U, J. Biol, Chem., 276(11):7843-9, (2001)). Recently, immunodepletion experiments in human lymphoid cell extracts have shown long-patch BER to be dependent upon FEN1 (Prasad, R., Dia, G, L., Bohr, V, A., Wilson, S, H, J. Biol, Chem., 275(6):4460-6, (2000)). In addition, FEN1 has also been shown to cooperate with beta-pol in long patch BER excision and is involved in determining the predominant excision product seen in cell extracts. The substrate for FEN1 is a flap formed by natural 5\u2032-end displacement of the short intermediates of lagging strand replication. FEN1 binds to the 5\u2032-end of the flap, tracks to the point of annealing at the base of the flap, and then cleaves the substrate (Tom, S., Henricksen, L, A., Bambara, R, A, J. Biol, Chem., 275(14):10498-505, (2000)).","The FEN1 is also referred to as Rad27. FEN1 plays a critical role in base-excision repair as evidenced by FEN1 null mutants displaying an enhancement in recombination that increases as sequence length decreases (Negritto, M, C., Qiu, J., Ratay, D, O., Shen, B., Bailis, A, M, Mol, Cell, Biol., 21(7):2349-58, (2001)). The latter suggests that Rad27 preferentially restricts recombination between short sequences. Since wild-type alleles of both RAD27 and its human homologue FEN1 complement the elevated short-sequence recombination (SSR) phenotype of a rad27-null mutant, this function may be conserved from yeast to humans. Furthermore, mutant Rad27 and FEN-1 enzymes with partial flap endonuclease activity but without nick-specific exonuclease activity were shown to partially complement the SSR phenotype of the rad27-null mutant suggesting that the endonuclease activity of Rad27 (FEN-1) plays a role in limiting recombination between short sequences in eukaryotic cells. In addition, preliminary data from yeast suggests the FEN-1 deficiencies may result in genomic instability (Ma, X., Jin, Q., Forsti, A., Hemminki, K., Ku, R, Int, J. Cancer., 88(6):938-42, (2000)). More recently, FEN1 null mutants results in the expansion of repetitive sequences (Henricksen, L, A., Tom, S., Liu, Y., Bambara, R, A, J. Biol, Chem., 275(22):16420-7, (2000)).","Aside from the role of FEN1 in base-excision repair, FEN1 has also been shown to play a significant role in modulating signal transduction in proliferating cells. This role is intricately associated with the role of FEN1 in DNA replication. Of particular significance is the observation that FEN1 is a nuclear antigen, that it is expressed by cycling cells, and that it co-localizes with PCNA and polymerase alpha during S phase. Fen1 expression is topologically regulated in vivo and is associated with proliferative populations (Warbrick, E., Coates, P, J., Hall, P, A, J. Pathol., 186(3):319-24, (1998)). Antibodies have been described by Warbrick et al. that specifically bind FEN1, the assays of which are hereby incorporated herein by reference.","In addition, experiments in using the novel immunosuppressant agent SR 31747 have shown that SR 31747 arrests cell proliferation by directly targeting sterol isomerase and that FEN1 is required to mediate the proliferation arrest induced by ergosterol depletion (Silve, S., Leplatois, P., Josse, A., Dupuy, P, H., Lanau, C., Kaghad, M., Dhers, C., Picard, C., Rahier, A., Taton, M., Le, Fur, G., Caput, D., Ferrara, P., Loison, G, Mol, Cell, Biol., 16(6):2719-27, (1996)).","Using the above examples, it is clear the availability of a novel cloned transient receptor potential channel family provides an opportunity for adjunct or replacement therapy, and are useful for the identification of transient receptor potential channel agonists, or stimulators (which might stimulate and\/or bias transient receptor potential channel function), as well as, in the identification of transient receptor potential channel inhibitors. All of which might be therapeutically useful under different circumstances.","The present invention also relates to recombinant vectors, which include the isolated nucleic acid molecules of the present invention, and to host cells containing the recombinant vectors, as well as to methods of making such vectors and host cells, in addition to their use in the production of LTRPC3g, LTRPC3h, LTRPC3i, LTRPC3j, LTRPC3k, and LTRPC3l polypeptides using recombinant techniques.

Each of the LTRPC3 variants of the present invention shares significant homology with other transient receptor potential channel family members, such as human melatonin receptor 1. Transcripts for the LTRPC3 variant were found predominately in kidney, spinal cord, testis, and brain suggesting that the invention potentially modulates leukocyte proliferation, differentiation, migration, and activation in these tissues. Since the polynucleotides of the present invention represent what is believed to be the full-length variants of the LTRPC3 polynucleotide, the polynucleotide variants of the present invention have been tentatively named LTRPC3g, LTRPC3h, LTRPC3i, LTRPC3j, LTRPC3k, and LTRPC3l, which are distinguished from the LTRPC3 splice variants LTRPC3b, LTRPC3c, LTRPC3d, LTRPC3e, and LTRPC3f which are also disclosed in U.S. Ser.

For example, an isolated polynucleotide could be part of a vector or a composition of matter, or could be contained within a cell, and still be \u201cisolated\u201d because that vector, composition of matter, or particular cell is not the original environment of the polynucleotide. The term \u201cisolated\u201d does not refer to genomic or cDNA libraries, whole cell total or mRNA preparations, genomic DNA preparations (including those separated by electrophoresis and transferred onto blots), sheared whole cell genomic DNA preparations or other compositions where the art demonstrates no distinguishing features of the polynucleotide\/sequences of the present invention.","In specific embodiments, the polynucleotides of the invention are at least 15, at least 30, at least 50, at least 100, at least 125, at least 155, at least 500, or at least 1000 continuous nucleotides but are less than or equal to 300 kb, 200 kb, 100 kb, 50 kb, 15 kb, 10 kb, 7.5 kb, 5 kb, 2.5 kb, 2.0 kb, or 1 kb, in length. In a further embodiment, polynucleotides of the invention comprise a portion of the coding sequences, as disclosed herein, but do not comprise all or a portion of any intron. In another embodiment, the polynucleotides comprising coding sequences do not contain coding sequences of a genomic flanking gene (i.e., 5\u2032 or 3\u2032 to the gene of interest in the genome). In other embodiments, the polynucleotides of the invention do not contain the coding sequence of more than 1000, 500, 250, 100, 50, 25, 20, 15, 10, 5, 4, 3, 2, or 1 genomic flanking gene(s).","As used herein, a \u201cpolynucleotide\u201d refers to a molecule having a nucleic acid sequence contained in SEQ ID NO:1, SEQ ID NO:3, SEQ ID NO:5, SEQ ID NO:7, SEQ ID NO:9, SEQ ID NO:11, or the cDNA contained within the clone deposited with the ATCC. For example, the polynucleotide can contain the nucleotide sequence of the full length cDNA sequence, including the 5\u2032 and 3\u2032 untranslated sequences, the coding region, with or without a signal sequence, the secreted protein coding region, as well as fragments, epitopes, domains, and variants of the nucleic acid sequence. Moreover, as used herein, a \u201cpolypeptide\u201d refers to a molecule having the translated amino acid sequence generated from the polynucleotide as broadly defined.","In the present invention, the full length sequence identified as SEQ ID NO:1, SEQ ID NO:3, SEQ ID NO:5, SEQ ID NO:7, SEQ ID NO:9, and SEQ ID NO:11 was often generated by overlapping sequences contained in multiple clones (contig analysis).

The ATCC\u00ae deposit was made pursuant to the terms of the Budapest Treaty on the international recognition of the deposit of microorganisms for purposes of patent procedure.","Unless otherwise indicated, all nucleotide sequences determined by sequencing a DNA molecule herein were determined using an automated DNA sequencer (such as the Model 373, preferably a Model 3700, from Applied Biosystems, Inc.), and all amino acid sequences of polypeptides encoded by DNA molecules determined herein were predicted by translation of a DNA sequence determined above. Therefore, as is known in the art for any DNA sequence determined by this automated approach, any nucleotide sequence determined herein may contain some errors. Nucleotide sequences determined by automation are typically at least about 90% identical, more typically at least about 95% to at least about 99.9% identical to the actual nucleotide sequence of the sequenced DNA molecule. The actual sequence can be more precisely determined by other approaches including manual DNA sequencing methods well known in the art. As is also known in the art, a single insertion or deletion in a determined nucleotide sequence compared to the actual sequence will cause a frame shift in translation of the nucleotide sequence such that the predicted amino acid sequence encoded by a determined nucleotide sequence will be completely different from the amino acid sequence actually encoded bt the sequenced DNA molecule, beginning at the point of such an insertion or deletion.","Using the information provided herein, such as the nucleotide sequence in  (SEQ ID NO:1), a nucleic acid molecule of the present invention encoding the LTRPC3g polypeptide may be obtained using standard cloning and screening procedures, such as those for cloning cDNAs using mRNA as starting material.

Changes in the stringency of hybridization and signal detection are primarily accomplished through the manipulation of formamide concentration (lower percentages of formamide result in lowered stringency); salt conditions, or temperature. For example, lower stringency conditions include an overnight incubation at 37 degree C. in a solution comprising 6\u00d7SSPE (20\u00d7SSPE=3M NaCl; 0.2M NaH2PO4; 0.02M EDTA, pH 7.4), 0.5% SDS, 30% formamide, 100 ug\/ml salmon sperm blocking DNA; followed by washes at 50 degree C. with 1\u00d7SSPE, 0.1% SDS. In addition, to achieve even lower stringency, washes performed following stringent hybridization can be done at higher salt concentrations (e.g. 5\u00d7SSC).","Note that variations in the above conditions may be accomplished through the inclusion and\/or substitution of alternate blocking reagents used to suppress background in hybridization experiments. Typical blocking reagents include Denhardt's reagent, BLOTTO, heparin, denatured salmon sperm DNA, and commercially available proprietary formulations. The inclusion of specific blocking reagents may require modification of the hybridization conditions described above, due to problems with compatibility.","Of course, a polynucleotide which hybridizes only to polyA+ sequences (such as any 3\u2032 terminal polyA+ tract of a cDNA shown in the sequence listing), or to a complementary stretch of T (or U) residues, would not be included in the definition of \u201cpolynucleotide,\u201d since such a polynucleotide would hybridize to any nucleic acid molecule containing a poly (A) stretch or the complement thereof (e.g., practically any double-stranded cDNA clone generated using oligo dT as a primer).","The polynucleotide of the present invention can be composed of any polyribonucleotide or polydeoxyribonucleotide, which may be unmodified RNA or DNA or modified RNA or DNA. For example, polynucleotides can be composed of single- and double-stranded DNA, DNA that is a mixture of single- and double-stranded regions, single- and double-stranded RNA, and RNA that is mixture of single- and double-stranded regions, hybrid molecules comprising DNA and RNA that may be single-stranded or, more typically, double-stranded or a mixture of single- and double-stranded regions. In addition, the polynucleotide can be composed of triple-stranded regions comprising RNA or DNA or both RNA and DNA. A polynucleotide may also contain one or more modified bases or DNA or RNA backbones modified for stability or for other reasons. \u201cModified\u201d bases include, for example, tritylated bases and unusual bases such as inosine. A variety of modifications can be made to DNA and RNA; thus, \u201cpolynucleotide\u201d embraces chemically, enzymatically, or metabolically modified forms.","The polypeptide of the present invention can be composed of amino acids joined to each other by peptide bonds or modified peptide bonds, i.e., peptide isosteres, and may contain amino acids other than the 20 gene-encoded amino acids. The polypeptides may be modified by either natural processes, such as posttranslational processing, or by chemical modification techniques which are well known in the art. Such modifications are well described in basic texts and in more detailed monographs, as well as in a voluminous research literature. Modifications can occur anywhere in a polypeptide, including the peptide backbone, the amino acid side-chains and the amino or carboxyl termini. It will be appreciated that the same type of modification may be present in the same or varying degrees at several sites in a given polypeptide. Also, a given polypeptide may contain many types of modifications. Polypeptides may be branched, for example, as a result of ubiquitination, and they may be cyclic, with or without branching.

Specifically, the complete open reading frame of LTRPC3 with a C-terminal HA tag was transiently transfected into HEK 293 cells to assess its cellular localization. The HA-tagged LTRPC3 was detected using a fluorescein-conjugated anti-HA antibody and a laser scanning confocal microscope which produces a green fluorescent signal. The green fluorescent signal was exclusively detected at the subplasma membrane region of the transfected cells (see ), which is consistent with LTRPC3 being an integral membrane protein. Under these conditions approximately \u02dc70% of cells are expressing LTRPC3. The expression of full-length protein was accessed with immunoblot using an anti-HA antibody and detected as the expected size of \u02dc170 kD (data not shown).","Since the LTRPC3g polypeptide represents an N-terminally extended variant of the LTRPC3 polypeptide (see polypeptide alignment provided in ), LTRPC3g is expected to have the same or similar function as the LTRPC3 polypeptide. Moreover, the LTRPC3g polypeptide is expected to localize to the cell membrane.","Additional characterization for the LTRPC3 variant protein is provided in U.S. Ser. No. 10\/405,793, filed Mar. 28, 2003; which is hereby incorporated by reference herein in its entirety).","Additionally, anti-HA staining was found to be associated with the membrane marker CM-DiI, indicating LTRPC3 protein in or near the plasmalemmal compartment of transfected cells (see ). Plasmalemmal localization is consistent with the function of the TRP family as Ca-permeable cation channels. LTRPC3 was also observed in intracellular compartments, possibly resulting from overexpression in this heterologous expression system, as observed with other ion channels (Marshall, J., et al., (1995) 14, 211-215.).","The LTRPC3g polypeptide is expected to also localize in or near the plasmalemmal compartment.","Moreover, physiometric studies have shown that LTRPC3 is a functional Ca permeable channel (see , and Example 7). LTRPC3g function was assessed using a Fluorometric Imaging Plate Reader (FLIPR\u2122) that measures real-time intracellular fluorescence changes. Cells transiently transfected with vector or LTRPC3-HA were loaded with the cytoplasmic Ca indicator Fluoro-4 in a 1 mM Ca solution. Addition of Ca to the media resulted in a concentration-dependent influx of Ca into LTRPC3-expressing cells (; right panels), indicating that LTRPC3 is a functional Ca channel. In contrast, vector-transfected cells showed minimal Ca influx under the same experimental conditions (, left panels). The non-transfected cells were indistinguishable from the vector-transfected cells (data not shown). Therefore, LTRPC3 is a constitutively active channel capable of mediating Ca influx.","The LTRPC3g polypeptide is also expected to be a constitutively active channel capable of mediating Ca influx.","To further address the mechanism of LTRPC3-mediated Ca entry, similar Ca addition experiments were performed on transfected cells incubated (\u02dc30 min) in a nominally Ca-free solution. Previous studies have shown that lowering extracellular Ca concentration below physiological levels can deplete intracellular Ca stores in many cell types including HEK 293 (EMBO J. 17, 4274-4282, (1998)). Incubating vector-transfected HEK 293 cells in a nominally Ca-free solution gave rise to Ca entry that was dependent on the concentration of Ca added to the buffers, indicating Ca influx was mediated through endogenous SOCs in HEK293 cells (, left panels). In LTRPC3 cells, the Ca transients triggered by similar Ca treatment were much larger (, right panels). This Ca entry observed in LTRPC3 cells incubated in Ca-free media were greater than those observed in 1 mM Ca media, indicating that LTRPC3-mediated Ca entry can be potentiated by the store-depletion.","The LTRPC3g polypeptide is also expected to mediate Ca entry and that LTRPC3g-mediated Ca entry is expected to be potentiated by store-depletion.","The store-operated mechanism of LTRPC3-mediated Ca influx was tested further by passively depleting Ca stores with thapsigargin (TG), an inhibitor of microsomal Ca ATPases that pumps ions from the cytosol back into the stores. Addition of 2 \u03bcM thapsigargin equivalently depleted Ca stores in LTRPC3-HA- and vector-transfected cells (). Following store depletion with TG, addition of Ca to the buffer induced a much larger Ca entry in LTRPC3 cells compared to the vector control cells.","Receptor-mediated Ca entry was also more pronounced in LTRPC3-HA-transfected cells. Carbachol (CCh) can activate an endogenous muscarinic receptor and trigger IPproduction, leading to store-depletion in HEK 293 cells. The addition of 50 \u03bcM of CCh caused a transient and rapid intracellular Ca increase in both LTRPC3- and vector-transfected cells (). After the store depletion with CCh, adding of Ca to the buffer induced a much larger influx of Ca into LTRPC3 cells, as compared to vector control cells. These results show that after store depletion with TG or CCh LTRPC3-transfected cells exhibit an increased Ca influx when compared to control cells.","The lanthanides, gadolinium (Gd) and lanthanum (La), are noneselective Ca-permeable channel blockers, often used as part of the characterization of overexpressed TRP channels. Both lanthanides blocked LTRPC3 Ca conductance, although La was more potent (). In the presence of 1 mM Ca in which endogenous SOCs is minimally activated (), pre-treatment with 100 \u03bcM of La and Gd blocked LTRPC3 Ca currents, stimulated by adding 10 mM Ca, by 67 and 39%, respectively. These results indicated that LTRPC3 mediated currents are not non-specific leak currents resulting from protein overexpression.","Additional experiments were performed to further confirm the Ca store-depleted activation of LTRPC3 using Gd. The effects of 100 \u03bcM Gd on Ca permeability were tested in vector- and LTRPC3-transfected cells. The minimal Ca influx observed upon addition of 10 mM Ca to the cells (cells were incubated in the presence of 1 mM Ca) in vector-transfected cells (see ) was strongly inhibited by 100 \u03bcM Gd. In contrast, 100 \u03bcM Gd inhibited Ca entry, induced by adding 10 mM Ca, by 53% in LTRPC3-transfected cells (see ). Gd reduced fluorescence units in vector-transfected cells from 1470\u00b1140 to \u221258\u00b18 and in LTRPC3-transfected cells from 6000\u00b1322 to 2080\u00b1199 (n=12). Fluorescence values were measured 150 seconds after adding 10 mM Ca and percent blockade was calculated as 1 minus F\u2212Fin the presence of Gd divided by F\u2212Fwithout blocker. The effects of Gd on LTRPC3-mediated Ca entry, induced by 10 mM Ca, in the presence of thapsigargin or carbachol was also examined. Cells were incubated in nominally Ca-free medium for thapsigargin and carbachol experiments. Gd inhibited Ca entry by 51% after depletion of intracellular stores with thapsigargin (see ). Gd reduced peak fluorescence after 10 mM Ca addition in vector-transfected cells from 26444\u00b12410 to 1316\u00b160 and in LTRPC3-transfected cells from 37676\u00b12425 to 6783\u00b1250 (see  and D, respectively; n=12). Gd inhibited Ca entry by 72% after depletion of intracellular stores with carbachol. Gd reduced peak Ca fluorescence in vector-transfected cells from 9327\u00b1466 to 453\u00b115 and in LTRPC3-transfected cells from 14747\u00b1988 to 1975\u00b179 (see  and F, respectively; n=12). These results show that, under identical conditions, the endogenous Ca entry pathway was strongly blocked by application of 100 \u03bcM Gd whereas the LTRPC3-mediated pathway was partially blocked (53%, see  and B). Stimulation of Ca entry in LTRPC3-transfected cells in the presence of thapsigargin or carbachol was also partially blocked by 100 \u03bcM Gd. These results are consistent with the hypothesis that LTRPC3 mediates a Ca entry pathway that apparently is distinct from the endogenous Ca entry pathways present in HEK 293 cells.","The LTRPC3g polypeptide is also expected to mediate a Ca entry pathway that is distinct from the endogenous Ca entry pathways present in HEK 293 cells.","LTRPC3 is constitutively active but can be potentiated by store-depletion and is partially sensitive to La and Gd blockade. LTRPC3 is believed to represent the first member of the TRPM subfamily that exhibits this store-operated mechanism, although some members of TRPC subfamily have been considered for this role. TRPM1 and TRPM4a are constitutive Ca permeable channels but it is unclear whether they can be stimulated by store-depletion (98, 10692-10697, (2001)). Distinct from TRPM4a, TRPM4b is directly activated by changes in intracellular Ca without significant permeation of Ca (109, 397-401, (2002)). TRPM2 is activated by ADP-ribose, NAD and changes in redox status (411, 595-599, (2001); 293, 1327-1330, (2001); and 9, 163-173, (2002)). TRPM7 is regulated by Mg-ATP and\/or PIP(291, 1043-1047, (2001); 411, 690-695, (2001); and 4, 329-36 (2002)). TRPM8 is activated by cold temperatures and cooling agents (416, 52-58, (2002); and 108, 705-715, (2002)). Therefore, in conjunction with its fairly restricted tissue expression, which is not observed with any other family members, LTRPC3 may have a unique biological function in humans.","Expression profiling designed to measure the steady state mRNA levels encoding the LTRPC3 polypeptide showed predominately high expression levels in kidney. The LTRPC3 polypeptide was also significantly expressed in spinal cord, testis, and brain (as shown in ).","Moreover, Northern hybridizations of the LTRPC3 mRNA confirmed the predominately high expression levels in kidney, and significant expression levels in testis, and brain (as shown in ). The Northern hybridization was not performed on spinal cord tissue.","Expanded analysis of LTRPC3 expression levels by TaqMan\u2122 quantitative PCR (see ) confirmed that the LTRPC3 polypeptide is expressed in kidney, brain, testis (), although higher expression levels were observed in brain than previously appreciated. LTRPC3 mRNA was expressed predominately in the brain, specifically the cerebellum, choroid plexus, the locus coeruleus, the posterior hypothalamus and the substantia nigra. Expression of LTRPC3 was also significantly expressed in the kidney, with higher levels observed in the cortex than in the medulla or pelvis. LTRPC3 was also significantly expressed in the spinal cord, testis, and to a lesser extent in other tissues as shown.","The LTRPC3g polypeptide of the present invention is expected to share the same or similar expression profile as that of the LTRPC3 polypeptide (SEQ ID NO:15).","Therefore, LTRPC3g polynucleotides and polypeptides, including modulators or fragments thereof, may be useful in treating, diagnosing, prognosing, and\/or preventing a variety of neurological conditions, in particular various choroid plexus neoplasms, choroid plexus papilloma, Alzheimer's disease, prion disorders and multiple sclerosis and movement disorders that involve the cerebellum. Based upon the expression pattern of the LTRPC3 variant in kidney, the novel TRP family member LTRPC3g variant may also be the cause of solitary metastasis in the choroid plexus, a rare type of carcinoma. For example, it has been shown that out of 15 cases of solitary metastasis of the choroid plexus, five originated from renal cell carcinoma (Neurol. Med. Chir. (Tokyo) 1997 December; 37(12):916-9). Additionally, given the rather selective expression of the LTRPC3 variant in the choroid plexus and renal tissues, it may be possible that altered function of LTRPC3g may be responsible for solitary metastasis and renal carcinoma. LTRPC3g polynucleotides and polypeptides, including modulators or fragments thereof, may be useful in treating, diagnosing, prognosing, and\/or preventing a variety of renal disorders, particularly solitary metastasis in the choroid plexus, and renal carcinoma.","Morever, an additional analysis of LTRPC3 expression levels by TaqMan\u2122 quantitative PCR (see ) in disease cells and tissues indicated that the LTRPC3 polypeptide is differentially expressed in renal, testicular, and ovarian tumor tissues. In the renal tumor tissue results, an average of 2 out of 3 matched samples, which represent 3 out of 4 samples total, showed a significant decrease in LTRPC3 steady state RNA levels in tumor compared to control samples. In the testicular tumor tissue results, differential expression of LTRPC3 in testicular cancers was observed with all 5 tumor samples showing a significant reduction in steady-state RNA levels compared to two control samples. In the ovarian tumor tissue results, differential expression of LTRPC3 in ovarian cancers was observed with 3 tumor samples showing a significant reduction in steady-state RNA levels compared to five control samples.","The LTRPC3g polypeptide is expected to share the same or similar differential expression patterns observed for the LTRPC3 variant.","Thus, loss of LTRPC3g expression during tumor progression might contribute to the metastatic process by altering internal calcium stores in a manner that reflects a loss of cellular control on apoptosis. Restoring LTRPC3g function might provide a novel therapeutic approach to treating certain cancers. Therefore, LTRPC3g polynucleotides and polypeptides, including modulators or fragments thereof, particularly agonists of LTRPC3g activity or expression, may be useful in treating, diagnosing, prognosing, ameloriating, and\/or preventing a variety of cancers and proliferative conditions, particularly of the kidney, testis, and ovaries.","An additional analysis of LTRPC3 localized expression was assessed using In situ hybridization techniques (ISH). LTRPC3 expression was localized to the cytoplasm of collecting tubular epithelium in the medulla, medullary rays, and periglomerular regions (see , Plates i, ii, iv and v). Tubules in the medulla exhibited the most intense expression. Other tubular epithelia, e.g., proximal convoluted tubular epithelium, exhibited minimal expression. Expression patterns were compared to LTRPC3 sense mRNA-labeled human kidney sections as negative controls (, Plates iii and vi) and to human lysozyme antisense mRNA labeled human kidney sections as positive controls (data not shown).","The observed for the LTRPC3 variant mRNA expression in human kidney, suggests that LTRPC3g may play a role in renal handling of calcium and other cations. The kidney plays a major role in Ca homeostasis. LTRPC3g could be involved in Ca absorption directly due to its Ca permeability. Indeed, the in situ hybridization analysis described herein demonstrates that LTRPC3 is predominantly expressed in the connecting tubule, which has frequently been implicated in active transcellular Ca reabsorption (see Hoenderop, J. G., et al., (2002) 64, 529-549; which is hereby incorporated by reference herein in its entirety). Alternatively, LTRPC3g may function as an SOC that regulates Ca absorption. In the kidney, Ca absorption is regulated by agonists such as calcitonin, parathyroid hormone, and parathyroid hormone-related peptide through their respective G protein-coupled receptors, and downstream SOCs (Friedman, P. A., et al., (1995) 75, 429-471; which is hereby incorporated by reference herein in its entirety).","Potentially, LTRPC3g may be involved in the pathogenesis of calcium homeostasis-related disorders such as hypercaliuric nephrolithiasis, certain forms of osteoporosis, Gitelman's disease and Bartter's syndrom.","In preferred embodiments, LTRPC3g polynucleotides and polypeptides, including fragments and modulators thereof, are useful for treating, diagnosing, and\/or ameliorating Ca reabsorption disorders, disorders associated with aberrant luminal Ca2+ entry via the epithelial Ca2+ channel (ECaC), disorders associated with aberrant cytosolic diffusion of Ca2+ bound to calbindin-D28K, disorders associated with aberrant basolateral extrusion of Ca2+ through the Na+\/Ca2+ exchanger (NCX), disorders associated with aberrant plasma membrane Ca2+-ATPase (PMCA) activity and\/or activation, disorders associated with the hypocalciuric effect of diuretics, disorders associated with the hypocalciuric effect of thiazide diuretics, disorders associated with hormone insufficiencies that affect the function of the kidney, disorders associated with hormone insufficiencies that affect renal Ca2+ homeostasis, disorders associated with aberrant renal Ca2+ homeostasis as a result of vitamin D deficiency, disorders associated with aberrant renal Ca2+ homeostasis as a result of PTH deficiency, disorders associated with aberrant renal Ca2+ homeostasis as a result of vasopressin deficiency, disorders associated with aberrant renal Ca2+ homeostasis as a result of prostaglandines deficiency, disorders associated with aberrant renal Ca2+ homeostasis as a result of estrogen deficiency, disorders associated with aberrant renal Ca2+ homeostasis as a result of calcitonin deficiency, disorders associated with aberrant renal Ca2+ homeostasis as a result of parathyroid hormone deficiency, disorders associated with aberrant renal Ca2+ homeostasis as a result of atrial natriuretic peptide deficiency, calcium homeostasis-related disorders, hypercaliuric nephrolithiasis, certain forms of osteoporosis, Gitelman's disease, Bartter's syndrom, disorders associated with aberrant function of kidney tubular epithelium, disorders associated with aberrant function of kidney tubular epithelium in the medulla, disorders associated with aberrant function of kidney tubular epithelium in the medullary rays, disorders associated with aberrant function of kidney tubular epithelium in the periglomerular.","In preferred embodiments, LTRPC3g polynucleotides and polypeptides, including fragments and modulators thereof, are useful for treating, diagnosing, and\/or ameliorating acute kidney failure, chronic kidney failure, cystic kidney disease, horseshoe kidney, hypertensive kidney disease, kidney atrophy, kidney cancer, kidney disease, kidney failure, kidney infection, kidney metastasis, kidney stone, nephrolithiasis, multicystic dysplastic kidney disease, and polycystic kidney disease.","Characterization of the LTRPC3 variant polypeptide using antisense oligonucleotides led to the determination that LTRPC3 is involved in the negative modulation of the FEN1 DNA base-excision repair\/proliferation modulating protein as described in Example 5 herein.","The LTRCP3g polypeptide is expected to be able to modulate the FEN1 DNA base-excision repair\/proliferation modulating protein to the same or similar extent as the LTRPC3 polypeptide.","Specifically, antisense inhibition of LTRPC3 resulted in upregulation of Fen1, a marker of proliferation. As such, LTRPC3 behaves in a manner similar to a tumor suppressor, in that loss results in increases in proliferation. While some increases in the proliferation markers p21 and IkB were also observed, they were less significant, and could be a response to the pro-proliferative effect of LTRPC3 antisense inhibition. Interestingly, expression of LTRPC3 was also observed to be significantly reduced in tumor tissues, relative to normal tissues (see ). Specifically, renal, testicular, and ovarian tumor samples showed as much as 12 to 30 fold down regulation of LTRPC3 message levels compared to normal tissues. This reduction of LTRPC3 correlating with the tumor state is consistent with the negative FEN1 modulatory activity and suggests this gene may have antiproliferative activities. Therefore, for modulators of LTRPC3g to be useful for treating cancer, it would be necessary to increase the activity of the gene or gene product in order to have the reverse effect on cancerous cells. Thus, an agonist of LTRPC3g activity or a compound that increased LTRPC3g message levels would be a desired invention for cancer therapy.","In preferred embodiments, LTRPC3g polynucleotides and polypeptides, including fragments and modulators thereof, are useful for treating, diagnosing, and\/or ameliorating DNA-repair deficiencies, particularly base-excision repair deficiencies, Xeroderma pigmentosum, skin cancer, melanoma, UV senstivity, alkylation sensivity, gamma irradiation sensitivity, pyrimidine dimer sensitivity, chemical mutagenes, lymphomas, leukemias, photosensitivity, Bloom's syndrone, Fanconi's anemia, ataxia telangiectasia, chromosomal aberrations, blood vessel dilation aberrations in the skin, blood vessel dilation aberrations in the eye, conditions involving increased levels of apurinic sites, conditions involving increased levels of apyrimidinic sites, conditions involving increased levels of abasic sites, disorders related to aberrant signal transduction, proliferating disorders, and\/or cancers.","Moreover, LTRPC3g polynucleotides and polypeptides, including fragments and modulators thereof, are useful for increasing mammalian base excision repair activity, increasing mammalian single-nucleotide base excision repair activity, and\/or increasing mammalian long patch base excision repair activity.","In preferred embodiments, antagonists directed against LTRPC3g are useful for treating, diagnosing, and\/or ameliorating DNA-repair deficiencies, particularly base-excision repair deficiencies, Xeroderma pigmentosum, skin cancer, melanoma, UV senstivity, alkylation sensivity, gamma irradiation sensitivity, pyrimidine dimer sensitivity, chemical mutagenes, lymphomas, leukemias, photosensitivity, Bloom's syndrone, Fanconi's anemia, ataxia telangiectasia, chromosomal aberrations, blood vessel dilation aberrations in the skin, blood vessel dilation aberrations in the eye, conditions involving increased levels of apurinic sites, conditions involving increased levels of apyrimidinic sites, conditions involving increased levels of abasic sites, disorders related to aberrant signal transduction, proliferating disorders, and\/or cancers.","Moreover, antagonists directed against LTRPC3g are useful for increasing mammalian base excision repair activity, increasing mammalian single-nucleotide base excision repair activity, and\/or increasing mammalian long patch base excision repair activity.","In preferred embodiments, agonists directed against LTRPC3g are useful for treating, diagnosing, and\/or ameliorating, disorders related to aberrant signal transduction, proliferating disorders, and\/or cancers, particularly renal cell carcinomas, testicular cancers, and\/or ovarian cancers.","Moreover, agonists directed against LTRPC3g are useful for decreasing mammalian base excision repair activity, decreasing mammalian single-nucleotide base excision repair activity, and\/or decreasing mammalian long patch base excision repair activity.","The strong homology to human transient receptor potential channels (TRP), combined with the predominate localized expression in kidney tissue of the LTRPC3 variant, suggests the LTRPC3g polynucleotides and polypeptides, including modulators or fragments thereof, may be useful in treating, diagnosing, prognosing, and\/or preventing renal diseases and\/or disorders, which include, but are not limited to: nephritis, renal failure, nephrotic syndrome, urinary tract infection, hematuria, proteinuria, oliguria, polyuria, nocturia, edema, hypertension, electrolyte disorders, sterile pyuria, renal osteodystrophy, large kidneys, renal transport defects, nephrolithiasis, azotemia, anuria, urinary retention, slowing of urinary stream, large prostate, flank tenderness, full bladder sensation after voiding, enuresis, dysuria, bacteriuria, kideny stones, glomerulonephritis, vasculitis, hemolytic uremic syndromes, thrombotic thrombocytopenic purpura, malignant hypertension, casts, tubulointerstitial kidney diseases, renal tubular acidosis, pyelonephritis, hydronephritis, nephrotic syndrome, crush syndrome, and\/or renal colic, in addition to Wilm's Tumor Disease, and congenital kidney abnormalities such as horseshoe kidney, polycystic kidney, and Falconi's syndrome. for example.","Several known TRP family members have been identified that are expressed significantly in kidney tissue. These TRP family members include, for example, Trp12 (Wissenbach, U., Bodding, M., Freichel, M., Flockerzi, V, Lett., 485(2-3):127-34, (2000)); OTRPC4 (Strotmann, R., Harteneck, C., Nunnenmacher, K., Schultz, G., Plant, T, D, Nat, Cell, Biol., 2(10):695-702, (2000)); polycystin-L2 (Guo, L., Schreiber, T, H., Weremowicz, S., Morton, C, C., Lee, C., Zhou, J.

Representative uses are described in the \u201cRegeneration\u201d and \u201cHyperproliferative Disorders\u201d sections below, in the Examples, and elsewhere herein. Briefly, the uses include, but are not limited to the detection, treatment, and\/or prevention of Alzheimer's Disease, Parkinson's Disease, Huntington's Disease, Tourette Syndrome, meningitis, encephalitis, demyelinating diseases, peripheral neuropathies, neoplasia, trauma, congenital malformations, spinal cord injuries, ischemia and infarction, aneurysms, hemorrhages, schizophrenia, mania, dementia, paranoia, obsessive compulsive disorder, depression, panic disorder, learning disabilities, ALS, psychoses, autism, and altered behaviors, including disorders in feeding, sleep patterns, balance, and perception. In addition, elevated expression of this gene product in regions of the brain indicates it plays a role in normal neural function. Potentially, this gene product is involved in synapse formation, neurotransmission, learning, cognition, homeostasis, or neuronal differentiation or survival. Furthermore, the protein may also be used to determine biological activity, to raise antibodies, as tissue markers, to isolate cognate ligands or receptors, to identify agents that modulate their interactions, in addition to its use as a nutritional supplement. Protein, as well as, antibodies directed against the protein may show utility as a tumor marker and\/or immunotherapy targets for the above listed tissues.","The strong homology to human transient receptor potential channels (TRP), combined with the localized expression in testis tissue of the LTRPC3 variant emphasizes the potential utility for LTRPC3g polynucleotides and polypeptides in treating, diagnosing, prognosing, and\/or preventing testicular, in addition to reproductive disorders.","In preferred embodiments, LTRPC3g polynucleotides and polypeptides including agonists and fragments thereof, have uses which include treating, diagnosing, prognosing, and\/or preventing the following, non-limiting, diseases or disorders of the testis: spermatogenesis, infertility, Klinefelter's syndrome, XX male, epididymitis, genital warts, germinal cell aplasia, cryptorchidism, varicocele, immotile cilia syndrome, and viral orchitis.

The testes are also a site of active gene expression of transcripts that is expressed, particularly at low levels, in other tissues of the body. Therefore, this gene product may be expressed in other specific tissues or organs where it may play related functional roles in other processes, such as hematopoiesis, inflammation, bone formation, and kidney function, to name a few possible target indications.","Several known TRP family members have been identified that are expressed significantly in testis tissue. These TRP family members include, for example, polycystin-L2 (Guo, L., Schreiber, T, H., Weremowicz, S., Morton, C, C., Lee, C., Zhou, J. Genomics., 64(3):241-51, (2000)); TRP7 (Okada, T., Inoue, R., Yamazaki, K., Maeda, A., Kurosaki, T., Yamakuni, T., Tanaka, I., Shimizu, S., Ikenaka, K., Imoto, K., Mori, Y, J.

Moreover, transient receptor potential channel family members have been implicated in disorders of the skin, skeletal-muscle, nervous, cardiac, and vascular systems, in addition to the following, non-limiting diseases and disorders, which include, for example, arteriosclerosis, neointimal hypoerplasia, metastatic melanomas, bipolar disorder, nonsyndromic hereditary deafness, Knobloch syndrome, holosencephaly, and various maligancies including prostate cancer.","In preferred embodiments, LTRPC3g polynucleotides and polypeptides of the present invention, including agonists and\/or fragments thereof, have uses that include, modulating cell proliferation, differentiation, migration, activation, exocytosis, muscle contraction, gene expression, apoptosis. signalling, pheromone sensory signaling, smooth muscle tone, pain perception, heat perception, osmosenstivity, and mechanosensitivity.","In more preferred embodiments, LTRPC3g polynucleotides and polypeptides of the present invention, including agonists and\/or fragments thereof, have uses that include, treating, ameliorating, preventing, detecting, and\/or prognosing various diseases and disorders, particularly the following, non-limiting examples, disorders of the skin, skeletal-muscle, nervous, cardiac, and vascular systems, in addition to the following, non-limiting diseases and disorders, which include, for example, arteriosclerosis, neointimal hypoerplasia, metastatic melanomas, bipolar disorder, nonsyndromic hereditary deafness, Knobloch syndrome, holosencephaly, and various maligancies including prostate cancer.","LTRPC3g polynucleotides and polypeptides of the present invention, including agonists and\/or fragments may be involved in intracellular Ca homeostasis which affects various aspects of biological functions including mechano-regulation, pain transduction, vasorelaxation, gene expression, cell cycle and proliferation\/apoptosis. Since the LTRPC3 variant is dominantly expressed in kidney, the LTRPC3g polypeptide may particularly play an important role in regulating cytosolic Ca2+ in the renal system, potentially Ca2+ absorption.","The LTRPC3g gene maps to chromosome 9q21.11-21.31 between the two markers D9S1874 and D9S1807. This region is linked to amyotrophic lateral sclerosis with frontotemporal dementia, early-onset pulverulent cataract, infantile nephronophthisis, hypomagnesemia with secondary hypocalcemia (HSH), and familial hemophagocytic lymphohistiocytosis. Therefore, agonists and\/or antagonists of the novel LTRPC3g can be used to treat diseases including various forms of neuronal degeneration, neurogenic inflammation, allergy, immunodeficiency\/excessive immune activation, visual defects, hearing disorder, pain, cancer, hypertension and other cardiovascular diseases. In addition, the therapeutics may be useful in the treatment of diseases associated with disturbances in Ca homeostasis including osteoporosis, hypercalciuric stone disease, and chronic renal failure.","Moreover, given the selective expression in kidney, LTRPC3g could be considered a candidate gene for HSH, since the phenotype is a renal insufficiency. LTRPC3g chromosomal location is \u02dc600 kb downstream of a X;9 translocation breakpoint interval described for one patient with HSH (6, 1491-1497, (1997)). Recently, two groups reported that a new member of the TRPM subfamily, TRPM6, expressed in both intestinal tissues and kidney, is associated with HSH (31, 166-170, (2002); and 31, 171-174 (2002)). Indeed, LTRPC3g is \u02dc4 mb 5\u2032 to TRPM6 on 9q21. Although TRPM6 is the first component identified for HSH, this should not preclude involvement of LTRPC3g in the disease. Therefore, it is possible that LTRPC3g may co-localize with TRPM6 and\/or forms a heteromultimer with TRPM6 in the kidney.","The kidney plays a major role in Ca homeostasis (reviewed in 75, 429-471, (1995)). LTRPC3g may play a direct role in Ca absorption due to its constitutive Ca permeability. Alternatively, LTRPC3g may be the SOC that regulates Ca absorption. In kidney, Ca absorption is regulated by agonists such as calcitonin, parathyroid hormone and parathyroid hormone-related peptide through their respective G protein-coupled receptors, and downstream SOCs. Additionally, in kidney a SOC has been described (276, 25759-25765, (2001)) for the action of angiotensin II, a vasoactive peptide that plays a major role in regulating blood pressure.","In addition, LTRPC3g polynucleotides and polypeptides of the present invention, including agonists and\/or fragments thereof, have uses that include modulating intracellular Ca++ ion concentrations, Ca++ ion flux, stored intracellular Ca++ ion concentrations, Ca++ ion pump activity, Ca++ ion flow into cell, Ca++ ion flow out of cells, the activation of Ca++ sensitive proteins, the activation of Ca++ sensitive signaling pathways, the activation of kinase-activatible proteins, and the activation of kinase-dependent signaling pathways.","The LTRPC3g polynucleotides and polypeptides of the present invention, including agonists and\/or fragments thereof, have uses that include modulating proliferation, differentiation, migration, and activation in various cells, tissues, and organisms, and particularly in mammalian kidney, spinal cord, testis, and brain, preferably human. LTRPC3g polynucleotides and polypeptides of the present invention, including agonists and\/or fragments thereof, may be useful in diagnosing, treating, prognosing, and\/or preventing renal, neural, and\/or proliferative diseases or disorders, particularly of the renal system.","In addition, antagonists of the LTRPC3g polynucleotides and polypeptides, including modulators or fragments thereof, may have uses that include diagnosing, treating, prognosing, and\/or preventing diseases or disorders related to transient receptor potential channel activity, which may include renal, neural, reproductive, and\/or proliferative diseases or disorders.","Although it is believed the encoded polypeptide may share at least some biological activities with transient receptor potential channel family members, particularly those melastatin1, a number of methods of determining the exact biological function of this clone are either known in the art or are described elsewhere herein. Briefly, the function of this clone may be determined by applying microarray methodology. Nucleic acids corresponding to the LTRPC3g polynucleotides, in addition to, other clones of the present invention, may be arrayed on microchips for expression profiling. Depending on which polynucleotide probe is used to hybridize to the slides, a change in expression of a specific gene may provide additional insight into the function of this gene based upon the conditions being studied. For example, an observed increase or decrease in expression levels when the polynucleotide probe used comes from tissue that has been treated with known transient potential receptor inhibitors, which include, but are not limited to the drugs listed herein or otherwise known in the art, might indicate a function in modulating transient potential receptor function, for example. In the case of LTRPC3g, kidney, spinal cord, testis, and brain, should be used to extract RNA to prepare the probe.","In addition, the function of the protein may be assessed by applying quantitative PCR methodology, for example. Real time quantitative PCR would provide the capability of following the expression of the LTRPC3g gene throughout development, for example. Quantitative PCR methodology requires only a nominal amount of tissue from each developmentally important step is needed to perform such experiments. Therefore, the application of quantitative PCR methodology to refining the biological function of this polypeptide is encompassed by the present invention. Also encompassed by the present invention are quantitative PCR probes corresponding to the polynucleotide sequence provided as SEQ ID NO:1 ().","The function of the protein may also be assessed through complementation assays in yeast. For example, in the case of the LTRPC3g, transforming yeast deficient in transient receptor potential channel activity with LTRPC3g and assessing their ability to grow would provide convincing evidence the LTRPC3g polypeptide has transient receptor potential channel activity. Additional assay conditions and methods that may be used in assessing the function of the polynucletides and polypeptides of the present invention are known in the art, some of which are disclosed elsewhere herein.","Alternatively, the biological function of the encoded polypeptide may be determined by disrupting a homologue of this polypeptide in Mice and\/or rats and observing the resulting phenotype.","Moreover, the biological function of this polypeptide may be determined by the application of antisense and\/or sense methodology and the resulting generation of transgenic mice and\/or rats. Expressing a particular gene in either sense or antisense orientation in a transgenic mouse or rat could lead to respectively higher or lower expression levels of that particular gene. Altering the endogenous expression levels of a gene can lead to the observation of a particular phenotype that can then be used to derive indications on the function of the gene. The gene can be either over-expressed or under expressed in every cell of the organism at all times using a strong ubiquitous promoter, or it could be expressed in one or more discrete parts of the organism using a well characterized tissue-specific promoter (e.g., a kidney, spinal cord, testis, and\/or brain-specific promoter), or it can be expressed at a specified time of development using an inducible and\/or a developmentally regulated promoter.","In the case of LTRPC3g transgenic mice or rats, if no phenotype is apparent in normal growth conditions, observing the organism under diseased conditions (renal, reproductive, neural, or proliferative disorders, etc.) may lead to understanding the function of the gene. Therefore, the application of antisense and\/or sense methodology to the creation of transgenic mice or rats to refine the biological function of the polypeptide is encompassed by the present invention.","In preferred embodiments, the following N-terminal LTRPC3g deletion polypeptides are encompassed by the present invention: M1-T1709, G2-T1709, K3-T1709, K4-T1709, W5-T1709, R6-T1709, D7-T1709, A8-T1709, A9-T1709, E10-T1709, M11-T1709, E12-T1709, R13-T1709, G14-T1709, C15-T1709, S16-T1709, D17-T1709, R18-T1709, E19-T1709, D20-T1709, N21-T1709, A22-T1709, E23-T1709, S24-T1709, R25-T1709, R26-T1709, R27-T1709, S28-T1709, R29-T1709, S30-T1709, A31-T1709, S32-T1709, R33-T1709, G34-T1709, R35-T1709, F36-T1709, A37-T1709, E38-T1709, S39-T1709, W40-T1709, K41-T1709, R42-T1709, L43-T1709, S44-T1709, S45-T1709, K46-T1709, Q47-T1709, G48-T1709, S49-T1709, T50-T1709, K51-T1709, R52-T1709, S53-T1709, G54-T1709, L55-T1709, P56-T1709, S57-T1709, Q58-T1709, Q59-T1709, T60-T1709, P61-T1709, A62-T1709, Q63-T1709, K64-T1709, S65-T1709, W66-T1709, I67-T1709, E68-T1709, R69-T1709, A70-T1709, F71-T1709, Y72-T1709, K73-T1709, R74-T1709, E75-T1709, C76-T1709, V77-T1709, H78-T1709, I79-T1709, I80-T1709, P81-T1709, S82-T1709, T83-T1709, K84-T1709, D85-T1709, P86-T1709, H87-T1709, R88-T1709, C89-T1709, C90-T1709, C91-T1709, G92-T1709, R93-T1709, L94-T1709, I95-T1709, G96-T1709, Q97-T1709, H98-T1709, V99-T1709, G100-T1709, L101-T1709, T102-T1709, P103-T1709, S104-T1709, I105-T1709, S106-T1709, V107-T1709, L108-T1709, Q109-T1709, N110-T1709, E111-T1709, K112-T1709, N113-T1709, E114-T1709, S115-T1709, R116-T1709, L117-T1709, S118-T1709, R119-T1709, N120-T1709, D121-T1709, I122-T1709, Q123-T1709, S124-T1709, E125-T1709, K126-T1709, W127-T1709, S128-T1709, I129-T1709, S130-T1709, K131-T1709, H132-T1709, T133-T1709, Q134-T1709, L135-T1709, S136-T1709, P137-T1709, T138-T1709, D139-T1709, A140-T1709, F141-T1709, G142-T1709, T143-T1709, I144-T1709, E145-T1709, F146-T1709, Q147-T1709, G148-T1709, G149-T1709, G150-T1709, H151-T1709, S152-T1709, N153-T1709, K154-T1709, and\/or A155-T1709 of SEQ ID NO:2.

Polynucleotide sequences encoding these polypeptides are also provided. The present invention also encompasses the use of these C-terminal LTRPC3g deletion polypeptides as immunogenic and\/or antigenic epitopes as described elsewhere herein.","Alternatively, preferred polypeptides of the present invention may comprise polypeptide sequences corresponding to, for example, internal regions of the LTRPC3g polypeptide (e.g., any combination of both N- and C-terminal LTRPC3g polypeptide deletions) of SEQ ID NO:2. For example, internal regions could be defined by the equation: amino acid NX to amino acid CX, wherein NX refers to any N-terminal deletion polypeptide amino acid of LTRPC3g (SEQ ID NO:2), and where CX refers to any C-terminal deletion polypeptide amino acid of LTRPC3g (SEQ ID NO:2). Polynucleotides encoding these polypeptides are also provided. The present invention also encompasses the use of these polypeptides as an immunogenic and\/or antigenic epitope as described elsewhere herein.","Many polynucleotide sequences, such as EST sequences, are publicly available and accessible through sequence databases. Some of these sequences are related to SEQ ID NO: 1 and may have been publicly available prior to conception of the present invention. Preferably, such related polynucleotides are specifically excluded from the scope of the present invention. To list every related sequence would be cumbersome. Accordingly, preferably excluded from the present invention are one or more polynucleotides consisting of a nucleotide sequence described by the general formula of a-b, where a is any integer between 1 to 5187 of SEQ ID NO:1, b is an integer between 15 to 5201, where both a and b correspond to the positions of nucleotide residues shown in SEQ ID NO:1, and where b is greater than or equal to a+14.","The polypeptide of this gene provided as SEQ ID NO:4 (), encoded by the polynucleotide sequence according to SEQ ID NO:3 (), and\/or encoded by the polynucleotide contained within the deposited clone, LTRPC3h, has significant homology at the nucleotide and amino acid level to the human melastatin 1 protein (Melastatin1; Genbank Accession No. gi|3243075; SEQ ID NO:13). An alignment of the LTRPC3h polypeptide with this protein is provided in .","The LTRPC3h polypeptide was determined to share 65.7% identity and 73.5% similarity with the human melastatin 1 protein (Melastatin1; Genbank Accession No. gi|3243075; SEQ ID NO:13) as shown in .","The LTRPC3h protein is believed to represent a member of a new class of protein kinases referred to as alpha kinases (Curr. Biol. 9 (2), R43-R45 (1999)). These kinases represent a novel type of signaling molecule comprising both a catalytic protein kinase domain, in addition to, an ion channel domain. This family is commonly referred to as the transient receptor potential channel (TRP) family. Melastatin1 defines a separate subfamily of TRP channels referred to as TRPM (melastatin1). TRPM family members are characteristic of their unusually long cytoplasmic tails at both ends of the channel domain and some of the family members contain an enzyme domain at the C-terminal region.","Specifically, the LTRPC3h (SEQ ID NO:4) polypeptide represents a novel variant of the LTRPC3b (U.S. Ser. No. 10\/210,152, filed Aug. 1, 2002; International Publication No. WO 03\/012063, published Feb. 13, 2003; SEQ ID NO:17; and also U.S. Ser. No. 10\/405,793, filed Mar. 28, 2003; which are hereby incorporated by reference herein in their entirety) polypeptide. The LTRPC3h represents a novel member of the TRPM subfamily.","The melastatin1 protein is believed to be negatively associated with the incidence of melanoma based upon its inverse correlative expression in highly aggressive melanomas (Genomics 54 (1), 116-123 (1998)). Thus, overexpression of melastatin1 could represent a novel therapeutic in the treatment of melanoma and potentially other cancers.","Based upon the observed homology, the polypeptide of the present invention is expected to share at least some biological activity with other transient receptor potential channel family members, more specifically with the melastatin1 protein, in addition to, other transient receptor potential channel family members referenced elsewhere herein or otherwise known in the art, particularly LTRPC3b, and LTRPC3.","Most of the known transient receptor potential channel family members, possess one or more transmembrane domains. Likewise, the LTRPC3h polypeptide has been determined to comprise six transmembrane domains (TM1-TM6) as shown in . The transmembrane domains are located from about amino acid 787 to about amino acid 804 (TM1), from about amino acid 884 to about amino acid 901 (TM2), from about amino acid 957 to about amino acid 970 (TM3), from about amino acid 984 to about amino acid 1001 (TM4), from about amino acid 1018 to about amino acid 1035 (TM5), and\/or from about amino acid 1106 to about amino acid 1125 (TM6) of SEQ ID NO:4.

As such, LTRPC3 behaves in a manner similar to a tumor suppressor, in that loss results in increases in proliferation. While some increases in the proliferation markers p21 and IkB were also observed, they were less significant, and could be a response to the pro-proliferative effect of LTRPC3 antisense inhibition. Interestingly, expression of LTRPC3 was also observed to be significantly reduced in tumor tissues, relative to normal tissues (see ). Specifically, renal, testicular, and ovarian tumor samples showed as much as 12 to 30 fold down regulation of LTRPC3 message levels compared to normal tissues. This reduction of LTRPC3 correlating with the tumor state is consistent with the negative FEN1 modulatory activity and suggests this gene may have antiproliferative activities. Therefore, for modulators of LTRPC3h to be useful for treating cancer, it would be necessary to increase the activity of the gene or gene product in order to have the reverse effect on cancerous cells.

Representative uses are described in the \u201cRegeneration\u201d and \u201cHyperproliferative Disorders\u201d sections below, in the Examples, and elsewhere herein.

The testes are also a site of active gene expression of transcripts that is expressed, particularly at low levels, in other tissues of the body. Therefore, this gene product may be expressed in other specific tissues or organs where it may play related functional roles in other processes, such as hematopoiesis, inflammation, bone formation, and kidney function, to name a few possible target indications.","Several known TRP family members have been identified that are expressed significantly in testis tissue.

Moreover, transient receptor potential channel family members have been implicated in disorders of the skin, skeletal-muscle, nervous, cardiac, and vascular systems, in addition to the following, non-limiting diseases and disorders, which include, for example, arteriosclerosis, neointimal hypoerplasia, metastatic melanomas, bipolar disorder, nonsyndromic hereditary deafness, Knobloch syndrome, holosencephaly, and various maligancies including prostate cancer.","In preferred embodiments, LTRPC3h polynucleotides and polypeptides of the present invention, including agonists and\/or fragments thereof, have uses that include, modulating cell proliferation, differentiation, migration, activation, exocytosis, muscle contraction, gene expression, apoptosis. signalling, pheromone sensory signaling, smooth muscle tone, pain perception, heat perception, osmosenstivity, and mechanosensitivity.","In more preferred embodiments, LTRPC3h polynucleotides and polypeptides of the present invention, including agonists and\/or fragments thereof, have uses that include, treating, ameliorating, preventing, detecting, and\/or prognosing various diseases and disorders, particularly the following, non-limiting examples, disorders of the skin, skeletal-muscle, nervous, cardiac, and vascular systems, in addition to the following, non-limiting diseases and disorders, which include, for example, arteriosclerosis, neointimal hypoerplasia, metastatic melanomas, bipolar disorder, nonsyndromic hereditary deafness, Knobloch syndrome, holosencephaly, and various maligancies including prostate cancer.","LTRPC3h polynucleotides and polypeptides of the present invention, including agonists and\/or fragments may be involved in intracellular Ca homeostasis which affects various aspects of biological functions including mechano-regulation, pain transduction, vasorelaxation, gene expression, cell cycle and proliferation\/apoptosis. Since the LTRPC3 variant is dominantly expressed in kidney, the LTRPC3h polypeptide may particularly play an important role in regulating cytosolic Ca2+ in the renal system, potentially Ca2+ absorption.","The LTRPC3h gene maps to chromosome 9q21.11-21.31 between the two markers D9S1874 and D9S1807. This region is linked to amyotrophic lateral sclerosis with frontotemporal dementia, early-onset pulverulent cataract, infantile nephronophthisis, hypomagnesemia with secondary hypocalcemia (HSH), and familial hemophagocytic lymphohistiocytosis. Therefore, agonists and\/or antagonists of the novel LTRPC3h can be used to treat diseases including various forms of neuronal degeneration, neurogenic inflammation, allergy, immunodeficiency\/excessive immune activation, visual defects, hearing disorder, pain, cancer, hypertension and other cardiovascular diseases. In addition, the therapeutics may be useful in the treatment of diseases associated with disturbances in Ca homeostasis including osteoporosis, hypercalciuric stone disease, and chronic renal failure.","Moreover, given the selective expression in kidney, LTRPC3h could be considered a candidate gene for HSH, since the phenotype is a renal insufficiency. LTRPC3h chromosomal location is \u02dc600 kb downstream of a X;9 translocation breakpoint interval described for one patient with HSH (6, 1491-1497, (1997)). Recently, two groups reported that a new member of the TRPM subfamily, TRPM6, expressed in both intestinal tissues and kidney, is associated with HSH (31, 166-170, (2002); and 31, 171-174 (2002)). Indeed, LTRPC3h is \u02dc4 mb 5\u2032 to TRPM6 on 9q21. Although TRPM6 is the first component identified for HSH, this should not preclude involvement of LTRPC3h in the disease. Therefore, it is possible that LTRPC3h may co-localize with TRPM6 and\/or forms a heteromultimer with TRPM6 in the kidney.","The kidney plays a major role in Ca homeostasis (reviewed in 75, 429-471, (1995)). LTRPC3h may play a direct role in Ca absorption due to its constitutive Ca permeability. Alternatively, LTRPC3h may be the SOC that regulates Ca absorption. In kidney, Ca absorption is regulated by agonists such as calcitonin, parathyroid hormone and parathyroid hormone-related peptide through their respective G protein-coupled receptors, and downstream SOCs. Additionally, in kidney a SOC has been described (276, 25759-25765, (2001)) for the action of angiotensin II, a vasoactive peptide that plays a major role in regulating blood pressure.","In addition, LTRPC3h polynucleotides and polypeptides of the present invention, including agonists and\/or fragments thereof, have uses that include modulating intracellular Ca++ ion concentrations, Ca++ ion flux, stored intracellular Ca++ ion concentrations, Ca++ ion pump activity, Ca++ ion flow into cell, Ca++ ion flow out of cells, the activation of Ca++ sensitive proteins, the activation of Ca++ sensitive signaling pathways, the activation of kinase-activatible proteins, and the activation of kinase-dependent signaling pathways.","The LTRPC3h polynucleotides and polypeptides of the present invention, including agonists and\/or fragments thereof, have uses that include modulating proliferation, differentiation, migration, and activation in various cells, tissues, and organisms, and particularly in mammalian kidney, spinal cord, testis, and brain, preferably human. LTRPC3h polynucleotides and polypeptides of the present invention, including agonists and\/or fragments thereof, may be useful in diagnosing, treating, prognosing, and\/or preventing renal, neural, and\/or proliferative diseases or disorders, particularly of the renal system.","In addition, antagonists of the LTRPC3h polynucleotides and polypeptides, including modulators or fragments thereof, may have uses that include diagnosing, treating, prognosing, and\/or preventing diseases or disorders related to transient receptor potential channel activity, which may include renal, neural, reproductive, and\/or proliferative diseases or disorders.","Although it is believed the encoded polypeptide may share at least some biological activities with transient receptor potential channel family members, particularly those melastatin1, a number of methods of determining the exact biological function of this clone are either known in the art or are described elsewhere herein. Briefly, the function of this clone may be determined by applying microarray methodology. Nucleic acids corresponding to the LTRPC3h polynucleotides, in addition to, other clones of the present invention, may be arrayed on microchips for expression profiling. Depending on which polynucleotide probe is used to hybridize to the slides, a change in expression of a specific gene may provide additional insight into the function of this gene based upon the conditions being studied. For example, an observed increase or decrease in expression levels when the polynucleotide probe used comes from tissue that has been treated with known transient potential receptor inhibitors, which include, but are not limited to the drugs listed herein or otherwise known in the art, might indicate a function in modulating transient potential receptor function, for example. In the case of LTRPC3h, kidney, spinal cord, testis, and brain, should be used to extract RNA to prepare the probe.","In addition, the function of the protein may be assessed by applying quantitative PCR methodology, for example. Real time quantitative PCR would provide the capability of following the expression of the LTRPC3h gene throughout development, for example. Quantitative PCR methodology requires only a nominal amount of tissue from each developmentally important step is needed to perform such experiments. Therefore, the application of quantitative PCR methodology to refining the biological function of this polypeptide is encompassed by the present invention. Also encompassed by the present invention are quantitative PCR probes corresponding to the polynucleotide sequence provided as SEQ ID NO:1 ().","The function of the protein may also be assessed through complementation assays in yeast. For example, in the case of the LTRPC3h, transforming yeast deficient in transient receptor potential channel activity with LTRPC3h and assessing their ability to grow would provide convincing evidence the LTRPC3h polypeptide has transient receptor potential channel activity. Additional assay conditions and methods that may be used in assessing the function of the polynucletides and polypeptides of the present invention are known in the art, some of which are disclosed elsewhere herein.","Alternatively, the biological function of the encoded polypeptide may be determined by disrupting a homologue of this polypeptide in Mice and\/or rats and observing the resulting phenotype.","Moreover, the biological function of this polypeptide may be determined by the application of antisense and\/or sense methodology and the resulting generation of transgenic mice and\/or rats. Expressing a particular gene in either sense or antisense orientation in a transgenic mouse or rat could lead to respectively higher or lower expression levels of that particular gene. Altering the endogenous expression levels of a gene can lead to the observation of a particular phenotype that can then be used to derive indications on the function of the gene. The gene can be either over-expressed or under expressed in every cell of the organism at all times using a strong ubiquitous promoter, or it could be expressed in one or more discrete parts of the organism using a well characterized tissue-specific promoter (e.g., a kidney, spinal cord, testis, and\/or brain-specific promoter), or it can be expressed at a specified time of development using an inducible and\/or a developmentally regulated promoter.","In the case of LTRPC3h transgenic mice or rats, if no phenotype is apparent in normal growth conditions, observing the organism under diseased conditions (renal, reproductive, neural, or proliferative disorders, etc.) may lead to understanding the function of the gene. Therefore, the application of antisense and\/or sense methodology to the creation of transgenic mice or rats to refine the biological function of the polypeptide is encompassed by the present invention.","In preferred embodiments, the following N-terminal LTRPC3h deletion polypeptides are encompassed by the present invention: M1-T1721, G2-T1721, K3-T1721, K4-T1721, W5-T1721, R6-T1721, D7-T1721, A8-T1721, A9-T1721, E10-T1721, M1\u2032-T1721, E12-T1721, R13-T1721, G14-T1721, C15-T1721, S16-T1721, D17-T1721, R18-T1721, E19-T1721, D20-T1721, N21-T1721, A22-T1721, E23-T1721, S24-T1721, R25-T1721, R26-T1721, R27-T1721, S28-T1721, R29-T1721, S30-T1721, A31-T1721, S32-T1721, R33-T1721, G34-T1721, R35-T1721, F36-T1721, A37-T1721, E38-T1721, S39-T1721, W40-T1721, K41-T1721, R42-T1721, L43-T1721, S44-T1721, S45-T1721, K46-T1721, Q47-T1721, G48-T1721, S49-T1721, T50-T1721, K51-T1721, R52-T1721, S53-T1721, G54-T1721, L55-T1721, P56-T1721, S57-T1721, Q58-T1721, Q59-T1721, T60-T1721, P61-T1721, A62-T1721, Q63-T1721, K64-T1721, S65-T1721, W66-T1721, I67-T1721, E68-T1721, R69-T1721, A70-T1721, F71-T1721, Y72-T1721, K73-T1721, R74-T1721, E75-T1721, C76-T1721, V77-T1721, H78-T1721, I79-T1721, I80-T1721, P81-T1721, S82-T1721, T83-T1721, K84-T1721, D85-T1721, P86-T1721, H87-T1721, R88-T1721, C89-T1721, C90-T1721, C91-T1721, G92-T1721, R93-T1721, L94-T1721, I95-T1721, G96-T1721, Q97-T1721, H98-T1721, V99-T1721, G100-T1721, L10-T1721, T102-T1721, P103-T1721, S104-T1721, I105-T1721, S106-T1721, V107-T1721, L108-T1721, Q109-T1721, N110-T1721, E111-T1721, K112-T1721, N113-T1721, E114-T1721, S115-T1721, R116-T1721, L117-T1721, S118-T1721, R119-T1721, N120-T1721, D121-T1721, I122-T1721, Q123-T1721, S124-T1721, E125-T1721, K126-T1721, W127-T1721, S128-T1721, I129-T1721, S130-T1721, K131-T1721, H132-T1721, T133-T1721, Q134-T1721, L135-T1721, S136-T1721, P137-T1721, T138-T1721, D139-T1721, A140-T1721, F141-T1721, G142-T1721, T143-T1721, I144-T1721, E145-T1721, F146-T1721, Q147-T1721, G148-T1721, G149-T1721, G150-T1721, H151-T1721, S152-T1721, N153-T1721, K154-T1721, and\/or A155-T1721 of SEQ ID NO:4.

As such, LTRPC3 behaves in a manner similar to a tumor suppressor, in that loss results in increases in proliferation. While some increases in the proliferation markers p21 and IkB were also observed, they were less significant, and could be a response to the pro-proliferative effect of LTRPC3 antisense inhibition.

Specifically, renal, testicular, and ovarian tumor samples showed as much as 12 to 30 fold down regulation of LTRPC3 message levels compared to normal tissues. This reduction of LTRPC3 correlating with the tumor state is consistent with the negative FEN1 modulatory activity and suggests this gene may have antiproliferative activities.

Moreover, transient receptor potential channel family members have been implicated in disorders of the skin, skeletal-muscle, nervous, cardiac, and vascular systems, in addition to the following, non-limiting diseases and disorders, which include, for example, arteriosclerosis, neointimal hypoerplasia, metastatic melanomas, bipolar disorder, nonsyndromic hereditary deafness, Knobloch syndrome, holosencephaly, and various maligancies including prostate cancer.","In preferred embodiments, LTRPC3i polynucleotides and polypeptides of the present invention, including agonists and\/or fragments thereof, have uses that include, modulating cell proliferation, differentiation, migration, activation, exocytosis, muscle contraction, gene expression, apoptosis. signalling, pheromone sensory signaling, smooth muscle tone, pain perception, heat perception, osmosenstivity, and mechanosensitivity.","In more preferred embodiments, LTRPC3i polynucleotides and polypeptides of the present invention, including agonists and\/or fragments thereof, have uses that include, treating, ameliorating, preventing, detecting, and\/or prognosing various diseases and disorders, particularly the following, non-limiting examples, disorders of the skin, skeletal-muscle, nervous, cardiac, and vascular systems, in addition to the following, non-limiting diseases and disorders, which include, for example, arteriosclerosis, neointimal hypoerplasia, metastatic melanomas, bipolar disorder, nonsyndromic hereditary deafness, Knobloch syndrome, holosencephaly, and various maligancies including prostate cancer.","LTRPC3i polynucleotides and polypeptides of the present invention, including agonists and\/or fragments may be involved in intracellular Ca homeostasis which affects various aspects of biological functions including mechano-regulation, pain transduction, vasorelaxation, gene expression, cell cycle and proliferation\/apoptosis. Since the LTRPC3 variant is dominantly expressed in kidney, the LTRPC3i polypeptide may particularly play an important role in regulating cytosolic Ca2+ in the renal system, potentially Ca2+ absorption.","The LTRPC3i gene maps to chromosome 9q21.11-21.31 between the two markers D9S1874 and D9S1807. This region is linked to amyotrophic lateral sclerosis with frontotemporal dementia, early-onset pulverulent cataract, infantile nephronophthisis, hypomagnesemia with secondary hypocalcemia (HSH), and familial hemophagocytic lymphohistiocytosis. Therefore, agonists and\/or antagonists of the novel LTRPC3i can be used to treat diseases including various forms of neuronal degeneration, neurogenic inflammation, allergy, immunodeficiency\/excessive immune activation, visual defects, hearing disorder, pain, cancer, hypertension and other cardiovascular diseases. In addition, the therapeutics may be useful in the treatment of diseases associated with disturbances in Ca homeostasis including osteoporosis, hypercalciuric stone disease, and chronic renal failure.","Moreover, given the selective expression in kidney, LTRPC3i could be considered a candidate gene for HSH, since the phenotype is a renal insufficiency. LTRPC3i chromosomal location is \u02dc600 kb downstream of a X;9 translocation breakpoint interval described for one patient with HSH (6, 1491-1497, (1997)). Recently, two groups reported that a new member of the TRPM subfamily, TRPM6, expressed in both intestinal tissues and kidney, is associated with HSH (31, 166-170, (2002); and 31, 171-174 (2002)). Indeed, LTRPC3i is \u02dc4 mb 5\u2032 to TRPM6 on 9q21. Although TRPM6 is the first component identified for HSH, this should not preclude involvement of LTRPC3i in the disease. Therefore, it is possible that LTRPC3i may co-localize with TRPM6 and\/or forms a heteromultimer with TRPM6 in the kidney.","The kidney plays a major role in Ca homeostasis (reviewed in 75, 429-471, (1995)). LTRPC3i may play a direct role in Ca absorption due to its constitutive Ca permeability. Alternatively, LTRPC3i may be the SOC that regulates Ca absorption. In kidney, Ca absorption is regulated by agonists such as calcitonin, parathyroid hormone and parathyroid hormone-related peptide through their respective G protein-coupled receptors, and downstream SOCs. Additionally, in kidney a SOC has been described (276, 25759-25765, (2001)) for the action of angiotensin II, a vasoactive peptide that plays a major role in regulating blood pressure.","In addition, LTRPC3i polynucleotides and polypeptides of the present invention, including agonists and\/or fragments thereof, have uses that include modulating intracellular Ca++ ion concentrations, Ca++ ion flux, stored intracellular Ca++ ion concentrations, Ca++ ion pump activity, Ca++ ion flow into cell, Ca++ ion flow out of cells, the activation of Ca++ sensitive proteins, the activation of Ca++ sensitive signaling pathways, the activation of kinase-activatible proteins, and the activation of kinase-dependent signaling pathways.","The LTRPC3i polynucleotides and polypeptides of the present invention, including agonists and\/or fragments thereof, have uses that include modulating proliferation, differentiation, migration, and activation in various cells, tissues, and organisms, and particularly in mammalian kidney, spinal cord, testis, and brain, preferably human. LTRPC3i polynucleotides and polypeptides of the present invention, including agonists and\/or fragments thereof, may be useful in diagnosing, treating, prognosing, and\/or preventing renal, neural, and\/or proliferative diseases or disorders, particularly of the renal system.","In addition, antagonists of the LTRPC3i polynucleotides and polypeptides, including modulators or fragments thereof, may have uses that include diagnosing, treating, prognosing, and\/or preventing diseases or disorders related to transient receptor potential channel activity, which may include renal, neural, reproductive, and\/or proliferative diseases or disorders.","Although it is believed the encoded polypeptide may share at least some biological activities with transient receptor potential channel family members, particularly those melastatin1, a number of methods of determining the exact biological function of this clone are either known in the art or are described elsewhere herein. Briefly, the function of this clone may be determined by applying microarray methodology. Nucleic acids corresponding to the LTRPC3i polynucleotides, in addition to, other clones of the present invention, may be arrayed on microchips for expression profiling. Depending on which polynucleotide probe is used to hybridize to the slides, a change in expression of a specific gene may provide additional insight into the function of this gene based upon the conditions being studied. For example, an observed increase or decrease in expression levels when the polynucleotide probe used comes from tissue that has been treated with known transient potential receptor inhibitors, which include, but are not limited to the drugs listed herein or otherwise known in the art, might indicate a function in modulating transient potential receptor function, for example. In the case of LTRPC3i, kidney, spinal cord, testis, and brain, should be used to extract RNA to prepare the probe.","In addition, the function of the protein may be assessed by applying quantitative PCR methodology, for example. Real time quantitative PCR would provide the capability of following the expression of the LTRPC3i gene throughout development, for example. Quantitative PCR methodology requires only a nominal amount of tissue from each developmentally important step is needed to perform such experiments. Therefore, the application of quantitative PCR methodology to refining the biological function of this polypeptide is encompassed by the present invention. Also encompassed by the present invention are quantitative PCR probes corresponding to the polynucleotide sequence provided as SEQ ID NO:1 ().","The function of the protein may also be assessed through complementation assays in yeast. For example, in the case of the LTRPC3i, transforming yeast deficient in transient receptor potential channel activity with LTRPC3i and assessing their ability to grow would provide convincing evidence the LTRPC3i polypeptide has transient receptor potential channel activity. Additional assay conditions and methods that may be used in assessing the function of the polynucletides and polypeptides of the present invention are known in the art, some of which are disclosed elsewhere herein.","Alternatively, the biological function of the encoded polypeptide may be determined by disrupting a homologue of this polypeptide in Mice and\/or rats and observing the resulting phenotype.","Moreover, the biological function of this polypeptide may be determined by the application of antisense and\/or sense methodology and the resulting generation of transgenic mice and\/or rats. Expressing a particular gene in either sense or antisense orientation in a transgenic mouse or rat could lead to respectively higher or lower expression levels of that particular gene. Altering the endogenous expression levels of a gene can lead to the observation of a particular phenotype that can then be used to derive indications on the function of the gene. The gene can be either over-expressed or under expressed in every cell of the organism at all times using a strong ubiquitous promoter, or it could be expressed in one or more discrete parts of the organism using a well characterized tissue-specific promoter (e.g., a kidney, spinal cord, testis, and\/or brain-specific promoter), or it can be expressed at a specified time of development using an inducible and\/or a developmentally regulated promoter.","In the case of LTRPC3i transgenic mice or rats, if no phenotype is apparent in normal growth conditions, observing the organism under diseased conditions (renal, reproductive, neural, or proliferative disorders, etc.) may lead to understanding the function of the gene. Therefore, the application of antisense and\/or sense methodology to the creation of transgenic mice or rats to refine the biological function of the polypeptide is encompassed by the present invention.","In preferred embodiments, the following N-terminal LTRPC3i deletion polypeptides are encompassed by the present invention: M1-T1721, G2-T1721, K3-T1721, K4-T1721, W5-T1721, R6-T1721, D7-T1721, A8-T1721, A9-T1721, E10-T1721, M11-T1721, E12-T1721, R13-T1721, G14-T1721, C15-T1721, S16-T1721, D17-T1721, R18-T1721, E19-T1721, D20-T1721, N21-T1721, A22-T1721, E23-T1721, S24-T1721, R25-T1721, R26-T1721, R27-T1721, S28-T1721, R29-T1721, S30-T1721, A31-T1721, S32-T1721, R33-T1721, G34-T1721, R35-T1721, F36-T1721, A37-T1721, E38-T1721, S39-T1721, W40-T1721, K41-T1721, R42-T1721, L43-T1721, S44-T1721, S45-T1721, K46-T1721, Q47-T1721, G48-T1721, S49-T1721, T50-T1721, K51-T1721, R52-T1721, S53-T1721, G54-T1721, L55-T1721, P56-T1721, S57-T1721, Q58-T1721, Q59-T1721, T60-T1721, P61-T1721, A62-T1721, Q63-T1721, K64-T1721, S65-T1721, W66-T1721, I67-T1721, E68-T1721, R69-T1721, A70-T1721, F71-T1721, Y72-T1721, K73-T1721, R74-T1721, E75-T1721, C76-T1721, V77-T1721, H78-T1721, I79-T1721, I80-T1721, P81-T1721, S82-T1721, T83-T1721, K84-T1721, D85-T1721, P86-T1721, H87-T1721, R88-T1721, C89-T1721, C90-T1721, C91-T1721, G92-T1721, R93-T1721, L94-T1721, I95-T1721, G96-T1721, Q97-T1721, H98-T1721, V99-T1721, G100-T1721, L101-T1721, T102-T1721, P103-T1721, S104-T1721, 1105-T1721, S106-T1721, V107-T1721, L108-T1721, Q109-T1721, N110-T1721, E11-T1721, K112-T1721, N113-T1721, E114-T1721, S115-T1721, R116-T1721, L117-T1721, S118-T1721, R119-T1721, N120-T1721, D121-T1721, 1122-T1721, Q123-T1721, S124-T1721, E125-T1721, K126-T1721, W127-T1721, S128-T1721, I129-T1721, S130-T1721, K131-T1721, H132-T1721, T133-T1721, Q134-T1721, L135-T1721, S136-T1721, P137-T1721, T138-T1721, D139-T1721, A140-T1721, F141-T1721, G142-T1721, T143-T1721, I144-T1721, E145-T1721, F146-T1721, Q147-T1721, G148-T1721, G149-T1721, G150-T1721, H151-T1721, S152-T1721, N153-T1721, K154-T1721, and\/or A155-T1721 of SEQ ID NO:6.

For example, internal regions could be defined by the equation: amino acid NX to amino acid CX, wherein NX refers to any N-terminal deletion polypeptide amino acid of LTRPC3i (SEQ ID NO:6), and where CX refers to any C-terminal deletion polypeptide amino acid of LTRPC3i (SEQ ID NO:6).

An alignment of the LTRPC3j polypeptide with this protein is provided in .","The LTRPC3j polypeptide was determined to share 65.4% identity and 73.3% similarity with the human melastatin 1 protein (Melastatin1; Genbank Accession No. gi|3243075; SEQ ID NO:13) as shown in .","The LTRPC3j protein is believed to represent a member of a new class of protein kinases referred to as alpha kinases (Curr. Biol. 9 (2), R43-R45 (1999)). These kinases represent a novel type of signaling molecule comprising both a catalytic protein kinase domain, in addition to, an ion channel domain. This family is commonly referred to as the transient receptor potential channel (TRP) family. Melastatin1 defines a separate subfamily of TRP channels referred to as TRPM (melastatin1).

As such, LTRPC3 behaves in a manner similar to a tumor suppressor, in that loss results in increases in proliferation. While some increases in the proliferation markers p21 and IkB were also observed, they were less significant, and could be a response to the pro-proliferative effect of LTRPC3 antisense inhibition. Interestingly, expression of LTRPC3 was also observed to be significantly reduced in tumor tissues, relative to normal tissues (see ). Specifically, renal, testicular, and ovarian tumor samples showed as much as 12 to 30 fold down regulation of LTRPC3 message levels compared to normal tissues. This reduction of LTRPC3 correlating with the tumor state is consistent with the negative FEN1 modulatory activity and suggests this gene may have antiproliferative activities. Therefore, for modulators of LTRPC3j to be useful for treating cancer, it would be necessary to increase the activity of the gene or gene product in order to have the reverse effect on cancerous cells.

Representative uses are described in the \u201cRegeneration\u201d and \u201cHyperproliferative Disorders\u201d sections below, in the Examples, and elsewhere herein. Briefly, the uses include, but are not limited to the detection, treatment, and\/or prevention of Alzheimer's Disease, Parkinson's Disease, Huntington's Disease, Tourette Syndrome, meningitis, encephalitis, demyelinating diseases, peripheral neuropathies, neoplasia, trauma, congenital malformations, spinal cord injuries, ischemia and infarction, aneurysms, hemorrhages, schizophrenia, mania, dementia, paranoia, obsessive compulsive disorder, depression, panic disorder, learning disabilities, ALS, psychoses, autism, and altered behaviors, including disorders in feeding, sleep patterns, balance, and perception. In addition, elevated expression of this gene product in regions of the brain indicates it plays a role in normal neural function.

Therefore, this gene product may be expressed in other specific tissues or organs where it may play related functional roles in other processes, such as hematopoiesis, inflammation, bone formation, and kidney function, to name a few possible target indications.","Several known TRP family members have been identified that are expressed significantly in testis tissue. These TRP family members include, for example, polycystin-L2 (Guo, L., Schreiber, T, H., Weremowicz, S., Morton, C, C., Lee, C., Zhou, J. Genomics., 64(3):241-51, (2000)); TRP7 (Okada, T., Inoue, R., Yamazaki, K., Maeda, A., Kurosaki, T., Yamakuni, T., Tanaka, I., Shimizu, S., Ikenaka, K., Imoto, K., Mori, Y, J.

Moreover, transient receptor potential channel family members have been implicated in disorders of the skin, skeletal-muscle, nervous, cardiac, and vascular systems, in addition to the following, non-limiting diseases and disorders, which include, for example, arteriosclerosis, neointimal hypoerplasia, metastatic melanomas, bipolar disorder, nonsyndromic hereditary deafness, Knobloch syndrome, holosencephaly, and various maligancies including prostate cancer.","In preferred embodiments, LTRPC3j polynucleotides and polypeptides of the present invention, including agonists and\/or fragments thereof, have uses that include, modulating cell proliferation, differentiation, migration, activation, exocytosis, muscle contraction, gene expression, apoptosis. signalling, pheromone sensory signaling, smooth muscle tone, pain perception, heat perception, osmosenstivity, and mechanosensitivity.","In more preferred embodiments, LTRPC3j polynucleotides and polypeptides of the present invention, including agonists and\/or fragments thereof, have uses that include, treating, ameliorating, preventing, detecting, and\/or prognosing various diseases and disorders, particularly the following, non-limiting examples, disorders of the skin, skeletal-muscle, nervous, cardiac, and vascular systems, in addition to the following, non-limiting diseases and disorders, which include, for example, arteriosclerosis, neointimal hypoerplasia, metastatic melanomas, bipolar disorder, nonsyndromic hereditary deafness, Knobloch syndrome, holosencephaly, and various maligancies including prostate cancer.","LTRPC3j polynucleotides and polypeptides of the present invention, including agonists and\/or fragments may be involved in intracellular Ca homeostasis which affects various aspects of biological functions including mechano-regulation, pain transduction, vasorelaxation, gene expression, cell cycle and proliferation\/apoptosis. Since the LTRPC3 variant is dominantly expressed in kidney, the LTRPC3j polypeptide may particularly play an important role in regulating cytosolic Ca2+ in the renal system, potentially Ca2+ absorption.","The LTRPC3j gene maps to chromosome 9q21.11-21.31 between the two markers D9S1874 and D9S1807. This region is linked to amyotrophic lateral sclerosis with frontotemporal dementia, early-onset pulverulent cataract, infantile nephronophthisis, hypomagnesemia with secondary hypocalcemia (HSH), and familial hemophagocytic lymphohistiocytosis. Therefore, agonists and\/or antagonists of the novel LTRPC3j can be used to treat diseases including various forms of neuronal degeneration, neurogenic inflammation, allergy, immunodeficiency\/excessive immune activation, visual defects, hearing disorder, pain, cancer, hypertension and other cardiovascular diseases. In addition, the therapeutics may be useful in the treatment of diseases associated with disturbances in Ca homeostasis including osteoporosis, hypercalciuric stone disease, and chronic renal failure.","Moreover, given the selective expression in kidney, LTRPC3j could be considered a candidate gene for HSH, since the phenotype is a renal insufficiency. LTRPC3j chromosomal location is \u02dc600 kb downstream of a X;9 translocation breakpoint interval described for one patient with HSH (6, 1491-1497, (1997)). Recently, two groups reported that a new member of the TRPM subfamily, TRPM6, expressed in both intestinal tissues and kidney, is associated with HSH (31, 166-170, (2002); and 31, 171-174 (2002)). Indeed, LTRPC3j is \u02dc4 mb 5\u2032 to TRPM6 on 9q21. Although TRPM6 is the first component identified for HSH, this should not preclude involvement of LTRPC3j in the disease. Therefore, it is possible that LTRPC3j may co-localize with TRPM6 and\/or forms a heteromultimer with TRPM6 in the kidney.","The kidney plays a major role in Ca homeostasis (reviewed in 75, 429-471, (1995)). LTRPC3j may play a direct role in Ca absorption due to its constitutive Ca permeability. Alternatively, LTRPC3j may be the SOC that regulates Ca absorption. In kidney, Ca absorption is regulated by agonists such as calcitonin, parathyroid hormone and parathyroid hormone-related peptide through their respective G protein-coupled receptors, and downstream SOCs. Additionally, in kidney a SOC has been described (276, 25759-25765, (2001)) for the action of angiotensin II, a vasoactive peptide that plays a major role in regulating blood pressure.","In addition, LTRPC3j polynucleotides and polypeptides of the present invention, including agonists and\/or fragments thereof, have uses that include modulating intracellular Ca++ ion concentrations, Ca++ ion flux, stored intracellular Ca++ ion concentrations, Ca++ ion pump activity, Ca++ ion flow into cell, Ca++ ion flow out of cells, the activation of Ca++ sensitive proteins, the activation of Ca++ sensitive signaling pathways, the activation of kinase-activatible proteins, and the activation of kinase-dependent signaling pathways.","The LTRPC3j polynucleotides and polypeptides of the present invention, including agonists and\/or fragments thereof, have uses that include modulating proliferation, differentiation, migration, and activation in various cells, tissues, and organisms, and particularly in mammalian kidney, spinal cord, testis, and brain, preferably human. LTRPC3j polynucleotides and polypeptides of the present invention, including agonists and\/or fragments thereof, may be useful in diagnosing, treating, prognosing, and\/or preventing renal, neural, and\/or proliferative diseases or disorders, particularly of the renal system.","In addition, antagonists of the LTRPC3j polynucleotides and polypeptides, including modulators or fragments thereof, may have uses that include diagnosing, treating, prognosing, and\/or preventing diseases or disorders related to transient receptor potential channel activity, which may include renal, neural, reproductive, and\/or proliferative diseases or disorders.","Although it is believed the encoded polypeptide may share at least some biological activities with transient receptor potential channel family members, particularly those melastatin1, a number of methods of determining the exact biological function of this clone are either known in the art or are described elsewhere herein. Briefly, the function of this clone may be determined by applying microarray methodology. Nucleic acids corresponding to the LTRPC3j polynucleotides, in addition to, other clones of the present invention, may be arrayed on microchips for expression profiling. Depending on which polynucleotide probe is used to hybridize to the slides, a change in expression of a specific gene may provide additional insight into the function of this gene based upon the conditions being studied. For example, an observed increase or decrease in expression levels when the polynucleotide probe used comes from tissue that has been treated with known transient potential receptor inhibitors, which include, but are not limited to the drugs listed herein or otherwise known in the art, might indicate a function in modulating transient potential receptor function, for example. In the case of LTRPC3j, kidney, spinal cord, testis, and brain, should be used to extract RNA to prepare the probe.","In addition, the function of the protein may be assessed by applying quantitative PCR methodology, for example. Real time quantitative PCR would provide the capability of following the expression of the LTRPC3j gene throughout development, for example. Quantitative PCR methodology requires only a nominal amount of tissue from each developmentally important step is needed to perform such experiments. Therefore, the application of quantitative PCR methodology to refining the biological function of this polypeptide is encompassed by the present invention. Also encompassed by the present invention are quantitative PCR probes corresponding to the polynucleotide sequence provided as SEQ ID NO:1 ().","The function of the protein may also be assessed through complementation assays in yeast. For example, in the case of the LTRPC3j, transforming yeast deficient in transient receptor potential channel activity with LTRPC3j and assessing their ability to grow would provide convincing evidence the LTRPC3j polypeptide has transient receptor potential channel activity. Additional assay conditions and methods that may be used in assessing the function of the polynucletides and polypeptides of the present invention are known in the art, some of which are disclosed elsewhere herein.","Alternatively, the biological function of the encoded polypeptide may be determined by disrupting a homologue of this polypeptide in Mice and\/or rats and observing the resulting phenotype.","Moreover, the biological function of this polypeptide may be determined by the application of antisense and\/or sense methodology and the resulting generation of transgenic mice and\/or rats. Expressing a particular gene in either sense or antisense orientation in a transgenic mouse or rat could lead to respectively higher or lower expression levels of that particular gene. Altering the endogenous expression levels of a gene can lead to the observation of a particular phenotype that can then be used to derive indications on the function of the gene. The gene can be either over-expressed or under expressed in every cell of the organism at all times using a strong ubiquitous promoter, or it could be expressed in one or more discrete parts of the organism using a well characterized tissue-specific promoter (e.g., a kidney, spinal cord, testis, and\/or brain-specific promoter), or it can be expressed at a specified time of development using an inducible and\/or a developmentally regulated promoter.","In the case of LTRPC3j transgenic mice or rats, if no phenotype is apparent in normal growth conditions, observing the organism under diseased conditions (renal, reproductive, neural, or proliferative disorders, etc.) may lead to understanding the function of the gene. Therefore, the application of antisense and\/or sense methodology to the creation of transgenic mice or rats to refine the biological function of the polypeptide is encompassed by the present invention.","In preferred embodiments, the following N-terminal LTRPC3j deletion polypeptides are encompassed by the present invention: M1-T1699, G2-T1699, K3-T1699, K4-T1699, W5-T1699, R6-T1699, D7-T1699, A8-T1699, A9-T1699, E10-T1699, M11-T1699, E12-T1699, R13-T1699, G14-T1699, C15-T1699, S16-T1699, D17-T1699, R18-T1699, E19-T1699, D20-T1699, N21-T1699, A22-T1699, E23-T1699, S24-T1699, R25-T1699, R26-T1699, R27-T1699, S28-T1699, R29-T1699, S30-T1699, A31-T1699, S32-T1699, R33-T1699, G34-T1699, R35-T1699, F36-T1699, A37-T1699, E38-T1699, S39-T1699, W40-T1699, K41-T1699, R42-T1699, L43-T1699, S44-T1699, S45-T1699, K46-T1699, Q47-T1699, G48-T1699, S49-T1699, T50-T1699, K51-T1699, R52-T1699, S53-T1699, G54-T1699, L55-T1699, P56-T1699, S57-T1699, Q58-T1699, Q59-T1699, T60-T1699, P61-T1699, A62-T1699, Q63-T1699, K64-T1699, S65-T1699, W66-T1699, I67-T1699, E68-T1699, R69-T1699, A70-T1699, F71-T1699, Y72-T1699, K73-T1699, R74-T1699, E75-T1699, C76-T1699, V77-T1699, H78-T1699, I79-T1699, I80-T1699, P81-T1699, S82-T699, T83-T1699, K84-T1699, D85-T1699, P86-T1699, H87-T1699, R88-T1699, C89-T1699, C90-T1699, C91-T1699, G92-T1699, R93-T1699, L94-T1699, I95-T1699, G96-T1699, Q97-T1699, H98-T1699, V99-T1699, G100-T1699, L101-T1699, T102-T1699, P103-T1699, S104-T1699, I105-T1699, S106-T1699, V107-T1699, L108-T1699, Q109-T1699, N100-T1699, E11\u2032-T1699, K112-T0699, N113-T1699, E114-T1699, S115-T1699, R116-T1699, L117-T1699, S118-T1699, R119-T1699, N120-T1699, D121-T1699, 1122-T1699, Q123-T1699, S124-T1699, E125-T1699, K126-T1699, W127-T1699, S128-T1699, I129-T1699, S130-T1699, K131-T1699, H132-T1699, T133-T1699, Q134-T1699, L135-T1699, S136-T1699, P137-T1699, T138-T1699, D139-T1699, A140-T1699, F141-T1699, G142-T1699, T143-T1699, I144-T1699, E145-T1699, F146-T1699, Q147-T1699, G148-T1699, G149-T1699, G150-T1699, H151-T1699, S152-T1699, N153-T1699, K154-T1699, and\/or A155-T1699 of SEQ ID NO:8.

Polynucleotide sequences encoding these polypeptides are also provided. The present invention also encompasses the use of these C-terminal LTRPC3j deletion polypeptides as immunogenic and\/or antigenic epitopes as described elsewhere herein.","Alternatively, preferred polypeptides of the present invention may comprise polypeptide sequences corresponding to, for example, internal regions of the LTRPC3j polypeptide (e.g., any combination of both N- and C-terminal LTRPC3j polypeptide deletions) of SEQ ID NO:8. For example, internal regions could be defined by the equation: amino acid NX to amino acid CX, wherein NX refers to any N-terminal deletion polypeptide amino acid of LTRPC3j (SEQ ID NO:8), and where CX refers to any C-terminal deletion polypeptide amino acid of LTRPC3j (SEQ ID NO:8). Polynucleotides encoding these polypeptides are also provided. The present invention also encompasses the use of these polypeptides as an immunogenic and\/or antigenic epitope as described elsewhere herein.","Many polynucleotide sequences, such as EST sequences, are publicly available and accessible through sequence databases. Some of these sequences are related to SEQ ID NO:7 and may have been publicly available prior to conception of the present invention. Preferably, such related polynucleotides are specifically excluded from the scope of the present invention. To list every related sequence would be cumbersome. Accordingly, preferably excluded from the present invention are one or more polynucleotides consisting of a nucleotide sequence described by the general formula of a-b, where a is any integer between 1 to 5157 of SEQ ID NO:7, b is an integer between 15 to 5171, where both a and b correspond to the positions of nucleotide residues shown in SEQ ID NO:7, and where b is greater than or equal to a+14.","The polypeptide of this gene provided as SEQ ID NO:10 (), encoded by the polynucleotide sequence according to SEQ ID NO:9 (), and\/or encoded by the polynucleotide contained within the deposited clone, LTRPC3k, has significant homology at the nucleotide and amino acid level to the human melastatin 1 protein (Melastatin1; Genbank Accession No. gi|3243075; SEQ ID NO:13). An alignment of the LTRPC3k polypeptide with this protein is provided in .","The LTRPC3k polypeptide was determined to share 65.5% identity and 73.3% similarity with the human melastatin 1 protein (Melastatin1; Genbank Accession No. gi|3243075; SEQ ID NO:13) as shown in .","The LTRPC3k protein is believed to represent a member of a new class of protein kinases referred to as alpha kinases (Curr. Biol. 9 (2), R43-R45 (1999)). These kinases represent a novel type of signaling molecule comprising both a catalytic protein kinase domain, in addition to, an ion channel domain. This family is commonly referred to as the transient receptor potential channel (TRP) family. Melastatin1 defines a separate subfamily of TRP channels referred to as TRPM (melastatin1). TRPM family members are characteristic of their unusually long cytoplasmic tails at both ends of the channel domain and some of the family members contain an enzyme domain at the C-terminal region.","Specifically, the LTRPC3k (SEQ ID NO:10) polypeptide represents a novel variant of the LTRPC3e (U.S. Ser. No. 10\/210,152, filed Aug. 1, 2002; International Publication No. WO 03\/012063, published Feb. 13, 2003; SEQ ID NO:20; and also U.S. Ser. No. 10\/405,793, filed Mar. 28, 2003; which are hereby incorporated by reference herein in their entirety) polypeptide. The LTRPC3k represents a novel member of the TRPM subfamily.","The melastatin1 protein is believed to be negatively associated with the incidence of melanoma based upon its inverse correlative expression in highly aggressive melanomas (Genomics 54 (1), 116-123 (1998)). Thus, overexpression of melastatin1 could represent a novel therapeutic in the treatment of melanoma and potentially other cancers.","Based upon the observed homology, the polypeptide of the present invention is expected to share at least some biological activity with other transient receptor potential channel family members, more specifically with the melastatin1 protein, in addition to, other transient receptor potential channel family members referenced elsewhere herein or otherwise known in the art, particularly LTRPC3e, and LTRPC3.","Most of the known transient receptor potential channel family members, possess one or more transmembrane domains. Likewise, the LTRPC3k polypeptide has been determined to comprise six transmembrane domains (TM1-TM6) as shown in . The transmembrane domains are located from about amino acid 777 to about amino acid 794 (TM1), from about amino acid 874 to about amino acid 891 (TM2), from about amino acid 947 to about amino acid 960 (TM3), from about amino acid 974 to about amino acid 991 (TM4), from about amino acid 1008 to about amino acid 1025 (TM5), and\/or from about amino acid 1095 to about amino acid 1115 (TM6) of SEQ ID NO:10.

Such regions are typically solvent accessible (either extracellularly or intracellularly). Therefore, these regions are amenable to the development of agonists and\/or antagonists to the LTRPC3k polypeptide, particularly for the development of antibodies specific to these regions.","In preferred embodiments, the following inter-transmembrane domain polypeptides are encompassed by the present invention: KNKDDMPYMSQAQEIHLQEKEAEEPEKPTKEKEEEDMELTAMLGRNNGESS RKKDEEEVQSKHRLIPLGRKIYEFYNAP (SEQ ID NO:84), NYIVLVKMERWPSTQEWIVISYIFTLGIEKMREILMSEPGKLLQKVKVWLQEY WN (SEQ ID NO:85), ILRLQDQPFRSDG (SEQ ID NO:86), FGVNKYLGPYVMMIGK (SEQ ID NO:87), and\/or FGVARQAILFPNEEPSWKLAKNIFYMPYWMIYGEVFADQIDRKQVYDSHTPK SAPCGQNETREDGKIIQLPPCKTGAWIVP (SEQ ID NO:88).

As such, LTRPC3 behaves in a manner similar to a tumor suppressor, in that loss results in increases in proliferation. While some increases in the proliferation markers p21 and IkB were also observed, they were less significant, and could be a response to the pro-proliferative effect of LTRPC3 antisense inhibition. Interestingly, expression of LTRPC3 was also observed to be significantly reduced in tumor tissues, relative to normal tissues (see ). Specifically, renal, testicular, and ovarian tumor samples showed as much as 12 to 30 fold down regulation of LTRPC3 message levels compared to normal tissues. This reduction of LTRPC3 correlating with the tumor state is consistent with the negative FEN1 modulatory activity and suggests this gene may have antiproliferative activities. Therefore, for modulators of LTRPC3k to be useful for treating cancer, it would be necessary to increase the activity of the gene or gene product in order to have the reverse effect on cancerous cells. Thus, an agonist of LTRPC3k activity or a compound that increased LTRPC3k message levels would be a desired invention for cancer therapy.","In preferred embodiments, LTRPC3k polynucleotides and polypeptides, including fragments and modulators thereof, are useful for treating, diagnosing, and\/or ameliorating DNA-repair deficiencies, particularly base-excision repair deficiencies, Xeroderma pigmentosum, skin cancer, melanoma, UV senstivity, alkylation sensivity, gamma irradiation sensitivity, pyrimidine dimer sensitivity, chemical mutagenes, lymphomas, leukemias, photosensitivity, Bloom's syndrone, Fanconi's anemia, ataxia telangiectasia, chromosomal aberrations, blood vessel dilation aberrations in the skin, blood vessel dilation aberrations in the eye, conditions involving increased levels of apurinic sites, conditions involving increased levels of apyrimidinic sites, conditions involving increased levels of abasic sites, disorders related to aberrant signal transduction, proliferating disorders, and\/or cancers.","Moreover, LTRPC3k polynucleotides and polypeptides, including fragments and modulators thereof, are useful for increasing mammalian base excision repair activity, increasing mammalian single-nucleotide base excision repair activity, and\/or increasing mammalian long patch base excision repair activity.","In preferred embodiments, antagonists directed against LTRPC3k are useful for treating, diagnosing, and\/or ameliorating DNA-repair deficiencies, particularly base-excision repair deficiencies, Xeroderma pigmentosum, skin cancer, melanoma, UV senstivity, alkylation sensivity, gamma irradiation sensitivity, pyrimidine dimer sensitivity, chemical mutagenes, lymphomas, leukemias, photosensitivity, Bloom's syndrone, Fanconi's anemia, ataxia telangiectasia, chromosomal aberrations, blood vessel dilation aberrations in the skin, blood vessel dilation aberrations in the eye, conditions involving increased levels of apurinic sites, conditions involving increased levels of apyrimidinic sites, conditions involving increased levels of abasic sites, disorders related to aberrant signal transduction, proliferating disorders, and\/or cancers.","Moreover, antagonists directed against LTRPC3k are useful for increasing mammalian base excision repair activity, increasing mammalian single-nucleotide base excision repair activity, and\/or increasing mammalian long patch base excision repair activity.","In preferred embodiments, agonists directed against LTRPC3k are useful for treating, diagnosing, and\/or ameliorating, disorders related to aberrant signal transduction, proliferating disorders, and\/or cancers, particularly renal cell carcinomas, testicular cancers, and\/or ovarian cancers.","Moreover, agonists directed against LTRPC3k are useful for decreasing mammalian base excision repair activity, decreasing mammalian single-nucleotide base excision repair activity, and\/or decreasing mammalian long patch base excision repair activity.","The strong homology to human transient receptor potential channels (TRP), combined with the predominate localized expression in kidney tissue of the LTRPC3 variant, suggests the LTRPC3k polynucleotides and polypeptides, including modulators or fragments thereof, may be useful in treating, diagnosing, prognosing, and\/or preventing renal diseases and\/or disorders, which include, but are not limited to: nephritis, renal failure, nephrotic syndrome, urinary tract infection, hematuria, proteinuria, oliguria, polyuria, nocturia, edema, hypertension, electrolyte disorders, sterile pyuria, renal osteodystrophy, large kidneys, renal transport defects, nephrolithiasis, azotemia, anuria, urinary retention, slowing of urinary stream, large prostate, flank tenderness, full bladder sensation after voiding, enuresis, dysuria, bacteriuria, kideny stones, glomerulonephritis, vasculitis, hemolytic uremic syndromes, thrombotic thrombocytopenic purpura, malignant hypertension, casts, tubulointerstitial kidney diseases, renal tubular acidosis, pyelonephritis, hydronephritis, nephrotic syndrome, crush syndrome, and\/or renal colic, in addition to Wilm's Tumor Disease, and congenital kidney abnormalities such as horseshoe kidney, polycystic kidney, and Falconi's syndrome. for example.","Several known TRP family members have been identified that are expressed significantly in kidney tissue.

Representative uses are described in the \u201cRegeneration\u201d and \u201cHyperproliferative Disorders\u201d sections below, in the Examples, and elsewhere herein. Briefly, the uses include, but are not limited to the detection, treatment, and\/or prevention of Alzheimer's Disease, Parkinson's Disease, Huntington's Disease, Tourette Syndrome, meningitis, encephalitis, demyelinating diseases, peripheral neuropathies, neoplasia, trauma, congenital malformations, spinal cord injuries, ischemia and infarction, aneurysms, hemorrhages, schizophrenia, mania, dementia, paranoia, obsessive compulsive disorder, depression, panic disorder, learning disabilities, ALS, psychoses, autism, and altered behaviors, including disorders in feeding, sleep patterns, balance, and perception.

The testes are also a site of active gene expression of transcripts that is expressed, particularly at low levels, in other tissues of the body. Therefore, this gene product may be expressed in other specific tissues or organs where it may play related functional roles in other processes, such as hematopoiesis, inflammation, bone formation, and kidney function, to name a few possible target indications.","Several known TRP family members have been identified that are expressed significantly in testis tissue. These TRP family members include, for example, polycystin-L2 (Guo, L., Schreiber, T, H., Weremowicz, S., Morton, C, C., Lee, C., Zhou, J. Genomics., 64(3):241-51, (2000)); TRP7 (Okada, T., Inoue, R., Yamazaki, K., Maeda, A., Kurosaki, T., Yamakuni, T., Tanaka, I., Shimizu, S., Ikenaka, K., Imoto, K., Mori, Y, J.

Moreover, transient receptor potential channel family members have been implicated in disorders of the skin, skeletal-muscle, nervous, cardiac, and vascular systems, in addition to the following, non-limiting diseases and disorders, which include, for example, arteriosclerosis, neointimal hypoerplasia, metastatic melanomas, bipolar disorder, nonsyndromic hereditary deafness, Knobloch syndrome, holosencephaly, and various maligancies including prostate cancer.","In preferred embodiments, LTRPC3k polynucleotides and polypeptides of the present invention, including agonists and\/or fragments thereof, have uses that include, modulating cell proliferation, differentiation, migration, activation, exocytosis, muscle contraction, gene expression, apoptosis. signalling, pheromone sensory signaling, smooth muscle tone, pain perception, heat perception, osmosenstivity, and mechanosensitivity.","In more preferred embodiments, LTRPC3k polynucleotides and polypeptides of the present invention, including agonists and\/or fragments thereof, have uses that include, treating, ameliorating, preventing, detecting, and\/or prognosing various diseases and disorders, particularly the following, non-limiting examples, disorders of the skin, skeletal-muscle, nervous, cardiac, and vascular systems, in addition to the following, non-limiting diseases and disorders, which include, for example, arteriosclerosis, neointimal hypoerplasia, metastatic melanomas, bipolar disorder, nonsyndromic hereditary deafness, Knobloch syndrome, holosencephaly, and various maligancies including prostate cancer.","LTRPC3k polynucleotides and polypeptides of the present invention, including agonists and\/or fragments may be involved in intracellular Ca homeostasis which affects various aspects of biological functions including mechano-regulation, pain transduction, vasorelaxation, gene expression, cell cycle and proliferation\/apoptosis. Since the LTRPC3 variant is dominantly expressed in kidney, the LTRPC3k polypeptide may particularly play an important role in regulating cytosolic Ca2+ in the renal system, potentially Ca2+ absorption.","The LTRPC3k gene maps to chromosome 9q21.11-21.31 between the two markers D9S1874 and D9S1807. This region is linked to amyotrophic lateral sclerosis with frontotemporal dementia, early-onset pulverulent cataract, infantile nephronophthisis, hypomagnesemia with secondary hypocalcemia (HSH), and familial hemophagocytic lymphohistiocytosis. Therefore, agonists and\/or antagonists of the novel LTRPC3k can be used to treat diseases including various forms of neuronal degeneration, neurogenic inflammation, allergy, immunodeficiency\/excessive immune activation, visual defects, hearing disorder, pain, cancer, hypertension and other cardiovascular diseases. In addition, the therapeutics may be useful in the treatment of diseases associated with disturbances in Ca homeostasis including osteoporosis, hypercalciuric stone disease, and chronic renal failure.","Moreover, given the selective expression in kidney, LTRPC3k could be considered a candidate gene for HSH, since the phenotype is a renal insufficiency. LTRPC3k chromosomal location is \u02dc600 kb downstream of a X;9 translocation breakpoint interval described for one patient with HSH (6, 1491-1497, (1997)). Recently, two groups reported that a new member of the TRPM subfamily, TRPM6, expressed in both intestinal tissues and kidney, is associated with HSH (31, 166-170, (2002); and 31, 171-174 (2002)). Indeed, LTRPC3k is \u02dc4 mb 5\u2032 to TRPM6 on 9q21. Although TRPM6 is the first component identified for HSH, this should not preclude involvement of LTRPC3k in the disease. Therefore, it is possible that LTRPC3k may co-localize with TRPM6 and\/or forms a heteromultimer with TRPM6 in the kidney.","The kidney plays a major role in Ca homeostasis (reviewed in 75, 429-471, (1995)). LTRPC3k may play a direct role in Ca absorption due to its constitutive Ca permeability. Alternatively, LTRPC3k may be the SOC that regulates Ca absorption. In kidney, Ca absorption is regulated by agonists such as calcitonin, parathyroid hormone and parathyroid hormone-related peptide through their respective G protein-coupled receptors, and downstream SOCs. Additionally, in kidney a SOC has been described (276, 25759-25765, (2001)) for the action of angiotensin II, a vasoactive peptide that plays a major role in regulating blood pressure.","In addition, LTRPC3k polynucleotides and polypeptides of the present invention, including agonists and\/or fragments thereof, have uses that include modulating intracellular Ca++ ion concentrations, Ca++ ion flux, stored intracellular Ca++ ion concentrations, Ca++ ion pump activity, Ca++ ion flow into cell, Ca++ ion flow out of cells, the activation of Ca++ sensitive proteins, the activation of Ca++ sensitive signaling pathways, the activation of kinase-activatible proteins, and the activation of kinase-dependent signaling pathways.","The LTRPC3k polynucleotides and polypeptides of the present invention, including agonists and\/or fragments thereof, have uses that include modulating proliferation, differentiation, migration, and activation in various cells, tissues, and organisms, and particularly in mammalian kidney, spinal cord, testis, and brain, preferably human. LTRPC3k polynucleotides and polypeptides of the present invention, including agonists and\/or fragments thereof, may be useful in diagnosing, treating, prognosing, and\/or preventing renal, neural, and\/or proliferative diseases or disorders, particularly of the renal system.","In addition, antagonists of the LTRPC3k polynucleotides and polypeptides, including modulators or fragments thereof, may have uses that include diagnosing, treating, prognosing, and\/or preventing diseases or disorders related to transient receptor potential channel activity, which may include renal, neural, reproductive, and\/or proliferative diseases or disorders.","Although it is believed the encoded polypeptide may share at least some biological activities with transient receptor potential channel family members, particularly those melastatin1, a number of methods of determining the exact biological function of this clone are either known in the art or are described elsewhere herein. Briefly, the function of this clone may be determined by applying microarray methodology. Nucleic acids corresponding to the LTRPC3k polynucleotides, in addition to, other clones of the present invention, may be arrayed on microchips for expression profiling. Depending on which polynucleotide probe is used to hybridize to the slides, a change in expression of a specific gene may provide additional insight into the function of this gene based upon the conditions being studied. For example, an observed increase or decrease in expression levels when the polynucleotide probe used comes from tissue that has been treated with known transient potential receptor inhibitors, which include, but are not limited to the drugs listed herein or otherwise known in the art, might indicate a function in modulating transient potential receptor function, for example. In the case of LTRPC3k, kidney, spinal cord, testis, and brain, should be used to extract RNA to prepare the probe.","In addition, the function of the protein may be assessed by applying quantitative PCR methodology, for example. Real time quantitative PCR would provide the capability of following the expression of the LTRPC3k gene throughout development, for example. Quantitative PCR methodology requires only a nominal amount of tissue from each developmentally important step is needed to perform such experiments. Therefore, the application of quantitative PCR methodology to refining the biological function of this polypeptide is encompassed by the present invention. Also encompassed by the present invention are quantitative PCR probes corresponding to the polynucleotide sequence provided as SEQ ID NO:1 ().","The function of the protein may also be assessed through complementation assays in yeast. For example, in the case of the LTRPC3k, transforming yeast deficient in transient receptor potential channel activity with LTRPC3k and assessing their ability to grow would provide convincing evidence the LTRPC3k polypeptide has transient receptor potential channel activity. Additional assay conditions and methods that may be used in assessing the function of the polynucletides and polypeptides of the present invention are known in the art, some of which are disclosed elsewhere herein.","Alternatively, the biological function of the encoded polypeptide may be determined by disrupting a homologue of this polypeptide in Mice and\/or rats and observing the resulting phenotype.","Moreover, the biological function of this polypeptide may be determined by the application of antisense and\/or sense methodology and the resulting generation of transgenic mice and\/or rats. Expressing a particular gene in either sense or antisense orientation in a transgenic mouse or rat could lead to respectively higher or lower expression levels of that particular gene. Altering the endogenous expression levels of a gene can lead to the observation of a particular phenotype that can then be used to derive indications on the function of the gene. The gene can be either over-expressed or under expressed in every cell of the organism at all times using a strong ubiquitous promoter, or it could be expressed in one or more discrete parts of the organism using a well characterized tissue-specific promoter (e.g., a kidney, spinal cord, testis, and\/or brain-specific promoter), or it can be expressed at a specified time of development using an inducible and\/or a developmentally regulated promoter.","In the case of LTRPC3k transgenic mice or rats, if no phenotype is apparent in normal growth conditions, observing the organism under diseased conditions (renal, reproductive, neural, or proliferative disorders, etc.) may lead to understanding the function of the gene. Therefore, the application of antisense and\/or sense methodology to the creation of transgenic mice or rats to refine the biological function of the polypeptide is encompassed by the present invention.","In preferred embodiments, the following N-terminal LTRPC3k deletion polypeptides are encompassed by the present invention: M1-T1711, G2-T1711, K3-T1711, K4-T1711, W5-T1711, R6-T1711, D7-T1711, A8-T1711, A9-T1711, E10-T1711, M1-T1711, E12-T1711, R13-T1711, G14-T1711, C15-T1711, S16-T1711, D17-T1711, R18-T1711, E19-T1711, D20-T1711, N21-T1711, A22-T1711, E23-T1711, S24-T1711, R25-T1711, R26-T1711, R27-T1711, S28-T1711, R29-T1711, S30-T1711, A31-T1711, S32-T1711, R33-T1711, G34-T1711, R35-T1711, F36-T1711, A37-T1711, E38-T1711, S39-T1711, W40-T1711, K41-T1711, R42-T1711, L43-T1711, S44-T1711, S45-T1711, K46-T1711, Q47-T1711, G48-T1711, S49-T1711, T50-T1711, K51-T1711, R52-T1711, S53-T1711, G54-T1711, L55-T1711, P56-T1711, S57-T1711, Q58-T1711, Q59-T1711, T60-T1711, P61-T1711, A62-T1711, Q63-T1711, K64-T1711, S65-T1711, W66-T1711, I67-T1711, E68-T1711, R69-T1711, A70-T1711, F71-T1711, Y72-T1711, K73-T1711, R74-T1711, E75-T1711, C76-T1711, V77-T1711, H78-T1711, I79-T1711, I80-T1711, P81-T1711, S82-T1711, T83-T1711, K84-T1711, D85-T1711, P86-T1711, H87-T1711, R88-T1711, C89-T1711, C90-T1711, C91-T1711, G92-T1711, R93-T1711, L94-T1711, 195-T1711, G96-T1711, Q97-T1711, H98-T1711, V99-T1711, G100-T1711, L101-T1711, T102-T1711, P103-T1711, S104-T1711, 1105-T1711, S106-T1711, V107-T1711, L108-T1711, Q109-T1711, N110-T1711, E11-T1711, K112-T1711, N113-T1711, E114-T1711, S115-T1711, R116-T1711, L117-T1711, S118-T1711, R119-T1711, N120-T1711, D121-T1711, I122-T1711, Q123-T1711, S124-T1711, E125-T1711, K126-T1711, W127-T1711, S128-T1711, I129-T1711, S130-T1711, K131-T1711, H132-T1711, T133-T1711, Q134-T1711, L135-T1711, S136-T1711, P137-T1711, T138-T1711, D139-T1711, A140-T1711, F141-T1711, G142-T1711, T143-T1711, I144-T1711, E145-T1711, F146-T1711, Q147-T1711, G148-T1711, G149-T1711, G150-T1711, H151-T1711, S152-T1711, N153-T1711, K154-T1711, and\/or A155-T1711 of SEQ ID NO:10.

Polynucleotide sequences encoding these polypeptides are also provided. The present invention also encompasses the use of these C-terminal LTRPC3k deletion polypeptides as immunogenic and\/or antigenic epitopes as described elsewhere herein.","Alternatively, preferred polypeptides of the present invention may comprise polypeptide sequences corresponding to, for example, internal regions of the LTRPC3k polypeptide (e.g., any combination of both N- and C-terminal LTRPC3k polypeptide deletions) of SEQ ID NO:10. For example, internal regions could be defined by the equation: amino acid NX to amino acid CX, wherein NX refers to any N-terminal deletion polypeptide amino acid of LTRPC3k (SEQ ID NO:10), and where CX refers to any C-terminal deletion polypeptide amino acid of LTRPC3k (SEQ ID NO:10). Polynucleotides encoding these polypeptides are also provided. The present invention also encompasses the use of these polypeptides as an immunogenic and\/or antigenic epitope as described elsewhere herein.","Many polynucleotide sequences, such as EST sequences, are publicly available and accessible through sequence databases. Some of these sequences are related to SEQ ID NO:9 and may have been publicly available prior to conception of the present invention. Preferably, such related polynucleotides are specifically excluded from the scope of the present invention. To list every related sequence would be cumbersome. Accordingly, preferably excluded from the present invention are one or more polynucleotides consisting of a nucleotide sequence described by the general formula of a-b, where a is any integer between 1 to 5193 of SEQ ID NO:9, b is an integer between 15 to 5207, where both a and b correspond to the positions of nucleotide residues shown in SEQ ID NO:9, and where b is greater than or equal to a+14.","The polypeptide of this gene provided as SEQ ID NO:12 (), encoded by the polynucleotide sequence according to SEQ ID NO:11 (), and\/or encoded by the polynucleotide contained within the deposited clone, LTRPC3l, has significant homology at the nucleotide and amino acid level to the human melastatin 1 protein (Melastatin1; Genbank Accession No. gi|3243075; SEQ ID NO:13). An alignment of the LTRPC3l polypeptide with this protein is provided in .","The LTRPC3l polypeptide was determined to share 65.7% identity and 73.5% similarity with the human melastatin 1 protein (Melastatin1; Genbank Accession No. gi|3243075; SEQ ID NO:13) as shown in .","The LTRPC3l protein is believed to represent a member of a new class of protein kinases referred to as alpha kinases (Curr. Biol. 9 (2), R43-R45 (1999)). These kinases represent a novel type of signaling molecule comprising both a catalytic protein kinase domain, in addition to, an ion channel domain. This family is commonly referred to as the transient receptor potential channel (TRP) family. Melastatin1 defines a separate subfamily of TRP channels referred to as TRPM (melastatin1). TRPM family members are characteristic of their unusually long cytoplasmic tails at both ends of the channel domain and some of the family members contain an enzyme domain at the C-terminal region.","Specifically, the LTRPC3l (SEQ ID NO:12) polypeptide represents a novel variant of the LTRPC3f (U.S. Ser. No. 10\/210,152, filed Aug. 1, 2002; International Publication No. WO 03\/012063, published Feb. 13, 2003; SEQ ID NO:21) polypeptide. The LTRPC3l represents a novel member of the TRPM subfamily.","The melastatin1 protein is believed to be negatively associated with the incidence of melanoma based upon its inverse correlative expression in highly aggressive melanomas (Genomics 54 (1), 116-123 (1998)). Thus, overexpression of melastatin1 could represent a novel therapeutic in the treatment of melanoma and potentially other cancers.","Based upon the observed homology, the polypeptide of the present invention is expected to share at least some biological activity with other transient receptor potential channel family members, more specifically with the melastatin1 protein, in addition to, other transient receptor potential channel family members referenced elsewhere herein or otherwise known in the art, particularly LTRPC3f, and LTRPC3.","Most of the known transient receptor potential channel family members, possess one or more transmembrane domains. Likewise, the LTRPC3l polypeptide has been determined to comprise six transmembrane domains (TM1-TM6) as shown in . The transmembrane domains are located from about amino acid 800 to about amino acid 817 (TM1), from about amino acid 897 to about amino acid 914 (TM2), from about amino acid 970 to about amino acid 983 (TM3), from about amino acid 997 to about amino acid 1014 (TM4), from about amino acid 1031 to about amino acid 1048 (TM5), and\/or from about amino acid 1118 to about amino acid 1137 (TM6) of SEQ ID NO:12.

As such, LTRPC3 behaves in a manner similar to a tumor suppressor, in that loss results in increases in proliferation. While some increases in the proliferation markers p21 and IkB were also observed, they were less significant, and could be a response to the pro-proliferative effect of LTRPC3 antisense inhibition. Interestingly, expression of LTRPC3 was also observed to be significantly reduced in tumor tissues, relative to normal tissues (see ). Specifically, renal, testicular, and ovarian tumor samples showed as much as 12 to 30 fold down regulation of LTRPC3 message levels compared to normal tissues. This reduction of LTRPC3 correlating with the tumor state is consistent with the negative FEN1 modulatory activity and suggests this gene may have antiproliferative activities. Therefore, for modulators of LTRPC3l to be useful for treating cancer, it would be necessary to increase the activity of the gene or gene product in order to have the reverse effect on cancerous cells.

Representative uses are described in the \u201cRegeneration\u201d and \u201cHyperproliferative Disorders\u201d sections below, in the Examples, and elsewhere herein.

The testes are also a site of active gene expression of transcripts that is expressed, particularly at low levels, in other tissues of the body. Therefore, this gene product may be expressed in other specific tissues or organs where it may play related functional roles in other processes, such as hematopoiesis, inflammation, bone formation, and kidney function, to name a few possible target indications.","Several known TRP family members have been identified that are expressed significantly in testis tissue.

Moreover, transient receptor potential channel family members have been implicated in disorders of the skin, skeletal-muscle, nervous, cardiac, and vascular systems, in addition to the following, non-limiting diseases and disorders, which include, for example, arteriosclerosis, neointimal hypoerplasia, metastatic melanomas, bipolar disorder, nonsyndromic hereditary deafness, Knobloch syndrome, holosencephaly, and various maligancies including prostate cancer.","In preferred embodiments, LTRPC3l polynucleotides and polypeptides of the present invention, including agonists and\/or fragments thereof, have uses that include, modulating cell proliferation, differentiation, migration, activation, exocytosis, muscle contraction, gene expression, apoptosis. signalling, pheromone sensory signaling, smooth muscle tone, pain perception, heat perception, osmosenstivity, and mechanosensitivity.","In more preferred embodiments, LTRPC3l polynucleotides and polypeptides of the present invention, including agonists and\/or fragments thereof, have uses that include, treating, ameliorating, preventing, detecting, and\/or prognosing various diseases and disorders, particularly the following, non-limiting examples, disorders of the skin, skeletal-muscle, nervous, cardiac, and vascular systems, in addition to the following, non-limiting diseases and disorders, which include, for example, arteriosclerosis, neointimal hypoerplasia, metastatic melanomas, bipolar disorder, nonsyndromic hereditary deafness, Knobloch syndrome, holosencephaly, and various maligancies including prostate cancer.","LTRPC3l polynucleotides and polypeptides of the present invention, including agonists and\/or fragments may be involved in intracellular Ca homeostasis which affects various aspects of biological functions including mechano-regulation, pain transduction, vasorelaxation, gene expression, cell cycle and proliferation\/apoptosis. Since the LTRPC3 variant is dominantly expressed in kidney, the LTRPC3l polypeptide may particularly play an important role in regulating cytosolic Ca2+ in the renal system, potentially Ca2+ absorption.","The LTRPC3l gene maps to chromosome 9q21.11-21.31 between the two markers D9S1874 and D9S1807. This region is linked to amyotrophic lateral sclerosis with frontotemporal dementia, early-onset pulverulent cataract, infantile nephronophthisis, hypomagnesemia with secondary hypocalcemia (HSH), and familial hemophagocytic lymphohistiocytosis. Therefore, agonists and\/or antagonists of the novel LTRPC3l can be used to treat diseases including various forms of neuronal degeneration, neurogenic inflammation, allergy, immunodeficiency\/excessive immune activation, visual defects, hearing disorder, pain, cancer, hypertension and other cardiovascular diseases. In addition, the therapeutics may be useful in the treatment of diseases associated with disturbances in Ca homeostasis including osteoporosis, hypercalciuric stone disease, and chronic renal failure.","Moreover, given the selective expression in kidney, LTRPC3l could be considered a candidate gene for HSH, since the phenotype is a renal insufficiency. LTRPC3l chromosomal location is \u02dc600 kb downstream of a X;9 translocation breakpoint interval described for one patient with HSH (6, 1491-1497, (1997)). Recently, two groups reported that a new member of the TRPM subfamily, TRPM6, expressed in both intestinal tissues and kidney, is associated with HSH (31, 166-170, (2002); and 31, 171-174 (2002)). Indeed, LTRPC3l is \u02dc4 mb 5\u2032 to TRPM6 on 9q21. Although TRPM6 is the first component identified for HSH, this should not preclude involvement of LTRPC3l in the disease. Therefore, it is possible that LTRPC3l may co-localize with TRPM6 and\/or forms a heteromultimer with TRPM6 in the kidney.","The kidney plays a major role in Ca homeostasis (reviewed in 75, 429-471, (1995)). LTRPC3l may play a direct role in Ca absorption due to its constitutive Ca permeability. Alternatively, LTRPC3l may be the SOC that regulates Ca absorption. In kidney, Ca absorption is regulated by agonists such as calcitonin, parathyroid hormone and parathyroid hormone-related peptide through their respective G protein-coupled receptors, and downstream SOCs. Additionally, in kidney a SOC has been described (276, 25759-25765, (2001)) for the action of angiotensin II, a vasoactive peptide that plays a major role in regulating blood pressure.","In addition, LTRPC3l polynucleotides and polypeptides of the present invention, including agonists and\/or fragments thereof, have uses that include modulating intracellular Ca++ ion concentrations, Ca++ ion flux, stored intracellular Ca++ ion concentrations, Ca++ ion pump activity, Ca++ ion flow into cell, Ca++ ion flow out of cells, the activation of Ca++ sensitive proteins, the activation of Ca++ sensitive signaling pathways, the activation of kinase-activatible proteins, and the activation of kinase-dependent signaling pathways.","The LTRPC3l polynucleotides and polypeptides of the present invention, including agonists and\/or fragments thereof, have uses that include modulating proliferation, differentiation, migration, and activation in various cells, tissues, and organisms, and particularly in mammalian kidney, spinal cord, testis, and brain, preferably human. LTRPC3l polynucleotides and polypeptides of the present invention, including agonists and\/or fragments thereof, may be useful in diagnosing, treating, prognosing, and\/or preventing renal, neural, and\/or proliferative diseases or disorders, particularly of the renal system.","In addition, antagonists of the LTRPC3l polynucleotides and polypeptides, including modulators or fragments thereof, may have uses that include diagnosing, treating, prognosing, and\/or preventing diseases or disorders related to transient receptor potential channel activity, which may include renal, neural, reproductive, and\/or proliferative diseases or disorders.","Although it is believed the encoded polypeptide may share at least some biological activities with transient receptor potential channel family members, particularly those melastatin1, a number of methods of determining the exact biological function of this clone are either known in the art or are described elsewhere herein. Briefly, the function of this clone may be determined by applying microarray methodology. Nucleic acids corresponding to the LTRPC3l polynucleotides, in addition to, other clones of the present invention, may be arrayed on microchips for expression profiling. Depending on which polynucleotide probe is used to hybridize to the slides, a change in expression of a specific gene may provide additional insight into the function of this gene based upon the conditions being studied. For example, an observed increase or decrease in expression levels when the polynucleotide probe used comes from tissue that has been treated with known transient potential receptor inhibitors, which include, but are not limited to the drugs listed herein or otherwise known in the art, might indicate a function in modulating transient potential receptor function, for example. In the case of LTRPC3l, kidney, spinal cord, testis, and brain, should be used to extract RNA to prepare the probe.","In addition, the function of the protein may be assessed by applying quantitative PCR methodology, for example. Real time quantitative PCR would provide the capability of following the expression of the LTRPC3l gene throughout development, for example. Quantitative PCR methodology requires only a nominal amount of tissue from each developmentally important step is needed to perform such experiments. Therefore, the application of quantitative PCR methodology to refining the biological function of this polypeptide is encompassed by the present invention. Also encompassed by the present invention are quantitative PCR probes corresponding to the polynucleotide sequence provided as SEQ ID NO:1 ().","The function of the protein may also be assessed through complementation assays in yeast. For example, in the case of the LTRPC3l, transforming yeast deficient in transient receptor potential channel activity with LTRPC3l and assessing their ability to grow would provide convincing evidence the LTRPC3l polypeptide has transient receptor potential channel activity. Additional assay conditions and methods that may be used in assessing the function of the polynucletides and polypeptides of the present invention are known in the art, some of which are disclosed elsewhere herein.","Alternatively, the biological function of the encoded polypeptide may be determined by disrupting a homologue of this polypeptide in Mice and\/or rats and observing the resulting phenotype.","Moreover, the biological function of this polypeptide may be determined by the application of antisense and\/or sense methodology and the resulting generation of transgenic mice and\/or rats. Expressing a particular gene in either sense or antisense orientation in a transgenic mouse or rat could lead to respectively higher or lower expression levels of that particular gene. Altering the endogenous expression levels of a gene can lead to the observation of a particular phenotype that can then be used to derive indications on the function of the gene. The gene can be either over-expressed or under expressed in every cell of the organism at all times using a strong ubiquitous promoter, or it could be expressed in one or more discrete parts of the organism using a well characterized tissue-specific promoter (e.g., a kidney, spinal cord, testis, and\/or brain-specific promoter), or it can be expressed at a specified time of development using an inducible and\/or a developmentally regulated promoter.","In the case of LTRPC3l transgenic mice or rats, if no phenotype is apparent in normal growth conditions, observing the organism under diseased conditions (renal, reproductive, neural, or proliferative disorders, etc.) may lead to understanding the function of the gene. Therefore, the application of antisense and\/or sense methodology to the creation of transgenic mice or rats to refine the biological function of the polypeptide is encompassed by the present invention.","In preferred embodiments, the following N-terminal LTRPC3l deletion polypeptides are encompassed by the present invention: M1-T1734, G2-T1734, K3-T1734, K4-T1734, W5-T1734, R6-T1734, D7-T1734, A8-T1734, A9-T1734, E10-T1734, M11-T1734, E12-T1734, R13-T1734, G14-T1734, C15-T1734, S16-T1734, D17-T1734, R18-T1734, E19-T1734, D20-T1734, N21-T1734, A22-T1734, E23-T1734, S24-T1734, R25-T1734, R26-T1734, R27-T1734, S28-T1734, R29-T1734, S30-T1734, A31-T1734, S32-T1734, R33-T1734, G34-T1734, R35-T1734, F36-T1734, A37-T1734, E38-T1734, S39-T1734, W40-T1734, K41-T1734, R42-T1734, L43-T1734, S44-T1734, S45-T1734, K46-T1734, Q47-T1734, G48-T1734, S49-T1734, T50-T1734, K51-T1734, R52-T1734, S53-T1734, G54-T1734, L55-T1734, P56-T1734, S57-T1734, Q58-T1734, Q59-T1734, T60-T1734, P61-T1734, A62-T1734, Q63-T1734, K64-T1734, S65-T1734, W66-T1734, 167-T1734, E68-T1734, R69-T1734, A70-T1734, F71-T1734, Y72-T1734, K73-T1734, R74-T1734, E75-T1734, C76-T1734, V77-T1734, H78-T1734, I79-T1734, I80-T1734, P81-T1734, S82-T1734, T83-T1734, K84-T1734, D85-T1734, P86-T1734, H87-T1734, R88-T1734, C89-T1734, C90-T1734, C91-T1734, G92-T1734, R93-T1734, L94-T1734, I95-T1734, G96-T1734, Q97-T1734, H98-T1734, V99-T1734, G100-T1734, L101-T1734, T102-T1734, P103-T1734, S104-T1734, I105-T1734, S106-T1734, V107-T1734, L108-T1734, Q109-T1734, N110-T1734, E111-T1734, K112-T1734, N113-T1734, E114-T1734, S115-T1734, R116-T1734, L117-T1734, S118-T1734, R119-T1734, N120-T1734, D121-T1734, I122-T1734, Q123-T1734, S124-T1734, E125-T1734, K126-T1734, W127-T1734, S128-T1734, I129-T1734, S130-T1734, K131-T1734, H132-T1734, T133-T1734, Q134-T1734, L135-T1734, S136-T1734, P137-T1734, T138-T1734, D139-T1734, A140-T1734, F141-T1734, G142-T1734, T143-T1734, I144-T1734, E145-T1734, F146-T1734, Q147-T1734, G148-T1734, G149-T1734, G150-T1734, H151-T1734, S152-T1734, N153-T1734, K154-T1734, and\/or A155-T1734 of SEQ ID NO:12.

The overlapping sequences were assembled into a single contiguous sequence of high redundancy (usually several overlapping sequences at each nucleotide position), resulting in a final sequence identified as SEQ ID NO:X.","The cDNA Clone ID was deposited on the date and given the corresponding deposit number listed in \u201cATCC Deposit No:Z and Date.\u201d \u201cVector\u201d refers to the type of vector contained in the cDNA Clone ID.","\u201cTotal NT Seq. Of Clone\u201d refers to the total number of nucleotides in the clone contig identified by \u201cGene No.\u201d The deposited clone may contain all or most of the sequence of SEQ ID NO:X. The nucleotide position of SEQ ID NO:X of the putative start codon (methionine) is identified as \u201c5\u2032 NT of Start Codon of ORF.\u201d","The translated amino acid sequence, beginning with the methionine, is identified as \u201cAA SEQ ID NO:Y,\u201d although other reading frames can also be easily translated using known molecular biology techniques. The polypeptides produced by these alternative open reading frames are specifically contemplated by the present invention.","The total number of amino acids within the open reading frame of SEQ ID NO:Y is identified as \u201cTotal AA of ORF\u201d.","SEQ ID NO:X (where X may be any of the polynucleotide sequences disclosed in the sequence listing) and the translated SEQ ID NO:Y (where Y may be any of the polypeptide sequences disclosed in the sequence listing) are sufficiently accurate and otherwise suitable for a variety of uses well known in the art and described further herein. For instance, SEQ ID NO:X is useful for designing nucleic acid hybridization probes that will detect nucleic acid sequences contained in SEQ ID NO:X or the cDNA contained in the deposited clone. These probes will also hybridize to nucleic acid molecules in biological samples, thereby enabling a variety of forensic and diagnostic methods of the invention.

The errors exist as misidentified nucleotides, or as insertions or deletions of nucleotides in the generated DNA sequence. The erroneously inserted or deleted nucleotides may cause frame shifts in the reading frames of the predicted amino acid sequence. In these cases, the predicted amino acid sequence diverges from the actual amino acid sequence, even though the generated DNA sequence may be greater than 99.9% identical to the actual DNA sequence (for example, one base insertion or deletion in an open reading frame of over 1000 bases).","Accordingly, for those applications requiring precision in the nucleotide sequence or the amino acid sequence, the present invention provides not only the generated nucleotide sequence identified as SEQ ID NO:1, 3, 5, 7, 9 and\/or 11 and the predicted translated amino acid sequence identified as SEQ ID NO:2, 4, 6, 8, 10 and\/or 12, but also a sample of plasmid DNA containing a cDNA of the invention deposited with the ATCC, as set forth in Table 1. The nucleotide sequence of each deposited clone can readily be determined by sequencing the deposited clone in accordance with known methods. The predicted amino acid sequence can then be verified from such deposits. Moreover, the amino acid sequence of the protein encoded by a particular clone can also be directly determined by peptide sequencing or by expressing the protein in a suitable host cell containing the deposited cDNA, collecting the protein, and determining its sequence.","The present invention also relates to the genes corresponding to SEQ ID NO:1, 3, 5, 7, 9 and\/or 11, SEQ ID NO:2, 4, 6, 8, 10 and\/or 12, or the deposited clone.

In other words, to obtain a nucleic acid having a nucleotide sequence at least 95% identical to a reference nucleotide sequence, up to 5% of the nucleotides in the reference sequence may be deleted or substituted with another nucleotide, or a number of nucleotides up to 5% of the total nucleotides in the reference sequence may be inserted into the reference sequence. The query sequence may be an entire sequence referenced in Table 1, the ORF (open reading frame), or any fragment specified as described herein.","As a practical matter, whether any particular nucleic acid molecule or polypeptide is at least about 80%, 85%, 90%, 91%, 92%, 93%, 94%, 95%, 96%, 97%, 98%, 99%, 99.1%, 99.2%, 99.3%, 99.4%, 99.5%, 99.6%, 99.7%, 99.8%, or 99.9% identical to a nucleotide sequence of the present invention can be determined conventionally using known computer programs. A preferred method for determining the best overall match between a query sequence (a sequence of the present invention) and a subject sequence, also referred to as a global sequence alignment, can be determined using the CLUSTALW computer program (Thompson, J. D., et al., Nucleic Acids Research, 2(22):4673-4680, (1994)), which is based on the algorithm of Higgins, D. G., et al., Computer Applications in the Biosciences (CABIOS), 8(2):189-191, (1992). In a sequence alignment the query and subject sequences are both DNA sequences. An RNA sequence can be compared by converting U's to T's. However, the CLUSTALW algorithm automatically converts U's to T's when comparing RNA sequences to DNA sequences. The result of said global sequence alignment is in percent identity. Preferred parameters used in a CLUSTALW alignment of DNA sequences to calculate percent identity via pairwise alignments are: Matrix=IUB, k-tuple=1, Number of Top Diagonals=5, Gap Penalty=3, Gap Open Penalty 10, Gap Extension Penalty=0.1, Scoring Method=Percent, Window Size=5 or the length of the subject nucleotide sequence, whichever is shorter. For multiple alignments, the following CLUSTALW parameters are preferred: Gap Opening Penalty=10; Gap Extension Parameter=0.05; Gap Separation Penalty Range=8; End Gap Separation Penalty=Off; % Identity for Alignment Delay=40%; Residue Specific Gaps:Off; Hydrophilic Residue Gap=Off; and Transition Weighting=0. The pairwise and multiple alignment parameters provided for CLUSTALW above represent the default parameters as provided with the AlignX software program (Vector NTI suite of programs, version 6.0).","The present invention encompasses the application of a manual correction to the percent identity results, in the instance where the subject sequence is shorter than the query sequence because of 5\u2032 or 3\u2032 deletions, not because of internal deletions. If only the local pairwise percent identity is required, no manual correction is needed. However, a manual correction may be applied to determine the global percent identity from a global polynucleotide alignment. Percent identity calculations based upon global polynucleotide alignments are often preferred since they reflect the percent identity between the polynucleotide molecules as a whole (i.e., including any polynucleotide overhangs, not just overlapping regions), as opposed to, only local matching polynucleotides. Manual corrections for global percent identity determinations are required since the CLUSTALW program does not account for 5\u2032 and 3\u2032 truncations of the subject sequence when calculating percent identity. For subject sequences truncated at the 5\u2032 or 3\u2032 ends, relative to the query sequence, the percent identity is corrected by calculating the number of bases of the query sequence that are 5\u2032 and 3\u2032 of the subject sequence, which are not matched\/aligned, as a percent of the total bases of the query sequence. Whether a nucleotide is matched\/aligned is determined by results of the CLUSTALW sequence alignment. This percentage is then subtracted from the percent identity, calculated by the above CLUSTALW program using the specified parameters, to arrive at a final percent identity score. This corrected score may be used for the purposes of the present invention. Only bases outside the 5\u2032 and 3\u2032 bases of the subject sequence, as displayed by the CLUSTALW alignment, which are not matched\/aligned with the query sequence, are calculated for the purposes of manually adjusting the percent identity score.","For example, a 90 base subject sequence is aligned to a 100 base query sequence to determine percent identity. The deletions occur at the 5\u2032 end of the subject sequence and therefore, the CLUSTALW alignment does not show a matched\/alignment of the first 10 bases at 5\u2032 end. The 10 unpaired bases represent 10% of the sequence (number of bases at the 5\u2032 and 3\u2032 ends not matched\/total number of bases in the query sequence) so 10% is subtracted from the percent identity score calculated by the CLUSTALW program. If the remaining 90 bases were perfectly matched the final percent identity would be 90%. In another example, a 90 base subject sequence is compared with a 100 base query sequence. This time the deletions are internal deletions so that there are no bases on the 5\u2032 or 3\u2032 of the subject sequence which are not matched\/aligned with the query. In this case the percent identity calculated by CLUSTALW is not manually corrected. Once again, only bases 5\u2032 and 3\u2032 of the subject sequence which are not matched\/aligned with the query sequence are manually corrected for. No other manual corrections are required for the purposes of the present invention.","By a polypeptide having an amino acid sequence at least, for example, 95% \u201cidentical\u201d to a query amino acid sequence of the present invention, it is intended that the amino acid sequence of the subject polypeptide is identical to the query sequence except that the subject polypeptide sequence may include up to five amino acid alterations per each 100 amino acids of the query amino acid sequence. In other words, to obtain a polypeptide having an amino acid sequence at least 95% identical to a query amino acid sequence, up to 5% of the amino acid residues in the subject sequence may be inserted, deleted, or substituted with another amino acid. These alterations of the reference sequence may occur at the amino- or carboxy-terminal positions of the reference amino acid sequence or anywhere between those terminal positions, interspersed either individually among residues in the reference sequence or in one or more contiguous groups within the reference sequence.","As a practical matter, whether any particular polypeptide is at least about 80%, 85%, 90%, 91%, 92%, 93%, 94%, 95%, 96%, 97%, 98%, 99%, 99.1%, 99.2%, 99.3%, 99.4%, 99.5%, 99.6%, 99.7%, 99.8%, or 99.9% identical to, for instance, an amino acid sequence referenced in Table 1 (SEQ ID NO:2) or to the amino acid sequence encoded by cDNA contained in a deposited clone, can be determined conventionally using known computer programs. A preferred method for determining the best overall match between a query sequence (a sequence of the present invention) and a subject sequence, also referred to as a global sequence alignment, can be determined using the CLUSTALW computer program (Thompson, J. D., et al., Nucleic Acids Research, 2(22):4673-4680, (1994)), which is based on the algorithm of Higgins, D. G., et al., Computer Applications in the Biosciences (CABIOS), 8(2):189-191, (1992). In a sequence alignment the query and subject sequences are both amino acid sequences. The result of said global sequence alignment is in percent identity. Preferred parameters used in a CLUSTALW alignment of DNA sequences to calculate percent identity via pairwise alignments are: Matrix=BLOSUM, k-tuple=1, Number of Top Diagonals=5, Gap Penalty=3, Gap Open Penalty 10, Gap Extension Penalty=0.1, Scoring Method=Percent, Window Size=5 or the length of the subject nucleotide sequence, whichever is shorter. For multiple alignments, the following CLUSTALW parameters are preferred: Gap Opening Penalty=10; Gap Extension Parameter=0.05; Gap Separation Penalty Range=8; End Gap Separation Penalty=Off; % Identity for Alignment Delay=40%; Residue Specific Gaps:Off; Hydrophilic Residue Gap=Off; and Transition Weighting=0. The pairwise and multiple alignment parameters provided for CLUSTALW above represent the default parameters as provided with the AlignX software program (Vector NTI suite of programs, version 6.0).","The present invention encompasses the application of a manual correction to the percent identity results, in the instance where the subject sequence is shorter than the query sequence because of N- or C-terminal deletions, not because of internal deletions. If only the local pairwise percent identity is required, no manual correction is needed. However, a manual correction may be applied to determine the global percent identity from a global polypeptide alignment. Percent identity calculations based upon global polypeptide alignments are often preferred since they reflect the percent identity between the polypeptide molecules as a whole (i.e., including any polypeptide overhangs, not just overlapping regions), as opposed to, only local matching polypeptides. Manual corrections for global percent identity determinations are required since the CLUSTALW program does not account for N- and C-terminal truncations of the subject sequence when calculating percent identity. For subject sequences truncated at the N- and C-termini, relative to the query sequence, the percent identity is corrected by calculating the number of residues of the query sequence that are N- and C-terminal of the subject sequence, which are not matched\/aligned with a corresponding subject residue, as a percent of the total bases of the query sequence. Whether a residue is matched\/aligned is determined by results of the CLUSTALW sequence alignment. This percentage is then subtracted from the percent identity, calculated by the above CLUSTALW program using the specified parameters, to arrive at a final percent identity score. This final percent identity score is what may be used for the purposes of the present invention. Only residues to the N- and C-termini of the subject sequence, which are not matched\/aligned with the query sequence, are considered for the purposes of manually adjusting the percent identity score. That is, only query residue positions outside the farthest N- and C-terminal residues of the subject sequence.","For example, a 90 amino acid residue subject sequence is aligned with a 100 residue query sequence to determine percent identity. The deletion occurs at the N-terminus of the subject sequence and therefore, the CLUSTALW alignment does not show a matching\/alignment of the first 10 residues at the N-terminus. The 10 unpaired residues represent 10% of the sequence (number of residues at the N- and C-termini not matched\/total number of residues in the query sequence) so 10% is subtracted from the percent identity score calculated by the CLUSTALW program. If the remaining 90 residues were perfectly matched the final percent identity would be 90%. In another example, a 90 residue subject sequence is compared with a 100 residue query sequence. This time the deletions are internal deletions so there are no residues at the N- or C-termini of the subject sequence, which are not matched\/aligned with the query. In this case the percent identity calculated by CLUSTALW is not manually corrected. Once again, only residue positions outside the N- and C-terminal ends of the subject sequence, as displayed in the CLUSTALW alignment, which are not matched\/aligned with the query sequence are manually corrected for. No other manual corrections are required for the purposes of the present invention.","In addition to the above method of aligning two or more polynucleotide or polypeptide sequences to arrive at a percent identity value for the aligned sequences, it may be desirable in some circumstances to use a modified version of the CLUSTALW algorithm which takes into account known structural features of the sequences to be aligned, such as for example, the SWISS-PROT designations for each sequence. The result of such a modified CLUSTALW algorithm may provide a more accurate value of the percent identity for two polynucleotide or polypeptide sequences. Support for such a modified version of CLUSTALW is provided within the CLUSTALW algorithm and would be readily appreciated to one of skill in the art of bioinformatics.","The variants may contain alterations in the coding regions, non-coding regions, or both. Especially preferred are polynucleotide variants containing alterations which produce silent substitutions, additions, or deletions, but do not alter the properties or activities of the encoded polypeptide. Nucleotide variants produced by silent substitutions due to the degeneracy of the genetic code are preferred. Moreover, variants in which 5-10, 1-5, or 1-2 amino acids are substituted, deleted, or added in any combination are also preferred. Polynucleotide variants can be produced for a variety of reasons, e.g., to optimize codon expression for a particular host (change codons in the mRNA to those preferred by a bacterial host such as ).","Naturally occurring variants are called \u201callelic variants,\u201d and refer to one of several alternate forms of a gene occupying a given locus on a chromosome of an organism. (Genes II, Lewin, B., ed., John Wiley & Sons, New York (1985).) These allelic variants can vary at either the polynucleotide and\/or polypeptide level and are included in the present invention. Alternatively, non-naturally occurring variants may be produced by mutagenesis techniques or by direct synthesis.","Using known methods of protein engineering and recombinant DNA technology, variants may be generated to improve or alter the characteristics of the polypeptides of the present invention. For instance, one or more amino acids can be deleted from the N-terminus or C-terminus of the protein without substantial loss of biological function. The authors of Ron et al., J. Biol. Chem. . . . 268: 2984-2988 (1993), reported variant KGF proteins having heparin binding activity even after deleting 3, 8, or 27 amino-terminal amino acid residues. Similarly, Interferon gamma exhibited up to ten times higher activity after deleting 8-10 amino acid residues from the carboxy terminus of this protein (Dobeli et al., J. Biotechnology 7:199-216 (1988)).","Moreover, ample evidence demonstrates that variants often retain a biological activity similar to that of the naturally occurring protein. For example, Gayle and coworkers (J. Biol. Chem. 268:22105-22111 (1993)) conducted extensive mutational analysis of human cytokine IL-1a. They used random mutagenesis to generate over 3,500 individual IL-1a mutants that averaged 2.5 amino acid changes per variant over the entire length of the molecule. Multiple mutations were examined at every possible amino acid position. The investigators found that \u201c[m]ost of the molecule could be altered with little effect on either [binding or biological activity].\u201d In fact, only 23 unique amino acid sequences, out of more than 3,500 nucleotide sequences examined, produced a protein that significantly differed in activity from wild-type.","Furthermore, even if deleting one or more amino acids from the N-terminus or C-terminus of a polypeptide results in modification or loss of one or more biological functions, other biological activities may still be retained. For example, the ability of a deletion variant to induce and\/or to bind antibodies which recognize the protein will likely be retained when less than the majority of the residues of the protein are removed from the N-terminus or C-terminus. Whether a particular polypeptide lacking N- or C-terminal residues of a protein retains such immunogenic activities can readily be determined by routine methods described herein and otherwise known in the art.","Alternatively, such N-terminus or C-terminus deletions of a polypeptide of the present invention may, in fact, result in a significant increase in one or more of the biological activities of the polypeptide(s). For example, biological activity of many polypeptides are governed by the presence of regulatory domains at either one or both termini. Such regulatory domains effectively inhibit the biological activity of such polypeptides in lieu of an activation event (e.g., binding to a cognate ligand or receptor, phosphorylation, proteolytic processing, etc.). Thus, by eliminating the regulatory domain of a polypeptide, the polypeptide may effectively be rendered biologically active in the absence of an activation event.","The invention further includes polypeptide variants that show substantial biological activity. Such variants include deletions, insertions, inversions, repeats, and substitutions selected according to general rules known in the art so as have little effect on activity. For example, guidance concerning how to make phenotypically silent amino acid substitutions is provided in Bowie et al., Science 247:1306-1310 (1990), wherein the authors indicate that there are two main strategies for studying the tolerance of an amino acid sequence to change.","The first strategy exploits the tolerance of amino acid substitutions by natural selection during the process of evolution. By comparing amino acid sequences in different species, conserved amino acids can be identified. These conserved amino acids are likely important for protein function. In contrast, the amino acid positions where substitutions have been tolerated by natural selection indicates that these positions are not critical for protein function. Thus, positions tolerating amino acid substitution could be modified while still maintaining biological activity of the protein.","The second strategy uses genetic engineering to introduce amino acid changes at specific positions of a cloned gene to identify regions critical for protein function. For example, site directed mutagenesis or alanine-scanning mutagenesis (introduction of single alanine mutations at every residue in the molecule) can be used. (Cunningham and Wells, Science 244:1081-1085 (1989).) The resulting mutant molecules can then be tested for biological activity.","As the authors state, these two strategies have revealed that proteins are surprisingly tolerant of amino acid substitutions. The authors further indicate which amino acid changes are likely to be permissive at certain amino acid positions in the protein. For example, most buried (within the tertiary structure of the protein) amino acid residues require nonpolar side chains, whereas few features of surface side chains are generally conserved.","The invention encompasses polypeptides having a lower degree of identity but having sufficient similarity so as to perform one or more of the same functions performed by the polypeptide of the present invention. Similarity is determined by conserved amino acid substitution. Such substitutions are those that substitute a given amino acid in a polypeptide by another amino acid of like characteristics (e.g., chemical properties). According to Cunningham et al above, such conservative substitutions are likely to be phenotypically silent. Additional guidance concerning which amino acid changes are likely to be phenotypically silent are found in Bowie et al., Science 247:1306-1310 (1990).","Tolerated conservative amino acid substitutions of the present invention involve replacement of the aliphatic or hydrophobic amino acids Ala, Val, Leu and Ile; replacement of the hydroxyl residues Ser and Thr; replacement of the acidic residues Asp and Glu; replacement of the amide residues Asn and Gln, replacement of the basic residues Lys, Arg, and His; replacement of the aromatic residues Phe, Tyr, and Trp, and replacement of the small-sized amino acids Ala, Ser, Thr, Met, and Gly.","In addition, the present invention also encompasses the conservative substitutions provided in Table III below.",{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0639","num":"0638"},"tables":{"@attributes":{"id":"TABLE-US-00003","num":"00003"},"table":{"@attributes":{"frame":"none","colsep":"0","rowsep":"0"},"tgroup":{"@attributes":{"align":"left","colsep":"0","rowsep":"0","cols":"3"},"colspec":[{"@attributes":{"colname":"1","colwidth":"49pt","align":"left"}},{"@attributes":{"colname":"2","colwidth":"21pt","align":"center"}},{"@attributes":{"colname":"3","colwidth":"147pt","align":"left"}}],"thead":{"row":[{"entry":"TABLE III"},{"entry":{"@attributes":{"namest":"1","nameend":"3","align":"center","rowsep":"1"}}},{"entry":["For",{},{}]},{"entry":["Amino Acid","Code","Replace with any of:"]},{"entry":{"@attributes":{"namest":"1","nameend":"3","align":"center","rowsep":"1"}}}]},"tbody":{"@attributes":{"valign":"top"},"row":[{"entry":["Alanine","A","D-Ala, Gly, beta-Ala, L-Cys, D-Cys"]},{"entry":["Arginine","R","D-Arg, Lys, D-Lys, homo-Arg, D-homo-Arg,"]},{"entry":[{},{},"Met, Ile, D-Met, D-Ile, Orn, D-Orn"]},{"entry":["Asparagine","N","D-Asn, Asp, D-Asp, Glu, D-Glu, Gln, D-Gln"]},{"entry":["Aspartic Acid","D","D-Asp, D-Asn, Asn, Glu, D-Glu, Gln, D-Gln"]},{"entry":["Cysteine","C","D-Cys, S\u2014Me-Cys, Met, D-Met, Thr, D-Thr"]},{"entry":["Glutamine","Q","D-Gln, Asn, D-Asn, Glu, D-Glu, Asp, D-Asp"]},{"entry":["Glutamic Acid","E","D-Glu, D-Asp, Asp, Asn, D-Asn, Gln, D-Gln"]},{"entry":["Glycine","G","Ala, D-Ala, Pro, D-Pro, \u03b2-Ala, Acp"]},{"entry":["Isoleucine","I","D-Ile, Val, D-Val, Leu, D-Leu, Met, D-Met"]},{"entry":["Leucine","L","D-Leu, Val, D-Val, Met, D-Met"]},{"entry":["Lysine","K","D-Lys, Arg, D-Arg, homo-Arg, D-homo-Arg,"]},{"entry":[{},{},"Met, D-Met, Ile, D-Ile, Orn, D-Orn"]},{"entry":["Methionine","M","D-Met, S\u2014Me-Cys, Ile, D-Ile, Leu, D-Leu,"]},{"entry":[{},{},"Val, D-Val"]},{"entry":["Phenylalanine","F","D-Phe, Tyr, D-Thr, L-Dopa, His, D-His, Trp,"]},{"entry":[{},{},"D-Trp, Trans-3,4, or 5-phenylproline, cis-3,4,"]},{"entry":[{},{},"or 5-phenylproline"]},{"entry":["Proline","P","D-Pro, L-1-thioazolidine-4-carboxylic acid, D- or"]},{"entry":[{},{},"L-1-oxazolidine-4-carboxylic acid"]},{"entry":["Serine","S","D-Ser, Thr, D-Thr, allo-Thr, Met, D-Met,"]},{"entry":[{},{},"Met(O), D-Met(O), L-Cys, D-Cys"]},{"entry":["Threonine","T","D-Thr, Ser, D-Ser, allo-Thr, Met, D-Met, Met(O),"]},{"entry":[{},{},"D-Met(O), Val, D-Val"]},{"entry":["Tyrosine","Y","D-Tyr, Phe, D-Phe, L-Dopa, His, D-His"]},{"entry":["Valine","V","D-Val, Leu, D-Leu, Ile, D-Ile, Met, D-Met"]},{"entry":{"@attributes":{"namest":"1","nameend":"3","align":"center","rowsep":"1"}}}]}}}}},"Aside from the uses described above, such amino acid substitutions may also increase protein or peptide stability.

W., ed., Academic Press, New York, 1993; Informatics Computer Analysis of Sequence Data, Part 1, Griffin, A. M., and Griffin, H. G., eds., Humana Press, New Jersey, 1994; Sequence Analysis in Molecular Biology, von Heinje, G., Academic Press, 1987; and Sequence Analysis Primer, Gribskov, M. and Devereux, J., eds., M Stockton Press, New York, 1991.","In addition, the present invention also encompasses substitution of amino acids based upon the probability of an amino acid substitution resulting in conservation of function. Such probabilities are determined by aligning multiple genes with related function and assessing the relative penalty of each substitution to proper gene function. Such probabilities are often described in a matrix and are used by some algorithms (e.g., BLAST, CLUSTALW, GAP, etc.) in calculating percent similarity wherein similarity refers to the degree by which one amino acid may substitute for another amino acid without lose of function. An example of such a matrix is the PAM250 or BLOSUM62 matrix.","Aside from the canonical chemically conservative substitutions referenced above, the invention also encompasses substitutions which are typically not classified as conservative, but that may be chemically conservative under certain circumstances. Analysis of enzymatic catalysis for proteases, for example, has shown that certain amino acids within the active site of some enzymes may have highly perturbed pKa's due to the unique microenvironment of the active site. Such perturbed pKa's could enable some amino acids to substitute for other amino acids while conserving enzymatic structure and function. Examples of amino acids that are known to have amino acids with perturbed pKa's are the Glu-35 residue of Lysozyme, the Ile-16 residue of Chymotrypsin, the His-159 residue of Papain, etc. The conservation of function relates to either anomalous protonation or anomalous deprotonation of such amino acids, relative to their canonical, non-perturbed pKa. The pKa perturbation may enable these amino acids to actively participate in general acid-base catalysis due to the unique ionization environment within the enzyme active site. Thus, substituting an amino acid capable of serving as either a general acid or general base within the microenvironment of an enzyme active site or cavity, as may be the case, in the same or similar capacity as the wild-type amino acid, would effectively serve as a conservative amino substitution.","Besides conservative amino acid substitution, variants of the present invention include, but are not limited to, the following: (i) substitutions with one or more of the non-conserved amino acid residues, where the substituted amino acid residues may or may not be one encoded by the genetic code, or (ii) substitution with one or more of amino acid residues having a substituent group, or (iii) fusion of the mature polypeptide with another compound, such as a compound to increase the stability and\/or solubility of the polypeptide (for example, polyethylene glycol), or (iv) fusion of the polypeptide with additional amino acids, such as, for example, an IgG Fc fusion region peptide, or leader or secretory sequence, or a sequence facilitating purification. Such variant polypeptides are deemed to be within the scope of those skilled in the art from the teachings herein.","For example, polypeptide variants containing amino acid substitutions of charged amino acids with other charged or neutral amino acids may produce proteins with improved characteristics, such as less aggregation. Aggregation of pharmaceutical formulations both reduces activity and increases clearance due to the aggregate's immunogenic activity. (Pinckard et al., Clin. Exp. Immunol. 2:331-340 (1967); Robbins et al., Diabetes 36: 838-845 (1987); Cleland et al., Crit. Rev. Therapeutic Drug Carrier Systems 10:307-377 (1993).)","Moreover, the invention further includes polypeptide variants created through the application of molecular evolution (\u201cDNA Shuffling\u201d) methodology to the polynucleotide disclosed as SEQ ID NO:1, 3, 5, 7, 9 and\/or 11, the sequence of the clone submitted in a deposit, and\/or the cDNA encoding the polypeptide disclosed as SEQ ID NO:2, 4, 6, 8, 10 and\/or 12. Such DNA Shuffling technology is known in the art and more particularly described elsewhere herein (e.g., WPC, Stemmer, PNAS, 91:10747, (1994)), and in the Examples provided herein).","A further embodiment of the invention relates to a polypeptide which comprises the amino acid sequence of the present invention having an amino acid sequence which contains at least one amino acid substitution, but not more than 50 amino acid substitutions, even more preferably, not more than 40 amino acid substitutions, still more preferably, not more than 30 amino acid substitutions, and still even more preferably, not more than 20 amino acid substitutions. Of course, in order of ever-increasing preference, it is highly preferable for a peptide or polypeptide to have an amino acid sequence which comprises the amino acid sequence of the present invention, which contains at least one, but not more than 10, 9, 8, 7, 6, 5, 4, 3, 2 or 1 amino acid substitutions. In specific embodiments, the number of additions, substitutions, and\/or deletions in the amino acid sequence of the present invention or fragments thereof (e.g., the mature form and\/or other fragments described herein), is 1-5, 5-10, 5-25, 5-50, 10-50 or 50-150, conservative amino acid substitutions are preferable.","The present invention is directed to polynucleotide fragments of the polynucleotides of the invention, in addition to polypeptides encoded therein by said polynucleotides and\/or fragments.","In the present invention, a \u201cpolynucleotide fragment\u201d refers to a short polynucleotide having a nucleic acid sequence which: is a portion of that contained in a deposited clone, or encoding the polypeptide encoded by the cDNA in a deposited clone; is a portion of that shown in SEQ ID NO:1, 3, 5, 7, 9 and\/or 11 or the complementary strand thereto, or is a portion of a polynucleotide sequence encoding the polypeptide of SEQ ID NO:2, 4, 6, 8, 10 and\/or 12.

In this context \u201cabout\u201d includes the particularly recited value, a value larger or smaller by several (5, 4, 3, 2, or 1) nucleotides, at either terminus, or at both termini. These nucleotide fragments have uses that include, but are not limited to, as diagnostic probes and primers as discussed herein. Of course, larger fragments (e.g., 50, 150, 500, 600, 2000 nucleotides) are preferred.","Moreover, representative examples of polynucleotide fragments of the invention, include, for example, fragments comprising, or alternatively consisting of, a sequence from about nucleotide number 1-50, 51-100, 101-150, 151-200, 201-250, 251-300, 301-350, 351-400, 401-450, 451-500, 501-550, 551-600, 651-700, 701-750, 751-800, 800-850, 851-900, 901-950, 951-1000, 1001-1050, 1051-1100, 1101-1150, 1151-1200, 1201-1250, 1251-1300, 1301-1350, 1351-1400, 1401-1450, 1451-1500, 1501-1550, 1551-1600, 1601-1650, 1651-1700, 1701-1750, 1751-1800, 1801-1850, 1851-1900, 1901-1950, 1951-2000, or 2001 to the end of SEQ ID NO:1, 3, 5, 7, 9 and\/or 11, or the complementary strand thereto, or the cDNA contained in a deposited clone. In this context \u201cabout\u201d includes the particularly recited ranges, and ranges larger or smaller by several (5, 4, 3, 2, or 1) nucleotides, at either terminus or at both termini. Preferably, these fragments encode a polypeptide which has biological activity. More preferably, these polynucleotides can be used as probes or primers as discussed herein. Also encompassed by the present invention are polynucleotides which hybridize to these nucleic acid molecules under stringent hybridization conditions or lower stringency conditions, as are the polypeptides encoded by these polynucleotides.","In the present invention, a \u201cpolypeptide fragment\u201d refers to an amino acid sequence which is a portion of that contained in SEQ ID NO:2, 4, 6, 8, 10 and\/or 12 or encoded by the cDNA contained in a deposited clone. Protein (polypeptide) fragments may be \u201cfree-standing,\u201d or comprised within a larger polypeptide of which the fragment forms a part or region, most preferably as a single continuous region. Representative examples of polypeptide fragments of the invention, include, for example, fragments comprising, or alternatively consisting of, from about amino acid number 1-20, 21-40, 41-60, 61-80, 81-100, 102-120, 121-140, 141-160, or 161 to the end of the coding region. Moreover, polypeptide fragments can be about 20, 30, 40, 50, 60, 70, 80, 90, 100, 110, 120, 130, 140, or 150 amino acids in length. In this context \u201cabout\u201d includes the particularly recited ranges or values, and ranges or values larger or smaller by several (5, 4, 3, 2, or 1) amino acids, at either extreme or at both extremes. Polynucleotides encoding these polypeptides are also encompassed by the invention.","Preferred polypeptide fragments include the full-length protein. Further preferred polypeptide fragments include the full-length protein having a continuous series of deleted residues from the amino or the carboxy terminus, or both. For example, any number of amino acids, ranging from 1-60, can be deleted from the amino terminus of the full-length polypeptide. Similarly, any number of amino acids, ranging from 1-30, can be deleted from the carboxy terminus of the full-length protein. Furthermore, any combination of the above amino and carboxy terminus deletions are preferred. Similarly, polynucleotides encoding these polypeptide fragments are also preferred.","Also preferred are polypeptide and polynucleotide fragments characterized by structural or functional domains, such as fragments that comprise alpha-helix and alpha-helix forming regions, beta-sheet and beta-sheet-forming regions, turn and turn-forming regions, coil and coil-forming regions, hydrophilic regions, hydrophobic regions, alpha amphipathic regions, beta amphipathic regions, flexible regions, surface-forming regions, substrate binding region, and high antigenic index regions. Polypeptide fragments of SEQ ID NO:2, 4, 6, 8, 10 and\/or 12 falling within conserved domains are specifically contemplated by the present invention. Moreover, polynucleotides encoding these domains are also contemplated.","Other preferred polypeptide fragments are biologically active fragments. Biologically active fragments are those exhibiting activity similar, but not necessarily identical, to an activity of the polypeptide of the present invention. The biological activity of the fragments may include an improved desired activity, or a decreased undesirable activity. Polynucleotides encoding these polypeptide fragments are also encompassed by the invention.","In a preferred embodiment, the functional activity displayed by a polypeptide encoded by a polynucleotide fragment of the invention may be one or more biological activities typically associated with the full-length polypeptide of the invention. Illustrative of these biological activities includes the fragments ability to bind to at least one of the same antibodies which bind to the full-length protein, the fragments ability to interact with at least one of the same proteins which bind to the full-length, the fragments ability to elicit at least one of the same immune responses as the full-length protein (i.e., to cause the immune system to create antibodies specific to the same epitope, etc.), the fragments ability to bind to at least one of the same polynucleotides as the full-length protein, the fragments ability to bind to a receptor of the full-length protein, the fragments ability to bind to a ligand of the full-length protein, and the fragments ability to multimerize with the full-length protein. However, the skilled artisan would appreciate that some fragments may have biological activities which are desirable and directly inapposite to the biological activity of the full-length protein. The functional activity of polypeptides of the invention, including fragments, variants, derivatives, and analogs thereof can be determined by numerous methods available to the skilled artisan, some of which are described elsewhere herein.","The present invention encompasses polypeptides comprising, or alternatively consisting of, an epitope of the polypeptide having an amino acid sequence of SEQ ID NO:2, 4, 6, 8, 10 and\/or 12, or an epitope of the polypeptide sequence encoded by a polynucleotide sequence contained in ATCC deposit No. Z or encoded by a polynucleotide that hybridizes to the complement of the sequence of SEQ ID NO:1, 3, 5, 7, 9 and\/or 11 or contained in ATCC deposit No. Z under stringent hybridization conditions or lower stringency hybridization conditions as defined supra. The present invention further encompasses polynucleotide sequences encoding an epitope of a polypeptide sequence of the invention (such as, for example, the sequence disclosed in SEQ ID NO:1), polynucleotide sequences of the complementary strand of a polynucleotide sequence encoding an epitope of the invention, and polynucleotide sequences which hybridize to the complementary strand under stringent hybridization conditions or lower stringency hybridization conditions defined supra.","The term \u201cepitopes,\u201d as used herein, refers to portions of a polypeptide having antigenic or immunogenic activity in an animal, preferably a mammal, and most preferably in a human. In a preferred embodiment, the present invention encompasses a polypeptide comprising an epitope, as well as the polynucleotide encoding this polypeptide. An \u201cimmunogenic epitope,\u201d as used herein, is defined as a portion of a protein that elicits an antibody response in an animal, as determined by any method known in the art, for example, by the methods for generating antibodies described infra. (See, for example, Geysen et al., Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. USA 81:3998-4002 (1983)). The term \u201cantigenic epitope,\u201d as used herein, is defined as a portion of a protein to which an antibody can immunospecifically bind its antigen as determined by any method well known in the art, for example, by the immunoassays described herein. Immunospecific binding excludes non-specific binding but does not necessarily exclude cross-reactivity with other antigens. Antigenic epitopes need not necessarily be immunogenic.","Fragments which function as epitopes may be produced by any conventional means. (See, e.g., Houghten, Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. USA 82:5131-5135 (1985), further described in U.S. Pat. No. 4,631,211).","In the present invention, antigenic epitopes preferably contain a sequence of at least 4, at least 5, at least 6, at least 7, more preferably at least 8, at least 9, at least 10, at least 11, at least 12, at least 13, at least 14, at least 15, at least 20, at least 25, at least 30, at least 40, at least 50, and, most preferably, between about 15 to about 30 amino acids. Preferred polypeptides comprising immunogenic or antigenic epitopes are at least 10, 15, 20, 25, 30, 35, 40, 45, 50, 55, 60, 65, 70, 75, 80, 85, 90, 95, or 100 amino acid residues in length, or longer. Additional non-exclusive preferred antigenic epitopes include the antigenic epitopes disclosed herein, as well as portions thereof. Antigenic epitopes are useful, for example, to raise antibodies, including monoclonal antibodies, that specifically bind the epitope. Preferred antigenic epitopes include the antigenic epitopes disclosed herein, as well as any combination of two, three, four, five or more of these antigenic epitopes. Antigenic epitopes can be used as the target molecules in immunoassays. (See, for instance, Wilson et al., Cell 37:767-778 (1984); Sutcliffe et al., Science 219:660-666 (1983)).","Similarly, immunogenic epitopes can be used, for example, to induce antibodies according to methods well known in the art. (See, for instance, Sutcliffe et al., supra; Wilson et al., supra; Chow et al., Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. USA 82:910-914; and Bittle et al., J. Gen. Virol. 66:2347-2354 (1985). Preferred immunogenic epitopes include the immunogenic epitopes disclosed herein, as well as any combination of two, three, four, five or more of these immunogenic epitopes. The polypeptides comprising one or more immunogenic epitopes may be presented for eliciting an antibody response together with a carrier protein, such as an albumin, to an animal system (such as rabbit or mouse), or, if the polypeptide is of sufficient length (at least about 25 amino acids), the polypeptide may be presented without a carrier. However, immunogenic epitopes comprising as few as 8 to 10 amino acids have been shown to be sufficient to raise antibodies capable of binding to, at the very least, linear epitopes in a denatured polypeptide (e.g., in Western blotting).","Epitope-bearing polypeptides of the present invention may be used to induce antibodies according to methods well known in the art including, but not limited to, in vivo immunization, in vitro immunization, and phage display methods. See, e.g., Sutcliffe et al., supra; Wilson et al., supra, and Bittle et al., J. Gen. Virol., 66:2347-2354 (1985). If in vivo immunization is used, animals may be immunized with free peptide; however, anti-peptide antibody titer may be boosted by coupling the peptide to a macromolecular carrier, such as keyhole limpet hemacyanin (KLH) or tetanus toxoid. For instance, peptides containing cysteine residues may be coupled to a carrier using a linker such as maleimidobenzoyl-N-hydroxysuccinimide ester (MBS), while other peptides may be coupled to carriers using a more general linking agent such as glutaraldehyde. Animals such as rabbits, rats and mice are immunized with either free or carrier-coupled peptides, for instance, by intraperitoneal and\/or intradermal injection of emulsions containing about 100 \u03bcg of peptide or carrier protein and Freund's adjuvant or any other adjuvant known for stimulating an immune response. Several booster injections may be needed, for instance, at intervals of about two weeks, to provide a useful titer of anti-peptide antibody which can be detected, for example, by ELISA assay using free peptide adsorbed to a solid surface. The titer of anti-peptide antibodies in serum from an immunized animal may be increased by selection of anti-peptide antibodies, for instance, by adsorption to the peptide on a solid support and elution of the selected antibodies according to methods well known in the art.","As one of skill in the art will appreciate, and as discussed above, the polypeptides of the present invention comprising an immunogenic or antigenic epitope can be fused to other polypeptide sequences. For example, the polypeptides of the present invention may be fused with the constant domain of immunoglobulins (IgA, IgE, IgG, IgM), or portions thereof (CH1, CH2, CH3, or any combination thereof and portions thereof) resulting in chimeric polypeptides. Such fusion proteins may facilitate purification and may increase half-life in vivo. This has been shown for chimeric proteins consisting of the first two domains of the human CD4-polypeptide and various domains of the constant regions of the heavy or light chains of mammalian immunoglobulins. See, e.g., EP 394,827; Traunecker et al., Nature, 331:84-86 (1988). Enhanced delivery of an antigen across the epithelial barrier to the immune system has been demonstrated for antigens (e.g., insulin) conjugated to an FcRn binding partner such as IgG or Fc fragments (see, e.g., PCT Publications WO 96\/22024 and WO 99\/04813). IgG Fusion proteins that have a disulfide-linked dimeric structure due to the IgG portion disulfide bonds have also been found to be more efficient in binding and neutralizing other molecules than monomeric polypeptides or fragments thereof alone. See, e.g., Fountoulakis et al., J. Biochem., 270:3958-3964 (1995). Nucleic acids encoding the above epitopes can also be recombined with a gene of interest as an epitope tag (e.g., the hemagglutinin (\u201cHA\u201d) tag or flag tag) to aid in detection and purification of the expressed polypeptide. For example, a system described by Janknecht et al. allows for the ready purification of non-denatured fusion proteins expressed in human cell lines (Janknecht et al., 1991, Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. USA 88:8972-897). In this system, the gene of interest is subcloned into a vaccinia recombination plasmid such that the open reading frame of the gene is translationally fused to an amino-terminal tag consisting of six histidine residues. The tag serves as a matrix binding domain for the fusion protein. Extracts from cells infected with the recombinant vaccinia virus are loaded onto Ni2+ nitriloacetic acid-agarose column and histidine-tagged proteins can be selectively eluted with imidazole-containing buffers.","Additional fusion proteins of the invention may be generated through the techniques of gene-shuffling, motif-shuffling, exon-shuffling, and\/or codon-shuffling (collectively referred to as \u201cDNA shuffling\u201d). DNA shuffling may be employed to modulate the activities of polypeptides of the invention, such methods can be used to generate polypeptides with altered activity, as well as agonists and antagonists of the polypeptides. See, generally, U.S. Pat. Nos. 5,605,793; 5,811,238; 5,830,721; 5,834,252; and 5,837,458, and Patten et al., Curr. Opinion Biotechnol. 8:724-33 (1997); Harayama, Trends Biotechnol. 16(2):76-82 (1998); Hansson, et al., J. Mol. Biol. 287:265-76 (1999); and Lorenzo and Blasco, Biotechniques 24(2):308-13 (1998) (each of these patents and publications are hereby incorporated by reference in its entirety). In one embodiment, alteration of polynucleotides corresponding to SEQ ID NO:1, 3, 5, 7, 9 and\/or 11 and the polypeptides encoded by these polynucleotides may be achieved by DNA shuffling. DNA shuffling involves the assembly of two or more DNA segments by homologous or site-specific recombination to generate variation in the polynucleotide sequence. In another embodiment, polynucleotides of the invention, or the encoded polypeptides, may be altered by being subjected to random mutagenesis by error-prone PCR, random nucleotide insertion or other methods prior to recombination. In another embodiment, one or more components, motifs, sections, parts, domains, fragments, etc., of a polynucleotide encoding a polypeptide of the invention may be recombined with one or more components, motifs, sections, parts, domains, fragments, etc. of one or more heterologous molecules.","Further polypeptides of the invention relate to antibodies and T-cell antigen receptors (TCR) which immunospecifically bind a polypeptide, polypeptide fragment, or variant of SEQ ID NO:2, 4, 6, 8, 10 and\/or 12, and\/or an epitope, of the present invention (as determined by immunoassays well known in the art for assaying specific antibody-antigen binding). Antibodies of the invention include, but are not limited to, polyclonal, monoclonal, monovalent, bispecific, heteroconjugate, multispecific, human, humanized or chimeric antibodies, single chain antibodies, Fab fragments, F(ab\u2032) fragments, fragments produced by a Fab expression library, anti-idiotypic (anti-Id) antibodies (including, e.g., anti-Id antibodies to antibodies of the invention), and epitope-binding fragments of any of the above. The term \u201cantibody,\u201d as used herein, refers to immunoglobulin molecules and immunologically active portions of immunoglobulin molecules, i.e., molecules that contain an antigen binding site that immunospecifically binds an antigen. The immunoglobulin molecules of the invention can be of any type (e.g., IgG, IgE, IgM, IgD, IgA and IgY), class (e.g., IgG1, IgG2, IgG3, IgG4, IgA1 and IgA2) or subclass of immunoglobulin molecule. Moreover, the term \u201cantibody\u201d (Ab) or \u201cmonoclonal antibody\u201d (Mab) is meant to include intact molecules, as well as, antibody fragments (such as, for example, Fab and F(ab\u2032)2 fragments) which are capable of specifically binding to protein. Fab and F(ab\u2032)2 fragments lack the Fc fragment of intact antibody, clear more rapidly from the circulation of the animal or plant, and may have less non-specific tissue binding than an intact antibody (Wahl et al., J. Nucl. Med. 24:316-325 (1983)). Thus, these fragments are preferred, as well as the products of a FAB or other immunoglobulin expression library. Moreover, antibodies of the present invention include chimeric, single chain, and humanized antibodies.","Most preferably the antibodies are human antigen-binding antibody fragments of the present invention and include, but are not limited to, Fab, Fab\u2032 and F(ab\u2032)2, Fd, single-chain Fvs (scFv), single-chain antibodies, disulfide-linked Fvs (sdFv) and fragments comprising either a VL or VH domain. Antigen-binding antibody fragments, including single-chain antibodies, may comprise the variable region(s) alone or in combination with the entirety or a portion of the following: hinge region, CH1, CH2, and CH3 domains. Also included in the invention are antigen-binding fragments also comprising any combination of variable region(s) with a hinge region, CH1, CH2, and CH3 domains. The antibodies of the invention may be from any animal origin including birds and mammals. Preferably, the antibodies are human, murine (e.g., mouse and rat), donkey, ship rabbit, goat, guinea pig, camel, horse, or chicken. As used herein, \u201chuman\u201d antibodies include antibodies having the amino acid sequence of a human immunoglobulin and include antibodies isolated from human immunoglobulin libraries or from animals transgenic for one or more human immunoglobulin and that do not express endogenous immunoglobulins, as described infra and, for example in, U.S. Pat. No. 5,939,598 by Kucherlapati et al.","The antibodies of the present invention may be monospecific, bispecific, trispecific or of greater multispecificity. Multispecific antibodies may be specific for different epitopes of a polypeptide of the present invention or may be specific for both a polypeptide of the present invention as well as for a heterologous epitope, such as a heterologous polypeptide or solid support material.

Preferred binding affinities include those with a dissociation constant or Kd less than 5\u00d710\u22122 M, 10\u22122 M, 5\u00d710\u22123 M, 10\u22123 M, 5\u00d710\u22124 M, 10\u22124 M, 5\u00d710\u22125 M, 10\u22125 M, 5\u00d710\u22126 M, 10\u22126M, 5\u00d710\u22127 M, 107 M, 5\u00d710\u22128 M, 10\u22128 M, 5\u00d710\u22129 M, 10\u22129 M, 5\u00d710\u221210 M, 10\u221210 M, 5\u00d710\u221211 M, 10\u221211 M, 5\u00d710\u221212 M, 10\u221212 M, 5\u00d710\u221213 M, 10\u221213 M, 5\u00d710\u221214 M, 10\u221214 M, 5\u00d710\u221215 M, or 10\u221215 M.","The invention also provides antibodies that competitively inhibit binding of an antibody to an epitope of the invention as determined by any method known in the art for determining competitive binding, for example, the immunoassays described herein. In preferred embodiments, the antibody competitively inhibits binding to the epitope by at least 95%, at least 90%, at least 85%, at least 80%, at least 75%, at least 70%, at least 60%, or at least 50%.","Antibodies of the present invention may act as agonists or antagonists of the polypeptides of the present invention. For example, the present invention includes antibodies which disrupt the receptor\/ligand interactions with the polypeptides of the invention either partially or fully. Preferably, antibodies of the present invention bind an antigenic epitope disclosed herein, or a portion thereof. The invention features both receptor-specific antibodies and ligand-specific antibodies. The invention also features receptor-specific antibodies which do not prevent ligand binding but prevent receptor activation. Receptor activation (i.e., signaling) may be determined by techniques described herein or otherwise known in the art. For example, receptor activation can be determined by detecting the phosphorylation (e.g., tyrosine or serine\/threonine) of the receptor or its substrate by immunoprecipitation followed by western blot analysis (for example, as described supra). In specific embodiments, antibodies are provided that inhibit ligand activity or receptor activity by at least 95%, at least 90%, at least 85%, at least 80%, at least 75%, at least 70%, at least 60%, or at least 50% of the activity in absence of the antibody.","The invention also features receptor-specific antibodies which both prevent ligand binding and receptor activation as well as antibodies that recognize the receptor-ligand complex, and, preferably, do not specifically recognize the unbound receptor or the unbound ligand. Likewise, included in the invention are neutralizing antibodies which bind the ligand and prevent binding of the ligand to the receptor, as well as antibodies which bind the ligand, thereby preventing receptor activation, but do not prevent the ligand from binding the receptor. Further included in the invention are antibodies which activate the receptor. These antibodies may act as receptor agonists, i.e., potentiate or activate either all or a subset of the biological activities of the ligand-mediated receptor activation, for example, by inducing dimerization of the receptor. The antibodies may be specified as agonists, antagonists or inverse agonists for biological activities comprising the specific biological activities of the peptides of the invention disclosed herein. The above antibody agonists can be made using methods known in the art. See, e.g., PCT publication WO 96\/40281; U.S. Pat.

For example, the antibodies have use in immunoassays for qualitatively and quantitatively measuring levels of the polypeptides of the present invention in biological samples. See, e.g., Harlow et al., Antibodies: A Laboratory Manual, (Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory Press, 2nd ed. 1988) (incorporated by reference herein in its entirety).","As discussed in more detail below, the antibodies of the present invention may be used either alone or in combination with other compositions. The antibodies may further be recombinantly fused to a heterologous polypeptide at the N- or C-terminus or chemically conjugated (including covalently and non-covalently conjugations) to polypeptides or other compositions. For example, antibodies of the present invention may be recombinantly fused or conjugated to molecules useful as labels in detection assays and effector molecules such as heterologous polypeptides, drugs, radionucleotides, or toxins. See, e.g., PCT publications WO 92\/08495; WO 91\/14438; WO 89\/12624; U.S. Pat. No. 5,314,995; and EP 396,387.","The antibodies of the invention include derivatives that are modified, i.e., by the covalent attachment of any type of molecule to the antibody such that covalent attachment does not prevent the antibody from generating an anti-idiotypic response. For example, but not by way of limitation, the antibody derivatives include antibodies that have been modified, e.g., by glycosylation, acetylation, pegylation, phosphorylation, amidation, derivatization by known protecting\/blocking groups, proteolytic cleavage, linkage to a cellular ligand or other protein, etc. Any of numerous chemical modifications may be carried out by known techniques, including, but not limited to specific chemical cleavage, acetylation, formylation, metabolic synthesis of tunicamycin, etc. Additionally, the derivative may contain one or more non-classical amino acids.","The antibodies of the present invention may be generated by any suitable method known in the art.","The antibodies of the present invention may comprise polyclonal antibodies. Methods of preparing polyclonal antibodies are known to the skilled artisan (Harlow, et al., Antibodies: A Laboratory Manual, (Cold spring Harbor Laboratory Press, 2ed. (1988); and Current Protocols, Chapter 2; which are hereby incorporated herein by reference in its entirety). In a preferred method, a preparation of the LTRPC3g, LTRPC3h, LTRPC3i, LTRPC3j, LTRPC3k, and\/or LTRPC3l protein is prepared and purified to render it substantially free of natural contaminants. Such a preparation is then introduced into an animal in order to produce polyclonal antisera of greater specific activity. For example, a polypeptide of the invention can be administered to various host animals including, but not limited to, rabbits, mice, rats, etc. to induce the production of sera containing polyclonal antibodies specific for the antigen. The administration of the polypeptides of the present invention may entail one or more injections of an immunizing agent and, if desired, an adjuvant. Various adjuvants may be used to increase the immunological response, depending on the host species, and include but are not limited to, Freund's (complete and incomplete), mineral gels such as aluminum hydroxide, surface active substances such as lysolecithin, pluronic polyols, polyanions, peptides, oil emulsions, keyhole limpet hemocyanins, dinitrophenol, and potentially useful human adjuvants such as BCG (bacille Calmette-Guerin) and . Such adjuvants are also well known in the art. For the purposes of the invention, \u201cimmunizing agent\u201d may be defined as a polypeptide of the invention, including fragments, variants, and\/or derivatives thereof, in addition to fusions with heterologous polypeptides and other forms of the polypeptides described herein.","Typically, the immunizing agent and\/or adjuvant will be injected in the mammal by multiple subcutaneous or intraperitoneal injections, though they may also be given intramuscularly, and\/or through IV). The immunizing agent may include polypeptides of the present invention or a fusion protein or variants thereof. Depending upon the nature of the polypeptides (i.e., percent hydrophobicity, percent hydrophilicity, stability, net charge, isoelectric point etc.), it may be useful to conjugate the immunizing agent to a protein known to be immunogenic in the mammal being immunized. Such conjugation includes either chemical conjugation by derivitizing active chemical functional groups to both the polypeptide of the present invention and the immunogenic protein such that a covalent bond is formed, or through fusion-protein based methodology, or other methods known to the skilled artisan. Examples of such immunogenic proteins include, but are not limited to keyhole limpet hemocyanin, serum albumin, bovine thyroglobulin, and soybean trypsin inhibitor. Various adjuvants may be used to increase the immunological response, depending on the host species, including but not limited to Freund's (complete and incomplete), mineral gels such as aluminum hydroxide, surface active substances such as lysolecithin, pluronic polyols, polyanions, peptides, oil emulsions, keyhole limpet hemocyanin, dinitrophenol, and potentially useful human adjuvants such as BCG (bacille Calmette-Guerin) and . Additional examples of adjuvants which may be employed includes the MPL-TDM adjuvant (monophosphoryl lipid A, synthetic trehalose dicorynomycolate). The immunization protocol may be selected by one skilled in the art without undue experimentation.","The antibodies of the present invention may comprise monoclonal antibodies. Monoclonal antibodies may be prepared using hybridoma methods, such as those described by Kohler and Milstein, Nature, 256:495 (1975) and U.S. Pat. No. 4,376,110, by Harlow, et al., Antibodies: A Laboratory Manual, (Cold spring Harbor Laboratory Press, 2ed. (1988), by Hammerling, et al., Monoclonal Antibodies and T-Cell Hybridomas (Elsevier, N.Y., pp. 563-681 (1981); K\u00f6hler et al., Eur. J. Immunol. 6:511 (1976); K\u00f6hler et al., Eur. J. Immunol. 6:292 (1976), or other methods known to the artisan. Other examples of methods which may be employed for producing monoclonal antibodies includes, but are not limited to, the human B-cell hybridoma technique (Kosbor et al., 1983, Immunology Today 4:72; Cole et al., 1983, Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. USA 80:2026-2030), and the EBV-hybridoma technique (Cole et al., 1985, Monoclonal Antibodies And Cancer Therapy, Alan R. Liss, Inc., pp. 77-96). Such antibodies may be of any immunoglobulin class including IgG, IgM, IgE, IgA, IgD and any subclass thereof. The hybridoma producing the mAb of this invention may be cultivated in vitro or in vivo. Production of high titers of mAbs in vivo makes this the presently preferred method of production.","In a hybridoma method, a mouse, a humanized mouse, a mouse with a human immune system, hamster, or other appropriate host animal, is typically immunized with an immunizing agent to elicit lymphocytes that produce or are capable of producing antibodies that will specifically bind to the immunizing agent. Alternatively, the lymphocytes may be immunized in vitro.","The immunizing agent will typically include polypeptides of the present invention or a fusion protein thereof. Preferably, the immunizing agent consists of an LTRPC3g, LTRPC3h, LTRPC3i, LTRPC3j, LTRPC3k, and\/or LTRPC3l polypeptide or, more preferably, with a LTRPC3g, LTRPC3h, LTRPC3i, LTRPC3j, LTRPC3k, and\/or LTRPC3l polypeptide-expressing cell. Such cells may be cultured in any suitable tissue culture medium; however, it is preferable to culture cells in Earle's modified Eagle's medium supplemented with 10% fetal bovine serum (inactivated at about 56 degrees C.), and supplemented with about 10 g\/l of nonessential amino acids, about 1,000 U\/ml of penicillin, and about 100 ug\/ml of streptomycin. Generally, either peripheral blood lymphocytes (\u201cPBLs\u201d) are used if cells of human origin are desired, or spleen cells or lymph node cells are used if non-human mammalian sources are desired. The lymphocytes are then fused with an immortalized cell line using a suitable fusing agent, such as polyethylene glycol, to form a hybridoma cell (Goding, Monoclonal Antibodies: Principles and Practice, Academic Press, (1986), pp. 59-103). Immortalized cell lines are usually transformed mammalian cells, particularly myeloma cells of rodent, bovine and human origin. Usually, rat or mouse myeloma cell lines are employed. The hybridoma cells may be cultured in a suitable culture medium that preferably contains one or more substances that inhibit the growth or survival of the unfused, immortalized cells. For example, if the parental cells lack the enzyme hypoxanthine guanine phosphoribosyl transferase (HGPRT or HPRT), the culture medium for the hybridomas typically will include hypoxanthine, aminopterin, and thymidine (\u201cHAT medium\u201d), which substances prevent the growth of HGPRT-deficient cells.","Preferred immortalized cell lines are those that fuse efficiently, support stable high level expression of antibody by the selected antibody-producing cells, and are sensitive to a medium such as HAT medium. More preferred immortalized cell lines are murine myeloma lines, which can be obtained, for instance, from the Salk Institute Cell Distribution Center, San Diego, Calif. and the American Type Culture Collection, Manassas, Va. More preferred are the parent myeloma cell line (SP2O) as provided by the ATCC. As inferred throughout the specification, human myeloma and mouse-human heteromyeloma cell lines also have been described for the production of human monoclonal antibodies (Kozbor, J. Immunol., 133:3001 (1984); Brodeur et al., Monoclonal Antibody Production Techniques and Applications, Marcel Dekker, Inc., New York, (1987) pp. 51-63).","The culture medium in which the hybridoma cells are cultured can then be assayed for the presence of monoclonal antibodies directed against the polypeptides of the present invention. Preferably, the binding specificity of monoclonal antibodies produced by the hybridoma cells is determined by immunoprecipitation or by an in vitro binding assay, such as radioimmunoassay (RIA) or enzyme-linked immunoabsorbant assay (ELISA). Such techniques are known in the art and within the skill of the artisan. The binding affinity of the monoclonal antibody can, for example, be determined by the Scatchard analysis of Munson and Pollart, Anal. Biochem., 107:220 (1980).","After the desired hybridoma cells are identified, the clones may be subcloned by limiting dilution procedures and grown by standard methods (Goding, supra, and\/or according to Wands et al. (Gastroenterology 80:225-232 (1981)). Suitable culture media for this purpose include, for example, Dulbecco's Modified Eagle's Medium and RPMI-1640. Alternatively, the hybridoma cells may be grown in vivo as ascites in a mammal.","The monoclonal antibodies secreted by the subclones may be isolated or purified from the culture medium or ascites fluid by conventional immunoglobulin purification procedures such as, for example, protein A-sepharose, hydroxyapatite chromatography, gel exclusion chromatography, gel electrophoresis, dialysis, or affinity chromatography.","The skilled artisan would acknowledge that a variety of methods exist in the art for the production of monoclonal antibodies and thus, the invention is not limited to their sole production in hydridomas. For example, the monoclonal antibodies may be made by recombinant DNA methods, such as those described in U.S. Pat. No. 4,816,567. In this context, the term \u201cmonoclonal antibody\u201d refers to an antibody derived from a single eukaryotic, phage, or prokaryotic clone. The DNA encoding the monoclonal antibodies of the invention can be readily isolated and sequenced using conventional procedures (e.g., by using oligonucleotide probes that are capable of binding specifically to genes encoding the heavy and light chains of murine antibodies, or such chains from human, humanized, or other sources). The hydridoma cells of the invention serve as a preferred source of such DNA. Once isolated, the DNA may be placed into expression vectors, which are then transformed into host cells such as Simian COS cells, Chinese hamster ovary (CHO) cells, or myeloma cells that do not otherwise produce immunoglobulin protein, to obtain the synthesis of monoclonal antibodies in the recombinant host cells. The DNA also may be modified, for example, by substituting the coding sequence for human heavy and light chain constant domains in place of the homologous murine sequences (U.S. Pat. No. 4,816,567; Morrison et al, supra) or by covalently joining to the immunoglobulin coding sequence all or part of the coding sequence for a non-immunoglobulin polypeptide. Such a non-immunoglobulin polypeptide can be substituted for the constant domains of an antibody of the invention, or can be substituted for the variable domains of one antigen-combining site of an antibody of the invention to create a chimeric bivalent antibody.","The antibodies may be monovalent antibodies. Methods for preparing monovalent antibodies are well known in the art. For example, one method involves recombinant expression of immunoglobulin light chain and modified heavy chain. The heavy chain is truncated generally at any point in the Fc region so as to prevent heavy chain crosslinking. Alternatively, the relevant cysteine residues are substituted with another amino acid residue or are deleted so as to prevent crosslinking.","In vitro methods are also suitable for preparing monovalent antibodies. Digestion of antibodies to produce fragments thereof, particularly, Fab fragments, can be accomplished using routine techniques known in the art. Monoclonal antibodies can be prepared using a wide variety of techniques known in the art including the use of hybridoma, recombinant, and phage display technologies, or a combination thereof. For example, monoclonal antibodies can be produced using hybridoma techniques including those known in the art and taught, for example, in Harlow et al., Antibodies: A Laboratory Manual, (Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory Press, 2nd ed. 1988); Hammerling, et al., in: Monoclonal Antibodies and T-Cell Hybridomas 563-681 (Elsevier, N.Y., 1981) (said references incorporated by reference in their entireties). The term \u201cmonoclonal antibody\u201d as used herein is not limited to antibodies produced through hybridoma technology. The term \u201cmonoclonal antibody\u201d refers to an antibody that is derived from a single clone, including any eukaryotic, prokaryotic, or phage clone, and not the method by which it is produced.","Methods for producing and screening for specific antibodies using hybridoma technology are routine and well known in the art and are discussed in detail in the Examples described herein. In a non-limiting example, mice can be immunized with a polypeptide of the invention or a cell expressing such peptide. Once an immune response is detected, e.g., antibodies specific for the antigen are detected in the mouse serum, the mouse spleen is harvested and splenocytes isolated. The splenocytes are then fused by well known techniques to any suitable myeloma cells, for example cells from cell line SP20 available from the ATCC. Hybridomas are selected and cloned by limited dilution. The hybridoma clones are then assayed by methods known in the art for cells that secrete antibodies capable of binding a polypeptide of the invention. Ascites fluid, which generally contains high levels of antibodies, can be generated by immunizing mice with positive hybridoma clones.","Accordingly, the present invention provides methods of generating monoclonal antibodies as well as antibodies produced by the method comprising culturing a hybridoma cell secreting an antibody of the invention wherein, preferably, the hybridoma is generated by fusing splenocytes isolated from a mouse immunized with an antigen of the invention with myeloma cells and then screening the hybridomas resulting from the fusion for hybridoma clones that secrete an antibody able to bind a polypeptide of the invention.","Antibody fragments which recognize specific epitopes may be generated by known techniques. For example, Fab and F(ab\u2032)2 fragments of the invention may be produced by proteolytic cleavage of immunoglobulin molecules, using enzymes such as papain (to produce Fab fragments) or pepsin (to produce F(ab\u2032)2 fragments). F(ab\u2032)2 fragments contain the variable region, the light chain constant region and the CH1 domain of the heavy chain.","For example, the antibodies of the present invention can also be generated using various phage display methods known in the art. In phage display methods, functional antibody domains are displayed on the surface of phage particles which carry the polynucleotide sequences encoding them. In a particular embodiment, such phage can be utilized to display antigen binding domains expressed from a repertoire or combinatorial antibody library (e.g., human or murine). Phage expressing an antigen binding domain that binds the antigen of interest can be selected or identified with antigen, e.g., using labeled antigen or antigen bound or captured to a solid surface or bead. Phage used in these methods are typically filamentous phage including fd and M13 binding domains expressed from phage with Fab, Fv or disulfide stabilized Fv antibody domains recombinantly fused to either the phage gene III or gene VIII protein. Examples of phage display methods that can be used to make the antibodies of the present invention include those disclosed in Brinkman et al., J. Immunol. Methods 182:41-50 (1995); Ames et al., J. Immunol. Methods 184:177-186 (1995); Kettleborough et al., Eur. J.

For example, techniques to recombinantly produce Fab, Fab\u2032 and F(ab\u2032)2 fragments can also be employed using methods known in the art such as those disclosed in PCT publication WO 92\/22324; Mullinax et al., BioTechniques 12(6):864-869 (1992); and Sawai et al., AJRI 34:26-34 (1995); and Better et al., Science 240:1041-1043 (1988) (said references incorporated by reference in their entireties). Examples of techniques which can be used to produce single-chain Fvs and antibodies include those described in U.S. Pat. Nos. 4,946,778 and 5,258,498; Huston et al., Methods in Enzymology 203:46-88 (1991); Shu et al., PNAS 90:7995-7999 (1993); and Skerra et al., Science 240:1038-1040 (1988).","For some uses, including in vivo use of antibodies in humans and in vitro detection assays, it may be preferable to use chimeric, humanized, or human antibodies. A chimeric antibody is a molecule in which different portions of the antibody are derived from different animal species, such as antibodies having a variable region derived from a murine monoclonal antibody and a human immunoglobulin constant region. Methods for producing chimeric antibodies are known in the art. See e.g., Morrison, Science 229:1202 (1985); Oi et al., BioTechniques 4:214 (1986); Gillies et al., (1989) J. Immunol. Methods 125:191-202; Cabilly et al., Taniguchi et al., EP 171496; Morrison et al., EP 173494; Neuberger et al., WO 8601533; Robinson et al., WO 8702671; Boulianne et al., Nature 312:643 (1984); Neuberger et al., Nature 314:268 (1985); U.S. Pat. Nos. 5,807,715; 4,816,567; and 4,816,397, which are incorporated herein by reference in their entirety. Humanized antibodies are antibody molecules from non-human species antibody that binds the desired antigen having one or more complementarity determining regions (CDRs) from the non-human species and a framework regions from a human immunoglobulin molecule. Often, framework residues in the human framework regions will be substituted with the corresponding residue from the CDR donor antibody to alter, preferably improve, antigen binding. These framework substitutions are identified by methods well known in the art, e.g., by modeling of the interactions of the CDR and framework residues to identify framework residues important for antigen binding and sequence comparison to identify unusual framework residues at particular positions. (See, e.g., Queen et al., U.S. Pat. No. 5,585,089; Riechmann et al., Nature 332:323 (1988), which are incorporated herein by reference in their entireties.) Antibodies can be humanized using a variety of techniques known in the art including, for example, CDR-grafting (EP 239,400; PCT publication WO 91\/09967; U.S. Pat. Nos. 5,225,539; 5,530,101; and 5,585,089), veneering or resurfacing (EP 592,106; EP 519,596; Padlan, Molecular Immunology 28(4\/5):489-498 (1991); Studnicka et al., Protein Engineering 7(6):805-814 (1994); Roguska. et al., PNAS 91:969-973 (1994)), and chain shuffling (U.S. Pat. No. 5,565,332). Generally, a humanized antibody has one or more amino acid residues introduced into it from a source that is non-human. These non-human amino acid residues are often referred to as \u201cimport\u201d residues, which are typically taken from an \u201cimport\u201d variable domain. Humanization can be essentially performed following the methods of Winter and co-workers (Jones et al., Nature, 321:522-525 (1986); Reichmann et al., Nature, 332:323-327 (1988); Verhoeyen et al., Science, 239:1534-1536 (1988), by substituting rodent CDRs or CDR sequences for the corresponding sequences of a human antibody. Accordingly, such \u201chumanized\u201d antibodies are chimeric antibodies (U.S. Pat. No. 4,816,567), wherein substantially less than an intact human variable domain has been substituted by the corresponding sequence from a non-human species. In practice, humanized antibodies are typically human antibodies in which some CDR residues and possible some FR residues are substituted from analogous sites in rodent antibodies.","In general, the humanized antibody will comprise substantially all of at least one, and typically two, variable domains, in which all or substantially all of the CDR regions correspond to those of a non-human immunoglobulin and all or substantially all of the FR regions are those of a human immunoglobulin consensus sequence. The humanized antibody optimally also will comprise at least a portion of an immunoglobulin constant region (Fc), typically that of a human immunoglobulin (Jones et al., Nature, 321:522-525 (1986); Riechmann et al., Nature 332:323-329 (1988)1 and Presta, Curr. Op. Struct. Biol., 2:593-596 (1992).","Completely human antibodies are particularly desirable for therapeutic treatment of human patients. Human antibodies can be made by a variety of methods known in the art including phage display methods described above using antibody libraries derived from human immunoglobulin sequences. See also, U.S. Pat. Nos. 4,444,887 and 4,716,111; and PCT publications WO 98\/46645, WO 98\/50433, WO 98\/24893, WO 98\/16654, WO 96\/34096, WO 96\/33735, and WO 91\/10741; each of which is incorporated herein by reference in its entirety. The techniques of cole et al., and Boerder et al., are also available for the preparation of human monoclonal antibodies (cole et al., Monoclonal Antibodies and Cancer Therapy, Alan R. Riss, (1985); and Boerner et al., J. Immunol., 147(1):86-95, (1991)).","Human antibodies can also be produced using transgenic mice which are incapable of expressing functional endogenous immunoglobulins, but which can express human immunoglobulin genes. For example, the human heavy and light chain immunoglobulin gene complexes may be introduced randomly or by homologous recombination into mouse embryonic stem cells. Alternatively, the human variable region, constant region, and diversity region may be introduced into mouse embryonic stem cells in addition to the human heavy and light chain genes. The mouse heavy and light chain immunoglobulin genes may be rendered non-functional separately or simultaneously with the introduction of human immunoglobulin loci by homologous recombination. In particular, homozygous deletion of the JH region prevents endogenous antibody production. The modified embryonic stem cells are expanded and microinjected into blastocysts to produce chimeric mice. The chimeric mice are then bred to produce homozygous offspring which express human antibodies. The transgenic mice are immunized in the normal fashion with a selected antigen, e.g., all or a portion of a polypeptide of the invention. Monoclonal antibodies directed against the antigen can be obtained from the immunized, transgenic mice using conventional hybridoma technology. The human immunoglobulin transgenes harbored by the transgenic mice rearrange during B cell differentiation, and subsequently undergo class switching and somatic mutation. Thus, using such a technique, it is possible to produce therapeutically useful IgG, IgA, IgM and IgE antibodies. For an overview of this technology for producing human antibodies, see Lonberg and Huszar, Int. Rev. Immunol. 13:65-93 (1995). For a detailed discussion of this technology for producing human antibodies and human monoclonal antibodies and protocols for producing such antibodies, see, e.g., PCT publications WO 98\/24893; WO 92\/01047; WO 96\/34096; WO 96\/33735; European Patent No. 0 598 877; U.S. Pat. Nos. 5,413,923; 5,625,126; 5,633,425; 5,569,825; 5,661,016; 5,545,806; 5,814,318; 5,885,793; 5,916,771; and 5,939,598, which are incorporated by reference herein in their entirety. In addition, companies such as Abgenix, Inc. (Freemont, Calif.), Genpharm (San Jose, Calif.), and Medarex, Inc. (Princeton, N.J.) can be engaged to provide human antibodies directed against a selected antigen using technology similar to that described above.","Similarly, human antibodies can be made by introducing human immunoglobulin loci into transgenic animals, e.g., mice in which the endogenous immunoglobulin genes have been partially or completely inactivated. Upon challenge, human antibody production is observed, which closely resembles that seen in humans in all respects, including gene rearrangement, assembly, and creation of an antibody repertoire. This approach is described, for example, in U.S. Pat. Nos. 5,545,807; 5,545,806; 5,569,825; 5,625,126; 5,633,425; 5,661,106, and in the following scientific publications: Marks et al., Biotechnol., 10:779-783 (1992); Lonberg et al., Nature 368:856-859 (1994); Fishwild et al., Nature Biotechnol., 14:845-51 (1996); Neuberger, Nature Biotechnol., 14:826 (1996); Lonberg and Huszer, Intern. Rev. Immunol., 13:65-93 (1995).","Completely human antibodies which recognize a selected epitope can be generated using a technique referred to as \u201cguided selection.\u201d In this approach a selected non-human monoclonal antibody, e.g., a mouse antibody, is used to guide the selection of a completely human antibody recognizing the same epitope. (Jespers et al., Bio\/technology 12:899-903 (1988)).","Further, antibodies to the polypeptides of the invention can, in turn, be utilized to generate anti-idiotype antibodies that \u201cmimic\u201d polypeptides of the invention using techniques well known to those skilled in the art. (See, e.g., Greenspan & Bona, FASEB J. 7(5):437-444; (1989) and Nissinoff, J. Immunol. 147(8):2429-2438 (1991)). For example, antibodies which bind to and competitively inhibit polypeptide multimerization and\/or binding of a polypeptide of the invention to a ligand can be used to generate anti-idiotypes that \u201cmimic\u201d the polypeptide multimerization and\/or binding domain and, as a consequence, bind to and neutralize polypeptide and\/or its ligand. Such neutralizing anti-idiotypes or Fab fragments of such anti-idiotypes can be used in therapeutic regimens to neutralize polypeptide ligand. For example, such anti-idiotypic antibodies can be used to bind a polypeptide of the invention and\/or to bind its ligands\/receptors, and thereby block its biological activity.","Such anti-idiotypic antibodies capable of binding to the LTRPC3g, LTRPC3h, LTRPC3i, LTRPC3j, LTRPC3k, and\/or LTRPC3l polypeptide can be produced in a two-step procedure. Such a method makes use of the fact that antibodies are themselves antigens, and therefore, it is possible to obtain an antibody that binds to a second antibody. In accordance with this method, protein specific antibodies are used to immunize an animal, preferably a mouse. The splenocytes of such an animal are then used to produce hybridoma cells, and the hybridoma cells are screened to identify clones that produce an antibody whose ability to bind to the protein-specific antibody can be blocked by the polypeptide. Such antibodies comprise anti-idiotypic antibodies to the protein-specific antibody and can be used to immunize an animal to induce formation of further protein-specific antibodies.","The antibodies of the present invention may be bispecific antibodies. Bispecific antibodies are monoclonal, Preferably human or humanized, antibodies that have binding specificities for at least two different antigens. In the present invention, one of the binding specificities may be directed towards a polypeptide of the present invention, the other may be for any other antigen, and preferably for a cell-surface protein, receptor, receptor subunit, tissue-specific antigen, virally derived protein, virally encoded envelope protein, bacterially derived protein, or bacterial surface protein, etc.","Methods for making bispecific antibodies are known in the art. Traditionally, the recombinant production of bispecific antibodies is based on the co-expression of two immunoglobulin heavy-chain\/light-chain pairs, where the two heavy chains have different specificities (Milstein and Cuello, Nature, 305:537-539 (1983). Because of the random assortment of immunoglobulin heavy and light chains, these hybridomas (quadromas) produce a potential mixture of ten different antibody molecules, of which only one has the correct bispecific structure. The purification of the correct molecule is usually accomplished by affinity chromatography steps. Similar procedures are disclosed in WO 93\/08829, published 13 May 1993, and in Traunecker et al., EMBO J., 10:3655-3659 (1991).","Antibody variable domains with the desired binding specificities (antibody-antigen combining sites) can be fused to immunoglobulin constant domain sequences. The fusion preferably is with an immunoglobulin heavy-chain constant domain, comprising at least part of the hinge, CH2, and CH3 regions. It is preferred to have the first heavy-chain constant region (CH1) containing the site necessary for light-chain binding present in at least one of the fusions. DNAs encoding the immunoglobulin heavy-chain fusions and, if desired, the immunoglobulin light chain, are inserted into separate expression vectors, and are co-transformed into a suitable host organism. For further details of generating bispecific antibodies see, for example Suresh et al., Meth. In Enzym., 121:210 (1986).","Heteroconjugate antibodies are also contemplated by the present invention. Heteroconjugate antibodies are composed of two covalently joined antibodies. Such antibodies have, for example, been proposed to target immune system cells to unwanted cells (U.S. Pat. No. 4,676,980), and for the treatment of HIV infection (WO 91\/00360; WO 92\/20373; and EP03089). It is contemplated that the antibodies may be prepared in vitro using known methods in synthetic protein chemistry, including those involving crosslinking agents. For example, immunotoxins may be constructed using a disulfide exchange reaction or by forming a thioester bond. Examples of suitable reagents for this purpose include iminothiolate and methyl-4-mercaptobutyrimidate and those disclosed, for example, in U.S. Pat. No. 4,676,980.","The invention further provides polynucleotides comprising a nucleotide sequence encoding an antibody of the invention and fragments thereof. The invention also encompasses polynucleotides that hybridize under stringent or lower stringency hybridization conditions, e.g., as defined supra, to polynucleotides that encode an antibody, preferably, that specifically binds to a polypeptide of the invention, preferably, an antibody that binds to a polypeptide having the amino acid sequence of SEQ ID NO:2, 4, 6, 8, 10 and\/or 12.","The polynucleotides may be obtained, and the nucleotide sequence of the polynucleotides determined, by any method known in the art. For example, if the nucleotide sequence of the antibody is known, a polynucleotide encoding the antibody may be assembled from chemically synthesized oligonucleotides (e.g., as described in Kutmeier et al., BioTechniques 17:242 (1994)), which, briefly, involves the synthesis of overlapping oligonucleotides containing portions of the sequence encoding the antibody, annealing and ligating of those oligonucleotides, and then amplification of the ligated oligonucleotides by PCR.","Alternatively, a polynucleotide encoding an antibody may be generated from nucleic acid from a suitable source. If a clone containing a nucleic acid encoding a particular antibody is not available, but the sequence of the antibody molecule is known, a nucleic acid encoding the immunoglobulin may be chemically synthesized or obtained from a suitable source (e.g., an antibody cDNA library, or a cDNA library generated from, or nucleic acid, preferably poly A+ RNA, isolated from, any tissue or cells expressing the antibody, such as hybridoma cells selected to express an antibody of the invention) by PCR amplification using synthetic primers hybridizable to the 3\u2032 and 5\u2032 ends of the sequence or by cloning using an oligonucleotide probe specific for the particular gene sequence to identify, e.g., a cDNA clone from a cDNA library that encodes the antibody. Amplified nucleic acids generated by PCR may then be cloned into replicable cloning vectors using any method well known in the art.","Once the nucleotide sequence and corresponding amino acid sequence of the antibody is determined, the nucleotide sequence of the antibody may be manipulated using methods well known in the art for the manipulation of nucleotide sequences, e.g., recombinant DNA techniques, site directed mutagenesis, PCR, etc. (see, for example, the techniques described in Sambrook et al., 1990, Molecular Cloning, A Laboratory Manual, 2d Ed., Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory, Cold Spring Harbor, N.Y. and Ausubel et al., eds., 1998, Current Protocols in Molecular Biology, John Wiley & Sons, N.Y., which are both incorporated by reference herein in their entireties), to generate antibodies having a different amino acid sequence, for example to create amino acid substitutions, deletions, and\/or insertions.","In a specific embodiment, the amino acid sequence of the heavy and\/or light chain variable domains may be inspected to identify the sequences of the complementarity determining regions (CDRs) by methods that are well know in the art, e.g., by comparison to known amino acid sequences of other heavy and light chain variable regions to determine the regions of sequence hypervariability. Using routine recombinant DNA techniques, one or more of the CDRs may be inserted within framework regions, e.g., into human framework regions to humanize a non-human antibody, as described supra. The framework regions may be naturally occurring or consensus framework regions, and preferably human framework regions (see, e.g., Chothia et al., J. Mol. Biol. 278: 457-479 (1998) for a listing of human framework regions). Preferably, the polynucleotide generated by the combination of the framework regions and CDRs encodes an antibody that specifically binds a polypeptide of the invention. Preferably, as discussed supra, one or more amino acid substitutions may be made within the framework regions, and, preferably, the amino acid substitutions improve binding of the antibody to its antigen. Additionally, such methods may be used to make amino acid substitutions or deletions of one or more variable region cysteine residues participating in an intrachain disulfide bond to generate antibody molecules lacking one or more intrachain disulfide bonds. Other alterations to the polynucleotide are encompassed by the present invention and within the skill of the art.","In addition, techniques developed for the production of \u201cchimeric antibodies\u201d (Morrison et al., Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. 81:851-855 (1984); Neuberger et al., Nature 312:604-608 (1984); Takeda et al., Nature 314:452-454 (1985)) by splicing genes from a mouse antibody molecule of appropriate antigen specificity together with genes from a human antibody molecule of appropriate biological activity can be used. As described supra, a chimeric antibody is a molecule in which different portions are derived from different animal species, such as those having a variable region derived from a murine mAb and a human immunoglobulin constant region, e.g., humanized antibodies.","Alternatively, techniques described for the production of single chain antibodies (U.S. Pat. No. 4,946,778; Bird, Science 242:423-42 (1988); Huston et al., Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. USA 85:5879-5883 (1988); and Ward et al., Nature 334:544-54 (1989)) can be adapted to produce single chain antibodies. Single chain antibodies are formed by linking the heavy and light chain fragments of the Fv region via an amino acid bridge, resulting in a single chain polypeptide. Techniques for the assembly of functional Fv fragments in may also be used (Skerra et al., Science 242:1038-1041 (1988)).","More preferably, a clone encoding an antibody of the present invention may be obtained according to the method described in the Example section herein.","The antibodies of the invention can be produced by any method known in the art for the synthesis of antibodies, in particular, by chemical synthesis or preferably, by recombinant expression techniques.","Recombinant expression of an antibody of the invention, or fragment, derivative or analog thereof, (e.g., a heavy or light chain of an antibody of the invention or a single chain antibody of the invention), requires construction of an expression vector containing a polynucleotide that encodes the antibody. Once a polynucleotide encoding an antibody molecule or a heavy or light chain of an antibody, or portion thereof (preferably containing the heavy or light chain variable domain), of the invention has been obtained, the vector for the production of the antibody molecule may be produced by recombinant DNA technology using techniques well known in the art. Thus, methods for preparing a protein by expressing a polynucleotide containing an antibody encoding nucleotide sequence are described herein. Methods which are well known to those skilled in the art can be used to construct expression vectors containing antibody coding sequences and appropriate transcriptional and translational control signals. These methods include, for example, in vitro recombinant DNA techniques, synthetic techniques, and in vivo genetic recombination. The invention, thus, provides replicable vectors comprising a nucleotide sequence encoding an antibody molecule of the invention, or a heavy or light chain thereof, or a heavy or light chain variable domain, operably linked to a promoter. Such vectors may include the nucleotide sequence encoding the constant region of the antibody molecule (see, e.g., PCT Publication WO 86\/05807; PCT Publication WO 89\/01036; and U.S. Pat. No. 5,122,464) and the variable domain of the antibody may be cloned into such a vector for expression of the entire heavy or light chain.","The expression vector is transferred to a host cell by conventional techniques and the transfected cells are then cultured by conventional techniques to produce an antibody of the invention. Thus, the invention includes host cells containing a polynucleotide encoding an antibody of the invention, or a heavy or light chain thereof, or a single chain antibody of the invention, operably linked to a heterologous promoter. In preferred embodiments for the expression of double-chained antibodies, vectors encoding both the heavy and light chains may be co-expressed in the host cell for expression of the entire immunoglobulin molecule, as detailed below.","A variety of host-expression vector systems may be utilized to express the antibody molecules of the invention. Such host-expression systems represent vehicles by which the coding sequences of interest may be produced and subsequently purified, but also represent cells which may, when transformed or transfected with the appropriate nucleotide coding sequences, express an antibody molecule of the invention in situ. These include but are not limited to microorganisms such as bacteria (e.g., ) transformed with recombinant bacteriophage DNA, plasmid DNA or cosmid DNA expression vectors containing antibody coding sequences; yeast (e.g., ) transformed with recombinant yeast expression vectors containing antibody coding sequences; insect cell systems infected with recombinant virus expression vectors (e.g., baculovirus) containing antibody coding sequences; plant cell systems infected with recombinant virus expression vectors (e.g., cauliflower mosaic virus, CaMV; tobacco mosaic virus, TMV) or transformed with recombinant plasmid expression vectors (e.g., Ti plasmid) containing antibody coding sequences; or mammalian cell systems (e.g., COS, CHO, BHK, 293, 3T3 cells) harboring recombinant expression constructs containing promoters derived from the genome of mammalian cells (e.g., metallothionein promoter) or from mammalian viruses (e.g., the adenovirus late promoter; the vaccinia virus 7.5K promoter). Preferably, bacterial cells such as , and more preferably, eukaryotic cells, especially for the expression of whole recombinant antibody molecule, are used for the expression of a recombinant antibody molecule. For example, mammalian cells such as Chinese hamster ovary cells (CHO), in conjunction with a vector such as the major intermediate early gene promoter element from human cytomegalovirus is an effective expression system for antibodies (Foecking et al., Gene 45:101 (1986); Cockett et al., Bio\/Technology 8:2 (1990)).","In bacterial systems, a number of expression vectors may be advantageously selected depending upon the use intended for the antibody molecule being expressed. For example, when a large quantity of such a protein is to be produced, for the generation of pharmaceutical compositions of an antibody molecule, vectors which direct the expression of high levels of fusion protein products that are readily purified may be desirable. Such vectors include, but are not limited, to the expression vector pUR278 (Ruther et al., EMBO J. 2:1791 (1983)), in which the antibody coding sequence may be ligated individually into the vector in frame with the lac Z coding region so that a fusion protein is produced; pIN vectors (Inouye & Inouye, Nucleic Acids Res. 13:3101-3109 (1985); Van Heeke & Schuster, J. Biol. Chem. 24:5503-5509 (1989)); and the like. pGEX vectors may also be used to express foreign polypeptides as fusion proteins with glutathione S-transferase (GST). In general, such fusion proteins are soluble and can easily be purified from lysed cells by adsorption and binding to matrix glutathione-agarose beads followed by elution in the presence of free glutathione. The pGEX vectors are designed to include thrombin or factor Xa protease cleavage sites so that the cloned target gene product can be released from the GST moiety.","In an insect system, nuclear polyhedrosis virus (AcNPV) is used as a vector to express foreign genes. The virus grows in cells. The antibody coding sequence may be cloned individually into non-essential regions (for example the polyhedrin gene) of the virus and placed under control of an AcNPV promoter (for example the polyhedrin promoter).","In mammalian host cells, a number of viral-based expression systems may be utilized. In cases where an adenovirus is used as an expression vector, the antibody coding sequence of interest may be ligated to an adenovirus transcription\/translation control complex, e.g., the late promoter and tripartite leader sequence. This chimeric gene may then be inserted in the adenovirus genome by in vitro or in vivo recombination. Insertion in a non-essential region of the viral genome (e.g., region E1 or E3) will result in a recombinant virus that is viable and capable of expressing the antibody molecule in infected hosts. (e.g., see Logan & Shenk, Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. USA 81:355-359 (1984)). Specific initiation signals may also be required for efficient translation of inserted antibody coding sequences. These signals include the ATG initiation codon and adjacent sequences. Furthermore, the initiation codon must be in phase with the reading frame of the desired coding sequence to ensure translation of the entire insert. These exogenous translational control signals and initiation codons can be of a variety of origins, both natural and synthetic. The efficiency of expression may be enhanced by the inclusion of appropriate transcription enhancer elements, transcription terminators, etc. (see Bittner et al., Methods in Enzymol. 153:51-544 (1987)).","In addition, a host cell strain may be chosen which modulates the expression of the inserted sequences, or modifies and processes the gene product in the specific fashion desired. Such modifications (e.g., glycosylation) and processing (e.g., cleavage) of protein products may be important for the function of the protein. Different host cells have characteristic and specific mechanisms for the post-translational processing and modification of proteins and gene products. Appropriate cell lines or host systems can be chosen to ensure the correct modification and processing of the foreign protein expressed. To this end, eukaryotic host cells which possess the cellular machinery for proper processing of the primary transcript, glycosylation, and phosphorylation of the gene product may be used. Such mammalian host cells include but are not limited to CHO, VERY, BHK, Hela, COS, MDCK, 293, 3T3, WI38, and in particular, breast cancer cell lines such as, for example, BT483, Hs578T, HTB2, BT20 and T47D, and normal mammary gland cell line such as, for example, CRL7030 and Hs578Bst.","For long-term, high-yield production of recombinant proteins, stable expression is preferred. For example, cell lines which stably express the antibody molecule may be engineered. Rather than using expression vectors which contain viral origins of replication, host cells can be transformed with DNA controlled by appropriate expression control elements (e.g., promoter, enhancer, sequences, transcription terminators, polyadenylation sites, etc.), and a selectable marker. Following the introduction of the foreign DNA, engineered cells may be allowed to grow for 1-2 days in an enriched media, and then are switched to a selective media. The selectable marker in the recombinant plasmid confers resistance to the selection and allows cells to stably integrate the plasmid into their chromosomes and grow to form foci which in turn can be cloned and expanded into cell lines. This method may advantageously be used to engineer cell lines which express the antibody molecule. Such engineered cell lines may be particularly useful in screening and evaluation of compounds that interact directly or indirectly with the antibody molecule.","A number of selection systems may be used, including but not limited to the herpes simplex virus thymidine kinase (Wigler et al., Cell 11:223 (1977)), hypoxanthine-guanine phosphoribosyltransferase (Szybalska & Szybalski, Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. USA 48:202 (1992)), and adenine phosphoribosyltransferase (Lowy et al., Cell 22:817 (1980)) genes can be employed in tk-, hgprt- or aprt-cells, respectively. Also, antimetabolite resistance can be used as the basis of selection for the following genes: dhfr, which confers resistance to methotrexate (Wigler et al., Natl. Acad. Sci. USA 77:357 (1980); O'Hare et al., Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. USA 78:1527 (1981)); gpt, which confers resistance to mycophenolic acid (Mulligan & Berg, Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. USA 78:2072 (1981)); neo, which confers resistance to the aminoglycoside G-418 Clinical Pharmacy 12:488-505; Wu and Wu, Biotherapy 3:87-95 (1991); Tolstoshev, Ann. Rev. Pharmacol. Toxicol. 32:573-596 (1993); Mulligan, Science 260:926-932 (1993); and Morgan and Anderson, Ann. Rev. Biochem. 62:191-217 (1993); May, 1993, TIB TECH 11(5):155-215); and hygro, which confers resistance to hygromycin (Santerre et al., Gene 30:147 (1984)). Methods commonly known in the art of recombinant DNA technology may be routinely applied to select the desired recombinant clone, and such methods are described, for example, in Ausubel et al. (eds.), Current Protocols in Molecular Biology, John Wiley & Sons, N.Y. (1993); Kriegler, Gene Transfer and Expression, A Laboratory Manual, Stockton Press, N.Y. (1990); and in Chapters 12 and 13, Dracopoli et al. (eds), Current Protocols in Human Genetics, John Wiley & Sons, N.Y. (1994); Colberre-Garapin et al., J. Mol. Biol. 150:1 (1981), which are incorporated by reference herein in their entireties.","The expression levels of an antibody molecule can be increased by vector amplification (for a review, see Bebbington and Hentschel, The use of vectors based on gene amplification for the expression of cloned genes in mammalian cells in DNA cloning, Vol. 3. (Academic Press, New York, 1987)). When a marker in the vector system expressing antibody is amplifiable, increase in the level of inhibitor present in culture of host cell will increase the number of copies of the marker gene. Since the amplified region is associated with the antibody gene, production of the antibody will also increase (Crouse et al., Mol. Cell. Biol. 3:257 (1983)).","The host cell may be co-transfected with two expression vectors of the invention, the first vector encoding a heavy chain derived polypeptide and the second vector encoding a light chain derived polypeptide. The two vectors may contain identical selectable markers which enable equal expression of heavy and light chain polypeptides. Alternatively, a single vector may be used which encodes, and is capable of expressing, both heavy and light chain polypeptides. In such situations, the light chain should be placed before the heavy chain to avoid an excess of toxic free heavy chain (Proudfoot, Nature 322:52 (1986); Kohler, Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. USA 77:2197 (1980)). The coding sequences for the heavy and light chains may comprise cDNA or genomic DNA.","Once an antibody molecule of the invention has been produced by an animal, chemically synthesized, or recombinantly expressed, it may be purified by any method known in the art for purification of an immunoglobulin molecule, for example, by chromatography (e.g., ion exchange, affinity, particularly by affinity for the specific antigen after Protein A, and sizing column chromatography), centrifugation, differential solubility, or by any other standard technique for the purification of proteins. In addition, the antibodies of the present invention or fragments thereof can be fused to heterologous polypeptide sequences described herein or otherwise known in the art, to facilitate purification.","The present invention encompasses antibodies recombinantly fused or chemically conjugated (including both covalently and non-covalently conjugations) to a polypeptide (or portion thereof, preferably at least 10, 20, 30, 40, 50, 60, 70, 80, 90 or 100 amino acids of the polypeptide) of the present invention to generate fusion proteins. The fusion does not necessarily need to be direct, but may occur through linker sequences. The antibodies may be specific for antigens other than polypeptides (or portion thereof, preferably at least 10, 20, 30, 40, 50, 60, 70, 80, 90 or 100 amino acids of the polypeptide) of the present invention. For example, antibodies may be used to target the polypeptides of the present invention to particular cell types, either in vitro or in vivo, by fusing or conjugating the polypeptides of the present invention to antibodies specific for particular cell surface receptors. Antibodies fused or conjugated to the polypeptides of the present invention may also be used in in vitro immunoassays and purification methods using methods known in the art. See e.g., Harbor et al., supra, and PCT publication WO 93\/21232; EP 439,095; Naramura et al., Immunol. Lett. 39:91-99 (1994); U.S. Pat. No. 5,474,981; Gillies et al., PNAS 89:1428-1432 (1992); Fell et al., J. Immunol. 146:2446-2452 (1991), which are incorporated by reference in their entireties.","The present invention further includes compositions comprising the polypeptides of the present invention fused or conjugated to antibody domains other than the variable regions. For example, the polypeptides of the present invention may be fused or conjugated to an antibody Fc region, or portion thereof. The antibody portion fused to a polypeptide of the present invention may comprise the constant region, hinge region, CH1 domain, CH2 domain, and CH3 domain or any combination of whole domains or portions thereof. The polypeptides may also be fused or conjugated to the above antibody portions to form multimers. For example, Fc portions fused to the polypeptides of the present invention can form dimers through disulfide bonding between the Fc portions. Higher multimeric forms can be made by fusing the polypeptides to portions of IgA and IgM. Methods for fusing or conjugating the polypeptides of the present invention to antibody portions are known in the art. See, e.g., U.S. Pat. Nos. 5,336,603; 5,622,929; 5,359,046; 5,349,053; 5,447,851; 5,112,946; EP 307,434; EP 367,166; PCT publications WO 96\/04388; WO 91\/06570; Ashkenazi et al., Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. USA 88:10535-10539 (1991); Zheng et al., J. Immunol. 154:5590-5600 (1995); and Vil et al., Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. USA 89:11337-11341 (1992) (said references incorporated by reference in their entireties).","As discussed, supra, the polypeptides corresponding to a polypeptide, polypeptide fragment, or a variant of SEQ ID NO:2, 4, 6, 8, 10 and\/or 12 may be fused or conjugated to the above antibody portions to increase the in vivo half life of the polypeptides or for use in immunoassays using methods known in the art. Further, the polypeptides corresponding to SEQ ID NO:2, 4, 6, 8, 10 and\/or 12 may be fused or conjugated to the above antibody portions to facilitate purification. One reported example describes chimeric proteins consisting of the first two domains of the human CD4-polypeptide and various domains of the constant regions of the heavy or light chains of mammalian immunoglobulins. (EP 394,827; Traunecker et al., Nature 331:84-86 (1988). The polypeptides of the present invention fused or conjugated to an antibody having disulfide-linked dimeric structures (due to the IgG) may also be more efficient in binding and neutralizing other molecules, than the monomeric secreted protein or protein fragment alone. (Fountoulakis et al., J. Biochem. 270:3958-3964 (1995)). In many cases, the Fc part in a fusion protein is beneficial in therapy and diagnosis, and thus can result in, for example, improved pharmacokinetic properties. (EP A 232,262). Alternatively, deleting the Fc part after the fusion protein has been expressed, detected, and purified, would be desired. For example, the Fc portion may hinder therapy and diagnosis if the fusion protein is used as an antigen for immunizations. In drug discovery, for example, human proteins, such as hIL-5, have been fused with Fc portions for the purpose of high-throughput screening assays to identify antagonists of hIL-5. (See, Bennett et al., J. Molecular Recognition 8:52-58 (1995); Johanson et al., J. Biol. Chem. 270:9459-9471 (1995).","Moreover, the antibodies or fragments thereof of the present invention can be fused to marker sequences, such as a peptide to facilitate purification. In preferred embodiments, the marker amino acid sequence is a hexa-histidine peptide, such as the tag provided in a pQE vector (QIAGEN, Inc., 9259 Eton Avenue, Chatsworth, Calif., 91311), among others, many of which are commercially available. As described in Gentz et al., Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. USA 86:821-824 (1989), for instance, hexa-histidine provides for convenient purification of the fusion protein. Other peptide tags useful for purification include, but are not limited to, the \u201cHA\u201d tag, which corresponds to an epitope derived from the influenza hemagglutinin protein (Wilson et al., Cell 37:767 (1984)) and the \u201cflag\u201d tag.","The present invention further encompasses antibodies or fragments thereof conjugated to a diagnostic or therapeutic agent. The antibodies can be used diagnostically to, for example, monitor the development or progression of a tumor as part of a clinical testing procedure to, e.g., determine the efficacy of a given treatment regimen. Detection can be facilitated by coupling the antibody to a detectable substance. Examples of detectable substances include various enzymes, prosthetic groups, fluorescent materials, luminescent materials, bioluminescent materials, radioactive materials, positron emitting metals using various positron emission tomographies, and nonradioactive paramagnetic metal ions. The detectable substance may be coupled or conjugated either directly to the antibody (or fragment thereof) or indirectly, through an intermediate (such as, for example, a linker known in the art) using techniques known in the art. See, for example, U.S. Pat. No. 4,741,900 for metal ions which can be conjugated to antibodies for use as diagnostics according to the present invention. Examples of suitable enzymes include horseradish peroxidase, alkaline phosphatase, beta-galactosidase, or acetylcholinesterase; examples of suitable prosthetic group complexes include streptavidin\/biotin and avidin\/biotin; examples of suitable fluorescent materials include umbelliferone, fluorescein, fluorescein isothiocyanate, rhodamine, dichlorotriazinylamine fluorescein, dansyl chloride or phycoerythrin; an example of a luminescent material includes luminol; examples of bioluminescent materials include luciferase, luciferin, and aequorin; and examples of suitable radioactive material include 125I, 131I, 111In or 99Tc.","Further, an antibody or fragment thereof may be conjugated to a therapeutic moiety such as a cytotoxin, e.g., a cytostatic or cytocidal agent, a therapeutic agent or a radioactive metal ion, e.g., alpha-emitters such as, for example, 213Bi. A cytotoxin or cytotoxic agent includes any agent that is detrimental to cells. Examples include paclitaxol, cytochalasin B, gramicidin D, ethidium bromide, emetine, mitomycin, etoposide, tenoposide, vincristine, vinblastine, colchicin, doxorubicin, daunorubicin, dihydroxy anthracin dione, mitoxantrone, mithramycin, actinomycin D, 1-dehydrotestosterone, glucocorticoids, procaine, tetracaine, lidocaine, propranolol, and puromycin and analogs or homologues thereof. Therapeutic agents include, but are not limited to, antimetabolites (e.g., methotrexate, 6-mercaptopurine, 6-thioguanine, cytarabine, 5-fluorouracil decarbazine), alkylating agents (e.g., mechlorethamine, thioepa chlorambucil, melphalan, carmustine (BSNU) and lomustine (CCNU), cyclothosphamide, busulfan, dibromomannitol, streptozotocin, mitomycin C, and cis-dichlorodiamine platinum (II) (DDP) cisplatin), anthracyclines (e.g., daunorubicin (formerly daunomycin) and doxorubicin), antibiotics (e.g., dactinomycin (formerly actinomycin), bleomycin, mithramycin, and anthramycin (AMC)), and anti-mitotic agents (e.g., vincristine and vinblastine).","The conjugates of the invention can be used for modifying a given biological response, the therapeutic agent or drug moiety is not to be construed as limited to classical chemical therapeutic agents. For example, the drug moiety may be a protein or polypeptide possessing a desired biological activity. Such proteins may include, for example, a toxin such as abrin, ricin A, pseudomonas exotoxin, or diphtheria toxin; a protein such as tumor necrosis factor, a-interferon, \u03b2-interferon, nerve growth factor, platelet derived growth factor, tissue plasminogen activator, an apoptotic agent, e.g., TNF-alpha, TNF-beta, AIM I (See, International Publication No. WO 97\/33899), AIM II (See, International Publication No. WO 97\/34911), Fas Ligand (Takahashi et al., Int. Immunol., 6:1567-1574 (1994)), VEGI (See, International Publication No. WO 99\/23105), a thrombotic agent or an anti-angiogenic agent, e.g., angiostatin or endostatin; or, biological response modifiers such as, for example, lymphokines, interleukin-1 (\u201cIL-1\u201d), interleukin-2 (\u201cIL-2\u201d), interleukin-6 (\u201cIL-6\u201d), granulocyte macrophage colony stimulating factor (\u201cGM-CSF\u201d), granulocyte colony stimulating factor (\u201cG-CSF\u201d), or other growth factors.","Antibodies may also be attached to solid supports, which are particularly useful for immunoassays or purification of the target antigen. Such solid supports include, but are not limited to, glass, cellulose, polyacrylamide, nylon, polystyrene, polyvinyl chloride or polypropylene.","Techniques for conjugating such therapeutic moiety to antibodies are well known, see, e.g., Arnon et al., \u201cMonoclonal Antibodies For Immunotargeting Of Drugs In Cancer Therapy\u201d, in Monoclonal Antibodies And Cancer Therapy, Reisfeld et al. (eds.), pp. 243-56 (Alan R. Liss, Inc. 1985); Hellstrom et al., \u201cAntibodies For Drug Delivery\u201d, in Controlled Drug Delivery (2nd Ed.), Robinson et al. (eds.), pp. 623-53 (Marcel Dekker, Inc. 1987); Thorpe, \u201cAntibody Carriers Of Cytotoxic Agents In Cancer Therapy: A Review\u201d, in Monoclonal Antibodies '84: Biological And Clinical Applications, Pinchera et al.

Rev. 62:119-58 (1982).","Alternatively, an antibody can be conjugated to a second antibody to form an antibody heteroconjugate as described by Segal in U.S. Pat. No. 4,676,980, which is incorporated herein by reference in its entirety.","An antibody, with or without a therapeutic moiety conjugated to it, administered alone or in combination with cytotoxic factor(s) and\/or cytokine(s) can be used as a therapeutic.","The present invention also encompasses the creation of synthetic antibodies directed against the polypeptides of the present invention. One example of synthetic antibodies is described in Radrizzani, M., et al., Medicina, (Aires), 59(6):753-8, (1999)). Recently, a new class of synthetic antibodies has been described and are referred to as molecularly imprinted polymers (MIPs) (Semorex, Inc.). Antibodies, peptides, and enzymes are often used as molecular recognition elements in chemical and biological sensors. However, their lack of stability and signal transduction mechanisms limits their use as sensing devices. Molecularly imprinted polymers (MIPs) are capable of mimicking the function of biological receptors but with less stability constraints. Such polymers provide high sensitivity and selectivity while maintaining excellent thermal and mechanical stability. MIPs have the ability to bind to small molecules and to target molecules such as organics and proteins' with equal or greater potency than that of natural antibodies. These \u201csuper\u201d MIPs have higher affinities for their target and thus require lower concentrations for efficacious binding.","During synthesis, the MIPs are imprinted so as to have complementary size, shape, charge and functional groups of the selected target by using the target molecule itself (such as a polypeptide, antibody, etc.), or a substance having a very similar structure, as its \u201cprint\u201d or \u201ctemplate.\u201d MIPs can be derivatized with the same reagents afforded to antibodies. For example, fluorescent \u2018super\u2019 MIPs can be coated onto beads or wells for use in highly sensitive separations or assays, or for use in high throughput screening of proteins.","Moreover, MIPs based upon the structure of the polypeptide(s) of the present invention may be useful in screening for compounds that bind to the polypeptide(s) of the invention. Such a MIP would serve the role of a synthetic \u201creceptor\u201d by minimicking the native architecture of the polypeptide. In fact, the ability of a MIP to serve the role of a synthetic receptor has already been demonstrated for the estrogen receptor (Ye, L., Yu, Y., Mosbach, K, Analyst., 126(6):760-5, (2001); Dickert, F, L., Hayden, O., Halikias, K, P, Analyst., 126(6):766-71, (2001)). A synthetic receptor may either be mimicked in its entirety (e.g., as the entire protein), or mimicked as a series of short peptides corresponding to the protein (Rachkov, A., Minoura, N, Biochim, Biophys, Acta., 1544(1-2):255-66, (2001)). Such a synthetic receptor MIPs may be employed in any one or more of the screening methods described elsewhere herein.","MIPs have also been shown to be useful in \u201csensing\u201d the presence of its mimicked molecule (Cheng, Z., Wang, E., Yang, X, Biosens, Bioelectron., 16(3):179-85, (2001); Jenkins, A, L., Yin, R., Jensen, J. L, Analyst., 126(6):798-802, (2001); Jenkins, A, L., Yin, R., Jensen, J. L, Analyst., 126(6):798-802, (2001)). For example, a MIP designed using a polypeptide of the present invention may be used in assays designed to identify, and potentially quantitate, the level of said polypeptide in a sample. Such a MIP may be used as a substitute for any component described in the assays, or kits, provided herein (e.g., ELISA, etc.).","A number of methods may be employed to create MIPs to a specific receptor, ligand, polypeptide, peptide, organic molecule. Several preferred methods are described by Esteban et al in J. Anal, Chem., 370(7):795-802, (2001), which is hereby incorporated herein by reference in its entirety in addition to any references cited therein. Additional methods are known in the art and are encompassed by the present invention, such as for example, Hart, B, R., Shea, K, J. J. Am. Chem., Soc., 123(9):2072-3, (2001); and Quaglia, M., Chenon, K., Hall, A, J., De, Lorenzi, E., Sellergren, B, J. Am. Chem., Soc., 123(10):2146-54, (2001); which are hereby incorporated by reference in their entirety herein.","The antibodies of the present invention have various utilities. For example, such antibodies may be used in diagnostic assays to detect the presence or quantification of the polypeptides of the invention in a sample. Such a diagnostic assay may be comprised of at least two steps. The first, subjecting a sample with the antibody, wherein the sample is a tissue (e.g., human, animal, etc.), biological fluid (e.g., blood, urine, sputum, semen, amniotic fluid, saliva, etc.), biological extract (e.g., tissue or cellular homogenate, etc.), a protein microchip (e.g., See Arenkov P, et al., Anal Biochem., 278(2):123-131 (2000)), or a chromatography column, etc. And a second step involving the quantification of antibody bound to the substrate. Alternatively, the method may additionally involve a first step of attaching the antibody, either covalently, electrostatically, or reversibly, to a solid support, and a second step of subjecting the bound antibody to the sample, as defined above and elsewhere herein.","Various diagnostic assay techniques are known in the art, such as competitive binding assays, direct or indirect sandwich assays and immunoprecipitation assays conducted in either heterogeneous or homogenous phases (Zola, Monoclonal Antibodies: A Manual of Techniques, CRC Press, Inc., (1987), pp 147-158). The antibodies used in the diagnostic assays can be labeled with a detectable moiety. The detectable moiety should be capable of producing, either directly or indirectly, a detectable signal. For example, the detectable moiety may be a radioisotope, such as 2H, 14C, 32P, or 125I, a florescent or chemiluminescent compound, such as fluorescein isothiocyanate, rhodamine, or luciferin, or an enzyme, such as alkaline phosphatase, beta-galactosidase, green fluorescent protein, or horseradish peroxidase. Any method known in the art for conjugating the antibody to the detectable moiety may be employed, including those methods described by Hunter et al., Nature, 144:945 (1962); Dafvid et al., Biochem., 13:1014 (1974); Pain et al., J. Immunol. Metho., 40:219 (1981); and Nygren, J. Histochem. And Cytochem., 30:407 (1982).","Antibodies directed against the polypeptides of the present invention are useful for the affinity purification of such polypeptides from recombinant cell culture or natural sources. In this process, the antibodies against a particular polypeptide are immobilized on a suitable support, such as a Sephadex resin or filter paper, using methods well known in the art. The immobilized antibody then is contacted with a sample containing the polypeptides to be purified, and thereafter the support is washed with a suitable solvent that will remove substantially all the material in the sample except for the desired polypeptides, which are bound to the immobilized antibody. Finally, the support is washed with another suitable solvent that will release the desired polypeptide from the antibody.","The antibodies of the invention may be utilized for immunophenotyping of cell lines and biological samples. The translation product of the gene of the present invention may be useful as a cell specific marker, or more specifically as a cellular marker that is differentially expressed at various stages of differentiation and\/or maturation of particular cell types. Monoclonal antibodies directed against a specific epitope, or combination of epitopes, will allow for the screening of cellular populations expressing the marker. Various techniques can be utilized using monoclonal antibodies to screen for cellular populations expressing the marker(s), and include magnetic separation using antibody-coated magnetic beads, \u201cpanning\u201d with antibody attached to a solid matrix (i.e., plate), and flow cytometry (See, e.g., U.S. Pat. No. 5,985,660; and Morrison et al., Cell, 96:737-49 (1999)).","These techniques allow for the screening of particular populations of cells, such as might be found with hematological malignancies (i.e. minimal residual disease (MRD) in acute leukemic patients) and \u201cnon-self\u201d cells in transplantations to prevent Graft-versus-Host Disease (GVHD). Alternatively, these techniques allow for the screening of hematopoietic stem and progenitor cells capable of undergoing proliferation and\/or differentiation, as might be found in human umbilical cord blood.","The antibodies of the invention may be assayed for immunospecific binding by any method known in the art. The immunoassays which can be used include but are not limited to competitive and non-competitive assay systems using techniques such as western blots, radioimmunoassays, ELISA (enzyme linked immunosorbent assay), \u201csandwich\u201d immunoassays, immunoprecipitation assays, precipitin reactions, gel diffusion precipitin reactions, immunodiffusion assays, agglutination assays, complement-fixation assays, immunoradiometric assays, fluorescent immunoassays, protein A immunoassays, to name but a few. Such assays are routine and well known in the art (see, e.g., Ausubel et al, eds, 1994, Current Protocols in Molecular Biology, Vol. 1, John Wiley & Sons, Inc., New York, which is incorporated by reference herein in its entirety). Exemplary immunoassays are described briefly below (but are not intended by way of limitation).","Immunoprecipitation protocols generally comprise lysing a population of cells in a lysis buffer such as RIPA buffer (1% NP-40 or Triton X-100, 1% sodium deoxycholate, 0.1% SDS, 0.15 M NaCl, 0.01 M sodium phosphate at pH 7.2, 1% Trasylol) supplemented with protein phosphatase and\/or protease inhibitors (e.g., EDTA, PMSF, aprotinin, sodium vanadate), adding the antibody of interest to the cell lysate, incubating for a period of time (e.g., 1-4 hours) at 4\u00b0 C., adding protein A and\/or protein G sepharose beads to the cell lysate, incubating for about an hour or more at 4\u00b0 C., washing the beads in lysis buffer and resuspending the beads in SDS\/sample buffer. The ability of the antibody of interest to immunoprecipitate a particular antigen can be assessed by, e.g., western blot analysis. One of skill in the art would be knowledgeable as to the parameters that can be modified to increase the binding of the antibody to an antigen and decrease the background (e.g., pre-clearing the cell lysate with sepharose beads). For further discussion regarding immunoprecipitation protocols see, e.g., Ausubel et al, eds, 1994, Current Protocols in Molecular Biology, Vol. 1, John Wiley & Sons, Inc., New York at 10.16.1.","Western blot analysis generally comprises preparing protein samples, electrophoresis of the protein samples in a polyacrylamide gel (e.g., 8%-20% SDS-PAGE depending on the molecular weight of the antigen), transferring the protein sample from the polyacrylamide gel to a membrane such as nitrocellulose, PVDF or nylon, blocking the membrane in blocking solution (e.g., PBS with 3% BSA or non-fat milk), washing the membrane in washing buffer (e.g., PBS-Tween 20), blocking the membrane with primary antibody (the antibody of interest) diluted in blocking buffer, washing the membrane in washing buffer, blocking the membrane with a secondary antibody (which recognizes the primary antibody, e.g., an anti-human antibody) conjugated to an enzymatic substrate (e.g., horseradish peroxidase or alkaline phosphatase) or radioactive molecule (e.g., 32P or 125I) diluted in blocking buffer, washing the membrane in wash buffer, and detecting the presence of the antigen. One of skill in the art would be knowledgeable as to the parameters that can be modified to increase the signal detected and to reduce the background noise. For further discussion regarding western blot protocols see, e.g., Ausubel et al, eds, 1994, Current Protocols in Molecular Biology, Vol. 1, John Wiley & Sons, Inc., New York at 10.8.1.","ELISAs comprise preparing antigen, coating the well of a 96 well microtiter plate with the antigen, adding the antibody of interest conjugated to a detectable compound such as an enzymatic substrate (e.g., horseradish peroxidase or alkaline phosphatase) to the well and incubating for a period of time, and detecting the presence of the antigen. In ELISAs the antibody of interest does not have to be conjugated to a detectable compound; instead, a second antibody (which recognizes the antibody of interest) conjugated to a detectable compound may be added to the well. Further, instead of coating the well with the antigen, the antibody may be coated to the well. In this case, a second antibody conjugated to a detectable compound may be added following the addition of the antigen of interest to the coated well. One of skill in the art would be knowledgeable as to the parameters that can be modified to increase the signal detected as well as other variations of ELISAs known in the art. For further discussion regarding ELISAs see, e.g., Ausubel et al, eds, 1994, Current Protocols in Molecular Biology, Vol. 1, John Wiley & Sons, Inc., New York at 11.2.1.","The binding affinity of an antibody to an antigen and the off-rate of an antibody-antigen interaction can be determined by competitive binding assays. One example of a competitive binding assay is a radioimmunoassay comprising the incubation of labeled antigen (e.g., 3H or 125I) with the antibody of interest in the presence of increasing amounts of unlabeled antigen, and the detection of the antibody bound to the labeled antigen. The affinity of the antibody of interest for a particular antigen and the binding off-rates can be determined from the data by scatchard plot analysis. Competition with a second antibody can also be determined using radioimmunoassays. In this case, the antigen is incubated with antibody of interest conjugated to a labeled compound (e.g., 3H or 125I) in the presence of increasing amounts of an unlabeled second antibody.","The present invention is further directed to antibody-based therapies which involve administering antibodies of the invention to an animal, preferably a mammal, and most preferably a human, patient for treating one or more of the disclosed diseases, disorders, or conditions. Therapeutic compounds of the invention include, but are not limited to, antibodies of the invention (including fragments, analogs and derivatives thereof as described herein) and nucleic acids encoding antibodies of the invention (including fragments, analogs and derivatives thereof and anti-idiotypic antibodies as described herein). The antibodies of the invention can be used to treat, inhibit or prevent diseases, disorders or conditions associated with aberrant expression and\/or activity of a polypeptide of the invention, including, but not limited to, any one or more of the diseases, disorders, or conditions described herein. The treatment and\/or prevention of diseases, disorders, or conditions associated with aberrant expression and\/or activity of a polypeptide of the invention includes, but is not limited to, alleviating symptoms associated with those diseases, disorders or conditions. Antibodies of the invention may be provided in pharmaceutically acceptable compositions as known in the art or as described herein.","A summary of the ways in which the antibodies of the present invention may be used therapeutically includes binding polynucleotides or polypeptides of the present invention locally or systemically in the body or by direct cytotoxicity of the antibody, e.g. as mediated by complement (CDC) or by effector cells (ADCC). Some of these approaches are described in more detail below. Armed with the teachings provided herein, one of ordinary skill in the art will know how to use the antibodies of the present invention for diagnostic, monitoring or therapeutic purposes without undue experimentation.","The antibodies of this invention may be advantageously utilized in combination with other monoclonal or chimeric antibodies, or with lymphokines or hematopoietic growth factors (such as, e.g., IL-2, IL-3 and IL-7), for example, which serve to increase the number or activity of effector cells which interact with the antibodies.","The antibodies of the invention may be administered alone or in combination with other types of treatments (e.g., radiation therapy, chemotherapy, hormonal therapy, immunotherapy and anti-tumor agents). Generally, administration of products of a species origin or species reactivity (in the case of antibodies) that is the same species as that of the patient is preferred. Thus, in a preferred embodiment, human antibodies, fragments derivatives, analogs, or nucleic acids, are administered to a human patient for therapy or prophylaxis.","It is preferred to use high affinity and\/or potent in vivo inhibiting and\/or neutralizing antibodies against polypeptides or polynucleotides of the present invention, fragments or regions thereof, for both immunoassays directed to and therapy of disorders related to polynucleotides or polypeptides, including fragments thereof, of the present invention. Such antibodies, fragments, or regions, will preferably have an affinity for polynucleotides or polypeptides of the invention, including fragments thereof. Preferred binding affinities include those with a dissociation constant or Kd less than 5\u00d710\u22122 M, 10\u22122 M, 5\u00d710\u22123 M, 10\u22123 M, 5\u00d710\u22124 M, 10\u22124 M, 5\u00d710\u22125 M, 10\u22125 M, 5\u00d710\u22126 M, 10\u22126 M, 5\u00d710\u22127 M, 10\u22127 M, 5\u00d710\u22128 M, 10\u22128 M, 5\u00d710\u22129 M, 10\u22129 M, 5\u00d710\u221210 M, 10\u221210 M, 5\u00d710\u221211 M, 10\u221211 M, 5\u00d710\u221212 M, 10\u221212 M, 5\u00d710\u221213 M, 10\u221213 M, 5\u00d710\u221214 M, 10\u221214 M, 5\u00d710\u221215 M, and 10\u221215 M.","Antibodies directed against polypeptides of the present invention are useful for inhibiting allergic reactions in animals. For example, by administering a therapeutically acceptable dose of an antibody, or antibodies, of the present invention, or a cocktail of the present antibodies, or in combination with other antibodies of varying sources, the animal may not elicit an allergic response to antigens.","Likewise, one could envision cloning the gene encoding an antibody directed against a polypeptide of the present invention, said polypeptide having the potential to elicit an allergic and\/or immune response in an organism, and transforming the organism with said antibody gene such that it is expressed (e.g., constitutively, inducibly, etc.) in the organism. Thus, the organism would effectively become resistant to an allergic response resulting from the ingestion or presence of such an immune\/allergic reactive polypeptide. Moreover, such a use of the antibodies of the present invention may have particular utility in preventing and\/or ameliorating autoimmune diseases and\/or disorders, as such conditions are typically a result of antibodies being directed against endogenous proteins. For example, in the instance where the polypeptide of the present invention is responsible for modulating the immune response to auto-antigens, transforming the organism and\/or individual with a construct comprising any of the promoters disclosed herein or otherwise known in the art, in addition, to a polynucleotide encoding the antibody directed against the polypeptide of the present invention could effective inhibit the organisms immune system from eliciting an immune response to the auto-antigen(s). Detailed descriptions of therapeutic and\/or gene therapy applications of the present invention are provided elsewhere herein.","Alternatively, antibodies of the present invention could be produced in a plant (e.g., cloning the gene of the antibody directed against a polypeptide of the present invention, and transforming a plant with a suitable vector comprising said gene for constitutive expression of the antibody within the plant), and the plant subsequently ingested by an animal, thereby conferring temporary immunity to the animal for the specific antigen the antibody is directed towards (See, for example, U.S. Pat. Nos. 5,914,123 and 6,034,298).","In another embodiment, antibodies of the present invention, preferably polyclonal antibodies, more preferably monoclonal antibodies, and most preferably single-chain antibodies, can be used as a means of inhibiting gene expression of a particular gene, or genes, in a human, mammal, and\/or other organism. See, for example, International Publication Number WO 00\/05391, published Feb. 3, 2000, to Dow Agrosciences LLC. The application of such methods for the antibodies of the present invention are known in the art, and are more particularly described elsewhere herein.","In yet another embodiment, antibodies of the present invention may be useful for multimerizing the polypeptides of the present invention. For example, certain proteins may confer enhanced biological activity when present in a multimeric state (i.e., such enhanced activity may be due to the increased effective concentration of such proteins whereby more protein is available in a localized location).","In a specific embodiment, nucleic acids comprising sequences encoding antibodies or functional derivatives thereof, are administered to treat, inhibit or prevent a disease or disorder associated with aberrant expression and\/or activity of a polypeptide of the invention, by way of gene therapy. Gene therapy refers to therapy performed by the administration to a subject of an expressed or expressible nucleic acid. In this embodiment of the invention, the nucleic acids produce their encoded protein that mediates a therapeutic effect.","Any of the methods for gene therapy available in the art can be used according to the present invention. Exemplary methods are described below.","For general reviews of the methods of gene therapy, see Goldspiel et al., Clinical Pharmacy 12:488-505 (1993); Wu and Wu, Biotherapy 3:87-95 (1991); Tolstoshev, Ann. Rev. Pharmacol. Toxicol. 32:573-596 (1993); Mulligan, Science 260:926-932 (1993); and Morgan and Anderson, Ann. Rev. Biochem. 62:191-217 (1993); May, TIBTECH 11(5):155-215 (1993). Methods commonly known in the art of recombinant DNA technology which can be used are described in Ausubel et al. (eds.), Current Protocols in Molecular Biology, John Wiley & Sons, N.Y. (1993); and Kriegler, Gene Transfer and Expression, A Laboratory Manual, Stockton Press, N.Y. (1990).","In a preferred aspect, the compound comprises nucleic acid sequences encoding an antibody, said nucleic acid sequences being part of expression vectors that express the antibody or fragments or chimeric proteins or heavy or light chains thereof in a suitable host. In particular, such nucleic acid sequences have promoters operably linked to the antibody coding region, said promoter being inducible or constitutive, and, optionally, tissue-specific. In another particular embodiment, nucleic acid molecules are used in which the antibody coding sequences and any other desired sequences are flanked by regions that promote homologous recombination at a desired site in the genome, thus providing for intrachromosomal expression of the antibody encoding nucleic acids (Koller and Smithies, Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. USA 86:8932-8935 (1989); Zijlstra et al., Nature 342:435-438 (1989). In specific embodiments, the expressed antibody molecule is a single chain antibody; alternatively, the nucleic acid sequences include sequences encoding both the heavy and light chains, or fragments thereof, of the antibody.","Delivery of the nucleic acids into a patient may be either direct, in which case the patient is directly exposed to the nucleic acid or nucleic acid-carrying vectors, or indirect, in which case, cells are first transformed with the nucleic acids in vitro, then transplanted into the patient. These two approaches are known, respectively, as in vivo or ex vivo gene therapy.","In a specific embodiment, the nucleic acid sequences are directly administered in vivo, where it is expressed to produce the encoded product. This can be accomplished by any of numerous methods known in the art, e.g., by constructing them as part of an appropriate nucleic acid expression vector and administering it so that they become intracellular, e.g., by infection using defective or attenuated retrovirals or other viral vectors (see U.S. Pat. No. 4,980,286), or by direct injection of naked DNA, or by use of microparticle bombardment (e.g., a gene gun; Biolistic, Dupont), or coating with lipids or cell-surface receptors or transfecting agents, encapsulation in liposomes, microparticles, or microcapsules, or by administering them in linkage to a peptide which is known to enter the nucleus, by administering it in linkage to a ligand subject to receptor-mediated endocytosis (see, e.g., Wu and Wu, J. Biol. Chem. 262:4429-4432 (1987)) (which can be used to target cell types specifically expressing the receptors), etc. In another embodiment, nucleic acid-ligand complexes can be formed in which the ligand comprises a fusogenic viral peptide to disrupt endosomes, allowing the nucleic acid to avoid lysosomal degradation. In yet another embodiment, the nucleic acid can be targeted in vivo for cell specific uptake and expression, by targeting a specific receptor (see, e.g., PCT Publications WO 92\/06180; WO 92\/22635; WO92\/20316; WO93\/14188, WO 93\/20221). Alternatively, the nucleic acid can be introduced intracellularly and incorporated within host cell DNA for expression, by homologous recombination (Koller and Smithies, Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. USA 86:8932-8935 (1989); Zijlstra et al., Nature 342:435-438 (1989)).","In a specific embodiment, viral vectors that contains nucleic acid sequences encoding an antibody of the invention are used. For example, a retroviral vector can be used (see Miller et al., Meth. Enzymol. 217:581-599 (1993)). These retroviral vectors contain the components necessary for the correct packaging of the viral genome and integration into the host cell DNA. The nucleic acid sequences encoding the antibody to be used in gene therapy are cloned into one or more vectors, which facilitates delivery of the gene into a patient. More detail about retroviral vectors can be found in Boesen et al., Biotherapy 6:291-302 (1994), which describes the use of a retroviral vector to deliver the mdr1 gene to hematopoietic stem cells in order to make the stem cells more resistant to chemotherapy.

Opin. in Genetics and Devel. 3:110-114 (1993).","Adenoviruses are other viral vectors that can be used in gene therapy. Adenoviruses are especially attractive vehicles for delivering genes to respiratory epithelia. Adenoviruses naturally infect respiratory epithelia where they cause a mild disease. Other targets for adenovirus-based delivery systems are liver, the central nervous system, endothelial cells, and muscle. Adenoviruses have the advantage of being capable of infecting non-dividing cells. Kozarsky and Wilson, Current Opinion in Genetics and Development 3:499-503 (1993) present a review of adenovirus-based gene therapy. Bout et al., Human Gene Therapy 5:3-10 (1994) demonstrated the use of adenovirus vectors to transfer genes to the respiratory epithelia of rhesus monkeys. Other instances of the use of adenoviruses in gene therapy can be found in Rosenfeld et al., Science 252:431-434 (1991); Rosenfeld et al., Cell 68:143-155 (1992); Mastrangeli et al., J. Clin. Invest. 91:225-234 (1993); PCT Publication WO94\/12649; and Wang, et al., Gene Therapy 2:775-783 (1995). In a preferred embodiment, adenovirus vectors are used.","Adeno-associated virus (AAV) has also been proposed for use in gene therapy (Walsh et al., Proc. Soc. Exp. Biol. Med. 204:289-300 (1993); U.S. Pat. No. 5,436,146).","Another approach to gene therapy involves transferring a gene to cells in tissue culture by such methods as electroporation, lipofection, calcium phosphate mediated transfection, or viral infection. Usually, the method of transfer includes the transfer of a selectable marker to the cells. The cells are then placed under selection to isolate those cells that have taken up and are expressing the transferred gene. Those cells are then delivered to a patient.","In this embodiment, the nucleic acid is introduced into a cell prior to administration in vivo of the resulting recombinant cell. Such introduction can be carried out by any method known in the art, including but not limited to transfection, electroporation, microinjection, infection with a viral or bacteriophage vector containing the nucleic acid sequences, cell fusion, chromosome-mediated gene transfer, microcell-mediated gene transfer, spheroplast fusion, etc. Numerous techniques are known in the art for the introduction of foreign genes into cells (see, e.g., Loeffler and Behr, Meth. Enzymol. 217:599-618 (1993); Cohen et al., Meth. Enzymol. 217:618-644 (1993); Cline, Pharmac. Ther. 29:69-92m (1985) and may be used in accordance with the present invention, provided that the necessary developmental and physiological functions of the recipient cells are not disrupted. The technique should provide for the stable transfer of the nucleic acid to the cell, so that the nucleic acid is expressible by the cell and preferably heritable and expressible by its cell progeny.","The resulting recombinant cells can be delivered to a patient by various methods known in the art. Recombinant blood cells (e.g., hematopoietic stem or progenitor cells) are preferably administered intravenously. The amount of cells envisioned for use depends on the desired effect, patient state, etc., and can be determined by one skilled in the art.","Cells into which a nucleic acid can be introduced for purposes of gene therapy encompass any desired, available cell type, and include but are not limited to epithelial cells, endothelial cells, keratinocytes, fibroblasts, muscle cells, hepatocytes; blood cells such as Tlymphocytes, Blymphocytes, monocytes, macrophages, neutrophils, eosinophils, megakaryocytes, granulocytes; various stem or progenitor cells, in particular hematopoietic stem or progenitor cells, e.g., as obtained from bone marrow, umbilical cord blood, peripheral blood, fetal liver, etc.","In a preferred embodiment, the cell used for gene therapy is autologous to the patient.","In an embodiment in which recombinant cells are used in gene therapy, nucleic acid sequences encoding an antibody are introduced into the cells such that they are expressible by the cells or their progeny, and the recombinant cells are then administered in vivo for therapeutic effect. In a specific embodiment, stem or progenitor cells are used. Any stem and\/or progenitor cells which can be isolated and maintained in vitro can potentially be used in accordance with this embodiment of the present invention (see e.g. PCT Publication WO 94\/08598; Stemple and Anderson, Cell 71:973-985 (1992); Rheinwald, Meth. Cell Bio. 21A:229 (1980); and Pittelkow and Scott, Mayo Clinic Proc. 61:771 (1986)).","In a specific embodiment, the nucleic acid to be introduced for purposes of gene therapy comprises an inducible promoter operably linked to the coding region, such that expression of the nucleic acid is controllable by controlling the presence or absence of the appropriate inducer of transcription. Demonstration of Therapeutic or Prophylactic Activity","The compounds or pharmaceutical compositions of the invention are preferably tested in vitro, and then in vivo for the desired therapeutic or prophylactic activity, prior to use in humans. For example, in vitro assays to demonstrate the therapeutic or prophylactic utility of a compound or pharmaceutical composition include, the effect of a compound on a cell line or a patient tissue sample. The effect of the compound or composition on the cell line and\/or tissue sample can be determined utilizing techniques known to those of skill in the art including, but not limited to, rosette formation assays and cell lysis assays. In accordance with the invention, in vitro assays which can be used to determine whether administration of a specific compound is indicated, include in vitro cell culture assays in which a patient tissue sample is grown in culture, and exposed to or otherwise administered a compound, and the effect of such compound upon the tissue sample is observed.","The invention provides methods of treatment, inhibition and prophylaxis by administration to a subject of an effective amount of a compound or pharmaceutical composition of the invention, preferably an antibody of the invention. In a preferred aspect, the compound is substantially purified (e.g., substantially free from substances that limit its effect or produce undesired side-effects). The subject is preferably an animal, including but not limited to animals such as cows, pigs, horses, chickens, cats, dogs, etc., and is preferably a mammal, and most preferably human.","Formulations and methods of administration that can be employed when the compound comprises a nucleic acid or an immunoglobulin are described above; additional appropriate formulations and routes of administration can be selected from among those described herein below.","Various delivery systems are known and can be used to administer a compound of the invention, e.g., encapsulation in liposomes, microparticles, microcapsules, recombinant cells capable of expressing the compound, receptor-mediated endocytosis (see, e.g., Wu and Wu, J. Biol. Chem . . . 262:4429-4432 (1987)), construction of a nucleic acid as part of a retroviral or other vector, etc. Methods of introduction include but are not limited to intradermal, intramuscular, intraperitoneal, intravenous, subcutaneous, intranasal, epidural, and oral routes. The compounds or compositions may be administered by any convenient route, for example by infusion or bolus injection, by absorption through epithelial or mucocutaneous linings (e.g., oral mucosa, rectal and intestinal mucosa, etc.) and may be administered together with other biologically active agents. Administration can be systemic or local. In addition, it may be desirable to introduce the pharmaceutical compounds or compositions of the invention into the central nervous system by any suitable route, including intraventricular and intrathecal injection; intraventricular injection may be facilitated by an intraventricular catheter, for example, attached to a reservoir, such as an Ommaya reservoir. Pulmonary administration can also be employed, e.g., by use of an inhaler or nebulizer, and formulation with an aerosolizing agent.","In a specific embodiment, it may be desirable to administer the pharmaceutical compounds or compositions of the invention locally to the area in need of treatment; this may be achieved by, for example, and not by way of limitation, local infusion during surgery, topical application, e.g., in conjunction with a wound dressing after surgery, by injection, by means of a catheter, by means of a suppository, or by means of an implant, said implant being of a porous, non-porous, or gelatinous material, including membranes, such as sialastic membranes, or fibers. Preferably, when administering a protein, including an antibody, of the invention, care must be taken to use materials to which the protein does not absorb.","In another embodiment, the compound or composition can be delivered in a vesicle, in particular a liposome (see Langer, Science 249:1527-1533 (1990); Treat et al., in Liposomes in the Therapy of Infectious Disease and Cancer, Lopez-Berestein and Fidler (eds.), Liss, New York, pp. 353-365 (1989); Lopez-Berestein, ibid., pp. 317-327; see generally ibid.)","In yet another embodiment, the compound or composition can be delivered in a controlled release system. In one embodiment, a pump may be used (see Langer, supra; Sefton, CRC Crit. Ref. Biomed. Eng. 14:201 (1987); Buchwald et al., Surgery 88:507 (1980); Saudek et al., N. Engl. J. Med. 321:574 (1989)). In another embodiment, polymeric materials can be used (see Medical Applications of Controlled Release, Langer and Wise (eds.), CRC Pres., Boca Raton, Fla. (1974); Controlled Drug Bioavailability, Drug Product Design and Performance, Smolen and Ball (eds.), Wiley, New York (1984); Ranger and Peppas, J., Macromol. Sci. Rev. Macromol. Chem. 23:61 (1983); see also Levy et al., Science 228:190 (1985); During et al., Ann. Neurol. 25:351 (1989); Howard et al., J. Neurosurg. 71:105 (1989)). In yet another embodiment, a controlled release system can be placed in proximity of the therapeutic target, i.e., the brain, thus requiring only a fraction of the systemic dose (see, e.g., Goodson, in Medical Applications of Controlled Release, supra, vol. 2, pp. 115-138 (1984)).","Other controlled release systems are discussed in the review by Langer (Science 249:1527-1533 (1990)).","In a specific embodiment where the compound of the invention is a nucleic acid encoding a protein, the nucleic acid can be administered in vivo to promote expression of its encoded protein, by constructing it as part of an appropriate nucleic acid expression vector and administering it so that it becomes intracellular, e.g., by use of a retroviral vector (see U.S. Pat. No. 4,980,286), or by direct injection, or by use of microparticle bombardment (e.g., a gene gun; Biolistic, Dupont), or coating with lipids or cell-surface receptors or transfecting agents, or by administering it in linkage to a homeobox-like peptide which is known to enter the nucleus (see e.g., Joliot et al., Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. USA 88:1864-1868 (1991)), etc. Alternatively, a nucleic acid can be introduced intracellularly and incorporated within host cell DNA for expression, by homologous recombination.","The present invention also provides pharmaceutical compositions. Such compositions comprise a therapeutically effective amount of a compound, and a pharmaceutically acceptable carrier. In a specific embodiment, the term \u201cpharmaceutically acceptable\u201d means approved by a regulatory agency of the Federal or a state government or listed in the U.S. Pharmacopeia or other generally recognized pharmacopeia for use in animals, and more particularly in humans. The term \u201ccarrier\u201d refers to a diluent, adjuvant, excipient, or vehicle with which the therapeutic is administered. Such pharmaceutical carriers can be sterile liquids, such as water and oils, including those of petroleum, animal, vegetable or synthetic origin, such as peanut oil, soybean oil, mineral oil, sesame oil and the like. Water is a preferred carrier when the pharmaceutical composition is administered intravenously. Saline solutions and aqueous dextrose and glycerol solutions can also be employed as liquid carriers, particularly for injectable solutions. Suitable pharmaceutical excipients include starch, glucose, lactose, sucrose, gelatin, malt, rice, flour, chalk, silica gel, sodium stearate, glycerol monostearate, talc, sodium chloride, dried skim milk, glycerol, propylene, glycol, water, ethanol and the like. The composition, if desired, can also contain minor amounts of wetting or emulsifying agents, or pH buffering agents. These compositions can take the form of solutions, suspensions, emulsion, tablets, pills, capsules, powders, sustained-release formulations and the like. The composition can be formulated as a suppository, with traditional binders and carriers such as triglycerides. Oral formulation can include standard carriers such as pharmaceutical grades of mannitol, lactose, starch, magnesium stearate, sodium saccharine, cellulose, magnesium carbonate, etc. Examples of suitable pharmaceutical carriers are described in \u201cRemington's Pharmaceutical Sciences\u201d by E. W. Martin. Such compositions will contain a therapeutically effective amount of the compound, preferably in purified form, together with a suitable amount of carrier so as to provide the form for proper administration to the patient. The formulation should suit the mode of administration.","In a preferred embodiment, the composition is formulated in accordance with routine procedures as a pharmaceutical composition adapted for intravenous administration to human beings. Typically, compositions for intravenous administration are solutions in sterile isotonic aqueous buffer. Where necessary, the composition may also include a solubilizing agent and a local anesthetic such as lignocaine to ease pain at the site of the injection. Generally, the ingredients are supplied either separately or mixed together in unit dosage form, for example, as a dry lyophilized powder or water free concentrate in a hermetically sealed container such as an ampoule or sachette indicating the quantity of active agent. Where the composition is to be administered by infusion, it can be dispensed with an infusion bottle containing sterile pharmaceutical grade water or saline. Where the composition is administered by injection, an ampoule of sterile water for injection or saline can be provided so that the ingredients may be mixed prior to administration.","The compounds of the invention can be formulated as neutral or salt forms. Pharmaceutically acceptable salts include those formed with anions such as those derived from hydrochloric, phosphoric, acetic, oxalic, tartaric acids, etc., and those formed with cations such as those derived from sodium, potassium, ammonium, calcium, ferric hydroxides, isopropylamine, triethylamine, 2-ethylamino ethanol, histidine, procaine, etc.","The amount of the compound of the invention which will be effective in the treatment, inhibition and prevention of a disease or disorder associated with aberrant expression and\/or activity of a polypeptide of the invention can be determined by standard clinical techniques. In addition, in vitro assays may optionally be employed to help identify optimal dosage ranges. The precise dose to be employed in the formulation will also depend on the route of administration, and the seriousness of the disease or disorder, and should be decided according to the judgment of the practitioner and each patient's circumstances. Effective doses may be extrapolated from dose-response curves derived from in vitro or animal model test systems.","For antibodies, the dosage administered to a patient is typically 0.1 mg\/kg to 100 mg\/kg of the patient's body weight. Preferably, the dosage administered to a patient is between 0.1 mg\/kg and 20 mg\/kg of the patient's body weight, more preferably 1 mg\/kg to 10 mg\/kg of the patient's body weight. Generally, human antibodies have a longer half-life within the human body than antibodies from other species due to the immune response to the foreign polypeptides. Thus, lower dosages of human antibodies and less frequent administration is often possible. Further, the dosage and frequency of administration of antibodies of the invention may be reduced by enhancing uptake and tissue penetration (e.g., into the brain) of the antibodies by modifications such as, for example, lipidation.","The invention also provides a pharmaceutical pack or kit comprising one or more containers filled with one or more of the ingredients of the pharmaceutical compositions of the invention. Optionally associated with such container(s) can be a notice in the form prescribed by a governmental agency regulating the manufacture, use or sale of pharmaceuticals or biological products, which notice reflects approval by the agency of manufacture, use or sale for human administration.","Labeled antibodies, and derivatives and analogs thereof, which specifically bind to a polypeptide of interest can be used for diagnostic purposes to detect, diagnose, or monitor diseases, disorders, and\/or conditions associated with the aberrant expression and\/or activity of a polypeptide of the invention. The invention provides for the detection of aberrant expression of a polypeptide of interest, comprising (a) assaying the expression of the polypeptide of interest in cells or body fluid of an individual using one or more antibodies specific to the polypeptide interest and (b) comparing the level of gene expression with a standard gene expression level, whereby an increase or decrease in the assayed polypeptide gene expression level compared to the standard expression level is indicative of aberrant expression.","The invention provides a diagnostic assay for diagnosing a disorder, comprising (a) assaying the expression of the polypeptide of interest in cells or body fluid of an individual using one or more antibodies specific to the polypeptide interest and (b) comparing the level of gene expression with a standard gene expression level, whereby an increase or decrease in the assayed polypeptide gene expression level compared to the standard expression level is indicative of a particular disorder. With respect to cancer, the presence of a relatively high amount of transcript in biopsied tissue from an individual may indicate a predisposition for the development of the disease, or may provide a means for detecting the disease prior to the appearance of actual clinical symptoms. A more definitive diagnosis of this type may allow health professionals to employ preventative measures or aggressive treatment earlier thereby preventing the development or further progression of the cancer.","Antibodies of the invention can be used to assay protein levels in a biological sample using classical immunohistological methods known to those of skill in the art (e.g., see Jalkanen, et al., J. Cell. Biol. 101:976-985 (1985); Jalkanen, et al., J. Cell. Biol. 105:3087-3096 (1987)). Other antibody-based methods useful for detecting protein gene expression include immunoassays, such as the enzyme linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA) and the radioimmunoassay (RIA). Suitable antibody assay labels are known in the art and include enzyme labels, such as, glucose oxidase; radioisotopes, such as iodine (125I, 121I), carbon (14C), sulfur (35S), tritium (3H), indium (112In), and technetium (99Tc); luminescent labels, such as luminol; and fluorescent labels, such as fluorescein and rhodamine, and biotin.","One aspect of the invention is the detection and diagnosis of a disease or disorder associated with aberrant expression of a polypeptide of interest in an animal, preferably a mammal and most preferably a human. In one embodiment, diagnosis comprises: a) administering (for example, parenterally, subcutaneously, or intraperitoneally) to a subject an effective amount of a labeled molecule which specifically binds to the polypeptide of interest; b) waiting for a time interval following the administering for permitting the labeled molecule to preferentially concentrate at sites in the subject where the polypeptide is expressed (and for unbound labeled molecule to be cleared to background level); c) determining background level; and d) detecting the labeled molecule in the subject, such that detection of labeled molecule above the background level indicates that the subject has a particular disease or disorder associated with aberrant expression of the polypeptide of interest. Background level can be determined by various methods including, comparing the amount of labeled molecule detected to a standard value previously determined for a particular system.","It will be understood in the art that the size of the subject and the imaging system used will determine the quantity of imaging moiety needed to produce diagnostic images. In the case of a radioisotope moiety, for a human subject, the quantity of radioactivity injected will normally range from about 5 to 20 millicuries of 99mTc. The labeled antibody or antibody fragment will then preferentially accumulate at the location of cells which contain the specific protein. In vivo tumor imaging is described in S. W. Burchiel et al., \u201cImmunopharmacokinetics of Radiolabeled Antibodies and Their Fragments.\u201d (Chapter 13 in Tumor Imaging: The Radiochemical Detection of Cancer, S. W. Burchiel and B. A. Rhodes, eds., Masson Publishing Inc. (1982).","Depending on several variables, including the type of label used and the mode of administration, the time interval following the administration for permitting the labeled molecule to preferentially concentrate at sites in the subject and for unbound labeled molecule to be cleared to background level is 6 to 48 hours or 6 to 24 hours or 6 to 12 hours. In another embodiment the time interval following administration is 5 to 20 days or 5 to 10 days.","In an embodiment, monitoring of the disease or disorder is carried out by repeating the method for diagnosing the disease or disease, for example, one month after initial diagnosis, six months after initial diagnosis, one year after initial diagnosis, etc.","Presence of the labeled molecule can be detected in the patient using methods known in the art for in vivo scanning. These methods depend upon the type of label used. Skilled artisans will be able to determine the appropriate method for detecting a particular label. Methods and devices that may be used in the diagnostic methods of the invention include, but are not limited to, computed tomography (CT), whole body scan such as position emission tomography (PET), magnetic resonance imaging (MRI), and sonography.","In a specific embodiment, the molecule is labeled with a radioisotope and is detected in the patient using a radiation responsive surgical instrument (Thurston et al., U.S. Pat. No. 5,441,050). In another embodiment, the molecule is labeled with a fluorescent compound and is detected in the patient using a fluorescence responsive scanning instrument. In another embodiment, the molecule is labeled with a positron emitting metal and is detected in the patent using positron emission-tomography. In yet another embodiment, the molecule is labeled with a paramagnetic label and is detected in a patient using magnetic resonance imaging (MRI).","The present invention provides kits that can be used in the above methods. In one embodiment, a kit comprises an antibody of the invention, preferably a purified antibody, in one or more containers. In a specific embodiment, the kits of the present invention contain a substantially isolated polypeptide comprising an epitope which is specifically immunoreactive with an antibody included in the kit. Preferably, the kits of the present invention further comprise a control antibody which does not react with the polypeptide of interest. In another specific embodiment, the kits of the present invention contain a means for detecting the binding of an antibody to a polypeptide of interest (e.g., the antibody may be conjugated to a detectable substrate such as a fluorescent compound, an enzymatic substrate, a radioactive compound or a luminescent compound, or a second antibody which recognizes the first antibody may be conjugated to a detectable substrate).","In another specific embodiment of the present invention, the kit is a diagnostic kit for use in screening serum containing antibodies specific against proliferative and\/or cancerous polynucleotides and polypeptides. Such a kit may include a control antibody that does not react with the polypeptide of interest. Such a kit may include a substantially isolated polypeptide antigen comprising an epitope which is specifically immunoreactive with at least one anti-polypeptide antigen antibody. Further, such a kit includes means for detecting the binding of said antibody to the antigen (e.g., the antibody may be conjugated to a fluorescent compound such as fluorescein or rhodamine which can be detected by flow cytometry). In specific embodiments, the kit may include a recombinantly produced or chemically synthesized polypeptide antigen. The polypeptide antigen of the kit may also be attached to a solid support.","In a more specific embodiment the detecting means of the above-described kit includes a solid support to which said polypeptide antigen is attached. Such a kit may also include a non-attached reporter-labeled anti-human antibody. In this embodiment, binding of the antibody to the polypeptide antigen can be detected by binding of the said reporter-labeled antibody.","In an additional embodiment, the invention includes a diagnostic kit for use in screening serum containing antigens of the polypeptide of the invention. The diagnostic kit includes a substantially isolated antibody specifically immunoreactive with polypeptide or polynucleotide antigens, and means for detecting the binding of the polynucleotide or polypeptide antigen to the antibody. In one embodiment, the antibody is attached to a solid support. In a specific embodiment, the antibody may be a monoclonal antibody. The detecting means of the kit may include a second, labeled monoclonal antibody. Alternatively, or in addition, the detecting means may include a labeled, competing antigen.","In one diagnostic configuration, test serum is reacted with a solid phase reagent having a surface-bound antigen obtained by the methods of the present invention. After binding with specific antigen antibody to the reagent and removing unbound serum components by washing, the reagent is reacted with reporter-labeled anti-human antibody to bind reporter to the reagent in proportion to the amount of bound anti-antigen antibody on the solid support. The reagent is again washed to remove unbound labeled antibody, and the amount of reporter associated with the reagent is determined. Typically, the reporter is an enzyme which is detected by incubating the solid phase in the presence of a suitable fluorometric, luminescent or calorimetric substrate (Sigma, St. Louis, Mo.).","The solid surface reagent in the above assay is prepared by known techniques for attaching protein material to solid support material, such as polymeric beads, dip sticks, 96-well plate or filter material. These attachment methods generally include non-specific adsorption of the protein to the support or covalent attachment of the protein, typically through a free amine group, to a chemically reactive group on the solid support, such as an activated carboxyl, hydroxyl, or aldehyde group. Alternatively, streptavidin coated plates can be used in conjunction with biotinylated antigen(s).","Thus, the invention provides an assay system or kit for carrying out this diagnostic method. The kit generally includes a support with surface-bound recombinant antigens, and a reporter-labeled anti-human antibody for detecting surface-bound anti-antigen antibody.","Any polypeptide of the present invention can be used to generate fusion proteins. For example, the polypeptide of the present invention, when fused to a second protein, can be used as an antigenic tag. Antibodies raised against the polypeptide of the present invention can be used to indirectly detect the second protein by binding to the polypeptide. Moreover, because certain proteins target cellular locations based on trafficking signals, the polypeptides of the present invention can be used as targeting molecules once fused to other proteins.","Examples of domains that can be fused to polypeptides of the present invention include not only heterologous signal sequences, but also other heterologous functional regions. The fusion does not necessarily need to be direct, but may occur through linker sequences.","Moreover, fusion proteins may also be engineered to improve characteristics of the polypeptide of the present invention. For instance, a region of additional amino acids, particularly charged amino acids, may be added to the N-terminus of the polypeptide to improve stability and persistence during purification from the host cell or subsequent handling and storage. Peptide moieties may be added to the polypeptide to facilitate purification. Such regions may be removed prior to final preparation of the polypeptide. Similarly, peptide cleavage sites can be introduced in-between such peptide moieties, which could additionally be subjected to protease activity to remove said peptide(s) from the protein of the present invention. The addition of peptide moieties, including peptide cleavage sites, to facilitate handling of polypeptides are familiar and routine techniques in the art.","Moreover, polypeptides of the present invention, including fragments, and specifically epitopes, can be combined with parts of the constant domain of immunoglobulins (IgA, IgE, IgG, IgM) or portions thereof (CH1, CH2, CH3, and any combination thereof, including both entire domains and portions thereof), resulting in chimeric polypeptides. These fusion proteins facilitate purification and show an increased half-life in vivo. One reported example describes chimeric proteins consisting of the first two domains of the human CD4-polypeptide and various domains of the constant regions of the heavy or light chains of mammalian immunoglobulins. (EP A 394,827; Traunecker et al., Nature 331:84-86 (1988).) Fusion proteins having disulfide-linked dimeric structures (due to the IgG) can also be more efficient in binding and neutralizing other molecules, than the monomeric secreted protein or protein fragment alone. (Fountoulakis et al., J. Biochem. 270:3958-3964 (1995).)","Similarly, EP-A-0 464 533 (Canadian counterpart 2045869) discloses fusion proteins comprising various portions of the constant region of immunoglobulin molecules together with another human protein or part thereof. In many cases, the Fc part in a fusion protein is beneficial in therapy and diagnosis, and thus can result in, for example, improved pharmacokinetic properties. (EP-A 0232 262.) Alternatively, deleting the Fc part after the fusion protein has been expressed, detected, and purified, would be desired. For example, the Fc portion may hinder therapy and diagnosis if the fusion protein is used as an antigen for immunizations. In drug discovery, for example, human proteins, such as hIL-5, have been fused with Fc portions for the purpose of high-throughput screening assays to identify antagonists of hIL-5. (See, D. Bennett et al., J. Molecular Recognition 8:52-58 (1995); K. Johanson et al., J. Biol. Chem . . . 270:9459-9471 (1995).)","Moreover, the polypeptides of the present invention can be fused to marker sequences (also referred to as \u201ctags\u201d). Due to the availability of antibodies specific to such \u201ctags\u201d, purification of the fused polypeptide of the invention, and\/or its identification is significantly facilitated since antibodies specific to the polypeptides of the invention are not required. Such purification may be in the form of an affinity purification whereby an anti-tag antibody or another type of affinity matrix (e.g., anti-tag antibody attached to the matrix of a flow-thru column) that binds to the epitope tag is present. In preferred embodiments, the marker amino acid sequence is a hexa-histidine peptide, such as the tag provided in a pQE vector (QIAGEN, Inc., 9259 Eton Avenue, Chatsworth, Calif., 91311), among others, many of which are commercially available. As described in Gentz et al., Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. USA 86:821-824 (1989), for instance, hexa-histidine provides for convenient purification of the fusion protein. Another peptide tag useful for purification, the \u201cHA\u201d tag, corresponds to an epitope derived from the influenza hemagglutinin protein. (Wilson et al., Cell 37:767 (1984)).","The skilled artisan would acknowledge the existence of other \u201ctags\u201d which could be readily substituted for the tags referred to supra for purification and\/or identification of polypeptides of the present invention (Jones C., et al., J Chromatogr A. 707(1):3-22 (1995)). For example, the c-myc tag and the 8F9, 3C7, 6E10, G4m B7 and 9E10 antibodies thereto (Evan et al., Molecular and Cellular Biology 5:3610-3616 (1985)); the Herpes Simplex virus glycoprotein D (gD) tag and its antibody (Paborsky et al., Protein Engineering, 3(6):547-553 (1990), the Flag-peptide\u2014i.e., the octapeptide sequence DYKDDDDK (SEQ ID NO:16), (Hopp et al., Biotech. 6:1204-1210 (1988); the KT3 epitope peptide (Martin et al., Science, 255:192-194 (1992)); a-tubulin epitope peptide (Skinner et al., J. Biol. Chem., 266:15136-15166, (1991)); the T7 gene 10 protein peptide tag (Lutz-Freyermuth et al., Proc. Natl. Sci. USA, 87:6363-6397 (1990)), the FITC epitope (Zymed, Inc.), the GFP epitope (Zymed, Inc.), and the Rhodamine epitope (Zymed, Inc.).","The present invention also encompasses the attachment of up to nine codons encoding a repeating series of up to nine arginine amino acids to the coding region of a polynucleotide of the present invention. The invention also encompasses chemically derivitizing a polypeptide of the present invention with a repeating series of up to nine arginine amino acids. Such a tag, when attached to a polypeptide, has recently been shown to serve as a universal pass, allowing compounds access to the interior of cells without additional derivitization or manipulation (Wender, P., et al., unpublished data).","Protein fusions involving polypeptides of the present invention, including fragments and\/or variants thereof, can be used for the following, non-limiting examples, subcellular localization of proteins, determination of protein-protein interactions via immunoprecipitation, purification of proteins via affinity chromatography, functional and\/or structural characterization of protein. The present invention also encompasses the application of hapten specific antibodies for any of the uses referenced above for epitope fusion proteins. For example, the polypeptides of the present invention could be chemically derivatized to attach hapten molecules (e.g., DNP, (Zymed, Inc.)). Due to the availability of monoclonal antibodies specific to such haptens, the protein could be readily purified using immunoprecipation, for example.","Polypeptides of the present invention, including fragments and\/or variants thereof, in addition to, antibodies directed against such polypeptides, fragments, and\/or variants, may be fused to any of a number of known, and yet to be determined, toxins, such as ricin, saporin (Mashiba H, et al., Ann. N.Y. Acad. Sci. 1999; 886:233-5), or HC toxin (Tonukari N J, et al., Plant Cell. 2000 February; 12(2):237-248), for example. Such fusions could be used to deliver the toxins to desired tissues for which a ligand or a protein capable of binding to the polypeptides of the invention exists.","The invention encompasses the fusion of antibodies directed against polypeptides of the present invention, including variants and fragments thereof, to said toxins for delivering the toxin to specific locations in a cell, to specific tissues, and\/or to specific species. Such bifunctional antibodies are known in the art, though a review describing additional advantageous fusions, including citations for methods of production, can be found in P. J. Hudson, Curr. Opp. In. Imm. 11:548-557, (1999); this publication, in addition to the references cited therein, are hereby incorporated by reference in their entirety herein. In this context, the term \u201ctoxin\u201d may be expanded to include any heterologous protein, a small molecule, radionucleotides, cytotoxic drugs, liposomes, adhesion molecules, glycoproteins, ligands, cell or tissue-specific ligands, enzymes, of bioactive agents, biological response modifiers, anti-fungal agents, hormones, steroids, vitamins, peptides, peptide analogs, anti-allergenic agents, anti-tubercular agents, anti-viral agents, antibiotics, anti-protozoan agents, chelates, radioactive particles, radioactive ions, X-ray contrast agents, monoclonal antibodies, polyclonal antibodies and genetic material. In view of the present disclosure, one skilled in the art could determine whether any particular \u201ctoxin\u201d could be used in the compounds of the present invention. Examples of suitable \u201ctoxins\u201d listed above are exemplary only and are not intended to limit the \u201ctoxins\u201d that may be used in the present invention.","Thus, any of these above fusions can be engineered using the polynucleotides or the polypeptides of the present invention.","The present invention also relates to vectors containing the polynucleotide of the present invention, host cells, and the production of polypeptides by recombinant techniques. The vector may be, for example, a phage, plasmid, viral, or retroviral vector. Retroviral vectors may be replication competent or replication defective. In the latter case, viral propagation generally will occur only in complementing host cells.","The polynucleotides may be joined to a vector containing a selectable marker for propagation in a host. Generally, a plasmid vector is introduced in a precipitate, such as a calcium phosphate precipitate, or in a complex with a charged lipid. If the vector is a virus, it may be packaged in vitro using an appropriate packaging cell line and then transduced into host cells.","The polynucleotide insert should be operatively linked to an appropriate promoter, such as the phage lambda PL promoter, the lac, trp, phoA and tac promoters, the SV40 early and late promoters and promoters of retroviral LTRs, to name a few. Other suitable promoters will be known to the skilled artisan. The expression constructs will further contain sites for transcription initiation, termination, and, in the transcribed region, a ribosome binding site for translation. The coding portion of the transcripts expressed by the constructs will preferably include a translation initiating codon at the beginning and a termination codon (UAA, UGA or UAG) appropriately positioned at the end of the polypeptide to be translated.","As indicated, the expression vectors will preferably include at least one selectable marker. Such markers include dihydrofolate reductase, G418 or neomycin resistance for eukaryotic cell culture and tetracycline, kanamycin or ampicillin resistance genes for culturing in and other bacteria. Representative examples of appropriate hosts include, but are not limited to, bacterial cells, such as and cells; fungal cells, such as yeast cells (e.g., or (ATCC Accession No. 201178)); insect cells such as S2 and Sf9 cells; animal cells such as CHO, COS, 293, and Bowes melanoma cells; and plant cells. Appropriate culture mediums and conditions for the above-described host cells are known in the art.","Among vectors preferred for use in bacteria include pQE70, pQE60 and pQE-9, available from QIAGEN, Inc.; pBluescript vectors, Phagescript vectors, pNH8A, pNH16a, pNH18A, pNH46A, available from Stratagene Cloning Systems, Inc.; and ptrc99a, pKK223-3, pKK233-3, pDR540, pRIT5 available from Pharmacia Biotech, Inc. Among preferred eukaryotic vectors are pWLNEO, pSV2CAT, pOG44, pXT1 and pSG available from Stratagene; and pSVK3, pBPV, pMSG and pSVL available from Pharmacia. Preferred expression vectors for use in yeast systems include, but are not limited to pYES2, pYD1, pTEF1\/Zeo, pYES2\/GS, pPICZ, pGAPZ, pGAPZalph, pPIC9, pPIC3.5, pHIL-D2, pHIL-S1, pPIC3.5K, pPIC9K, and PAO815 (all available from Invitrogen, Carlsbad, Calif.). Other suitable vectors will be readily apparent to the skilled artisan.","Introduction of the construct into the host cell can be effected by calcium phosphate transfection, DEAE-dextran mediated transfection, cationic lipid-mediated transfection, electroporation, transduction, infection, or other methods. Such methods are described in many standard laboratory manuals, such as Davis et al., Basic Methods In Molecular Biology (1986). It is specifically contemplated that the polypeptides of the present invention may in fact be expressed by a host cell lacking a recombinant vector.","A polypeptide of this invention can be recovered and purified from recombinant cell cultures by well-known methods including ammonium sulfate or ethanol precipitation, acid extraction, anion or cation exchange chromatography, phosphocellulose chromatography, hydrophobic interaction chromatography, affinity chromatography, hydroxylapatite chromatography and lectin chromatography. Most preferably, high performance liquid chromatography (\u201cHPLC\u201d) is employed for purification.","Polypeptides of the present invention, and preferably the secreted form, can also be recovered from: products purified from natural sources, including bodily fluids, tissues and cells, whether directly isolated or cultured; products of chemical synthetic procedures; and products produced by recombinant techniques from a prokaryotic or eukaryotic host, including, for example, bacterial, yeast, higher plant, insect, and mammalian cells. Depending upon the host employed in a recombinant production procedure, the polypeptides of the present invention may be glycosylated or may be non-glycosylated. In addition, polypeptides of the invention may also include an initial modified methionine residue, in some cases as a result of host-mediated processes. Thus, it is well known in the art that the N-terminal methionine encoded by the translation initiation codon generally is removed with high efficiency from any protein after translation in all eukaryotic cells. While the N-terminal methionine on most proteins also is efficiently removed in most prokaryotes, for some proteins, this prokaryotic removal process is inefficient, depending on the nature of the amino acid to which the N-terminal methionine is covalently linked.","In one embodiment, the yeast is used to express the polypeptide of the present invention in a eukaryotic system. is a methylotrophic yeast which can metabolize methanol as its sole carbon source. A main step in the methanol metabolization pathway is the oxidation of methanol to formaldehyde using O2. This reaction is catalyzed by the enzyme alcohol oxidase. In order to metabolize methanol as its sole carbon source, must generate high levels of alcohol oxidase due, in part, to the relatively low affinity of alcohol oxidase for O2. Consequently, in a growth medium depending on methanol as a main carbon source, the promoter region of one of the two alcohol oxidase genes (AOX1) is highly active. In the presence of methanol, alcohol oxidase produced from the AOX1 gene comprises up to approximately 30% of the total soluble protein in . See, Ellis, S. B., et al., Mol. Cell. Biol. 5:1111-21 (1985); Koutz, P. J, et al., Yeast 5:167-77 (1989); Tschopp, J. F., et al., Nucl. Acids Res. 15:3859-76 (1987). Thus, a heterologous coding sequence, such as, for example, a polynucleotide of the present invention, under the transcriptional regulation of all or part of the AOX1 regulatory sequence is expressed at exceptionally high levels in yeast grown in the presence of methanol.","In one example, the plasmid vector pPIC9K is used to express DNA encoding a polypeptide of the invention, as set forth herein, in a Pichea yeast system essentially as described in \u201cProtocols: Methods in Molecular Biology,\u201d D. R. Higgins and J. Cregg, eds. The Humana Press, Totowa, N.J., 1998. This expression vector allows expression and secretion of a protein of the invention by virtue of the strong AOX1 promoter linked to the alkaline phosphatase (PHO) secretory signal peptide (i.e., leader) located upstream of a multiple cloning site.","Many other yeast vectors could be used in place of pPIC9K, such as, pYES2, pYD1, pTEF1\/Zeo, pYES2\/GS, pPICZ, pGAPZ, pGAPZalpha, pPIC9, pPIC3.5, pHIL-D2, pHIL-S1, pPIC3.5K, and PAO815, as one skilled in the art would readily appreciate, as long as the proposed expression construct provides appropriately located signals for transcription, translation, secretion (if desired), and the like, including an in-frame AUG, as required.","In another embodiment, high-level expression of a heterologous coding sequence, such as, for example, a polynucleotide of the present invention, may be achieved by cloning the heterologous polynucleotide of the invention into an expression vector such as, for example, pGAPZ or pGAPZalpha, and growing the yeast culture in the absence of methanol.","In addition to encompassing host cells containing the vector constructs discussed herein, the invention also encompasses primary, secondary, and immortalized host cells of vertebrate origin, particularly mammalian origin, that have been engineered to delete or replace endogenous genetic material (e.g., coding sequence), and\/or to include genetic material (e.g., heterologous polynucleotide sequences) that is operably associated with the polynucleotides of the invention, and which activates, alters, and\/or amplifies endogenous polynucleotides. For example, techniques known in the art may be used to operably associate heterologous control regions (e.g., promoter and\/or enhancer) and endogenous polynucleotide sequences via homologous recombination, resulting in the formation of a new transcription unit (see, e.g., U.S. Pat. No. 5,641,670, issued Jun. 24, 1997; U.S. Pat. No. 5,733,761, issued Mar. 31, 1998; International Publication No. WO 96\/29411, published Sep. 26, 1996; International Publication No. WO 94\/12650, published Aug. 4, 1994; Koller et al., Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. USA 86:8932-8935 (1989); and Zijlstra et al., Nature 342:435-438 (1989), the disclosures of each of which are incorporated by reference in their entireties).","In addition, polypeptides of the invention can be chemically synthesized using techniques known in the art (e.g., see Creighton, 1983, Proteins: Structures and Molecular Principles, W.H. Freeman & Co., N.Y., and Hunkapiller et al., Nature, 310:105-111 (1984)). For example, a polypeptide corresponding to a fragment of a polypeptide sequence of the invention can be synthesized by use of a peptide synthesizer. Furthermore, if desired, nonclassical amino acids or chemical amino acid analogs can be introduced as a substitution or addition into the polypeptide sequence. Non-classical amino acids include, but are not limited to, to the D-isomers of the common amino acids, 2,4-diaminobutyric acid, a-amino isobutyric acid, 4-aminobutyric acid, Abu, 2-amino butyric acid, g-Abu, e-Ahx, 6-amino hexanoic acid, Aib, 2-amino isobutyric acid, 3-amino propionic acid, ornithine, norleucine, norvaline, hydroxyproline, sarcosine, citrulline, homocitrulline, cysteic acid, t-butylglycine, t-butylalanine, phenylglycine, cyclohexylalanine, b-alanine, fluoro-amino acids, designer amino acids such as b-methyl amino acids, Ca-methyl amino acids, Na-methyl amino acids, and amino acid analogs in general. Furthermore, the amino acid can be D (dextrorotary) or L (levorotary).","The invention encompasses polypeptides which are differentially modified during or after translation, e.g., by glycosylation, acetylation, phosphorylation, amidation, derivatization by known protecting\/blocking groups, proteolytic cleavage, linkage to an antibody molecule or other cellular ligand, etc. Any of numerous chemical modifications may be carried out by known techniques, including but not limited, to specific chemical cleavage by cyanogen bromide, trypsin, chymotrypsin, papain, V8 protease, NaBH4; acetylation, formylation, oxidation, reduction; metabolic synthesis in the presence of tunicamycin; etc.","Additional post-translational modifications encompassed by the invention include, for example, e.g., N-linked or O-linked carbohydrate chains, processing of N-terminal or C-terminal ends), attachment of chemical moieties to the amino acid backbone, chemical modifications of N-linked or O-linked carbohydrate chains, and addition or deletion of an N-terminal methionine residue as a result of prokaryotic host cell expression. The polypeptides may also be modified with a detectable label, such as an enzymatic, fluorescent, isotopic or affinity label to allow for detection and isolation of the protein, the addition of epitope tagged peptide fragments (e.g., FLAG, HA, GST, thioredoxin, maltose binding protein, etc.), attachment of affinity tags such as biotin and\/or streptavidin, the covalent attachment of chemical moieties to the amino acid backbone, N- or C-terminal processing of the polypeptides ends (e.g., proteolytic processing), deletion of the N-terminal methionine residue, etc.","Also provided by the invention are chemically modified derivatives of the polypeptides of the invention which may provide additional advantages such as increased solubility, stability and circulating time of the polypeptide, or decreased immunogenicity (see U.S. Pat. No. 4,179,337). The chemical moieties for derivitization may be selected from water soluble polymers such as polyethylene glycol, ethylene glycol\/propylene glycol copolymers, carboxymethylcellulose, dextran, polyvinyl alcohol and the like. The polypeptides may be modified at random positions within the molecule, or at predetermined positions within the molecule and may include one, two, three or more attached chemical moieties.","The invention further encompasses chemical derivitization of the polypeptides of the present invention, preferably where the chemical is a hydrophilic polymer residue. Exemplary hydrophilic polymers, including derivatives, may be those that include polymers in which the repeating units contain one or more hydroxy groups (polyhydroxy polymers), including, for example, poly(vinyl alcohol); polymers in which the repeating units contain one or more amino groups (polyamine polymers), including, for example, peptides, polypeptides, proteins and lipoproteins, such as albumin and natural lipoproteins; polymers in which the repeating units contain one or more carboxy groups (polycarboxy polymers), including, for example, carboxymethylcellulose, alginic acid and salts thereof, such as sodium and calcium alginate, glycosaminoglycans and salts thereof, including salts of hyaluronic acid, phosphorylated and sulfonated derivatives of carbohydrates, genetic material, such as interleukin-2 and interferon, and phosphorothioate oligomers; and polymers in which the repeating units contain one or more saccharide moieties (polysaccharide polymers), including, for example, carbohydrates.","The molecular weight of the hydrophilic polymers may vary, and is generally about 50 to about 5,000,000, with polymers having a molecular weight of about 100 to about 50,000 being preferred. The polymers may be branched or unbranched. More preferred polymers have a molecular weight of about 150 to about 10,000, with molecular weights of 200 to about 8,000 being even more preferred.","For polyethylene glycol, the preferred molecular weight is between about 1 kDa and about 100 kDa (the term \u201cabout\u201d indicating that in preparations of polyethylene glycol, some molecules will weigh more, some less, than the stated molecular weight) for ease in handling and manufacturing. Other sizes may be used, depending on the desired therapeutic profile (e.g., the duration of sustained release desired, the effects, if any on biological activity, the ease in handling, the degree or lack of antigenicity and other known effects of the polyethylene glycol to a therapeutic protein or analog).","Additional preferred polymers which may be used to derivatize polypeptides of the invention, include, for example, poly(ethylene glycol) (PEG), poly(vinylpyrrolidine), polyoxomers, polysorbate and poly(vinyl alcohol), with PEG polymers being particularly preferred. Preferred among the PEG polymers are PEG polymers having a molecular weight of from about 100 to about 10,000. More preferably, the PEG polymers have a molecular weight of from about 200 to about 8,000, with PEG 2,000, PEG 5,000 and PEG 8,000, which have molecular weights of 2,000, 5,000 and 8,000, respectively, being even more preferred. Other suitable hydrophilic polymers, in addition to those exemplified above, will be readily apparent to one skilled in the art based on the present disclosure. Generally, the polymers used may include polymers that can be attached to the polypeptides of the invention via alkylation or acylation reactions.","The polyethylene glycol molecules (or other chemical moieties) should be attached to the protein with consideration of effects on functional or antigenic domains of the protein. There are a number of attachment methods available to those skilled in the art, e.g., EP 0 401 384, herein incorporated by reference (coupling PEG to G-CSF), see also Malik et al., Exp. Hematol. 20:1028-1035 (1992) (reporting pegylation of GM-CSF using tresyl chloride). For example, polyethylene glycol may be covalently bound through amino acid residues via a reactive group, such as, a free amino or carboxyl group. Reactive groups are those to which an activated polyethylene glycol molecule may be bound. The amino acid residues having a free amino group may include lysine residues and the N-terminal amino acid residues; those having a free carboxyl group may include aspartic acid residues glutamic acid residues and the C-terminal amino acid residue. Sulfhydryl groups may also be used as a reactive group for attaching the polyethylene glycol molecules. Preferred for therapeutic purposes is attachment at an amino group, such as attachment at the N-terminus or lysine group.","One may specifically desire proteins chemically modified at the N-terminus. Using polyethylene glycol as an illustration of the present composition, one may select from a variety of polyethylene glycol molecules (by molecular weight, branching, etc.), the proportion of polyethylene glycol molecules to protein (polypeptide) molecules in the reaction mix, the type of pegylation reaction to be performed, and the method of obtaining the selected N-terminally pegylated protein. The method of obtaining the N-terminally pegylated preparation (i.e., separating this moiety from other monopegylated moieties if necessary) may be by purification of the N-terminally pegylated material from a population of pegylated protein molecules. Selective proteins chemically modified at the N-terminus modification may be accomplished by reductive alkylation which exploits differential reactivity of different types of primary amino groups (lysine versus the N-terminus) available for derivatization in a particular protein. Under the appropriate reaction conditions, substantially selective derivatization of the protein at the N-terminus with a carbonyl group containing polymer is achieved.","As with the various polymers exemplified above, it is contemplated that the polymeric residues may contain functional groups in addition, for example, to those typically involved in linking the polymeric residues to the polypeptides of the present invention. Such functionalities include, for example, carboxyl, amine, hydroxy and thiol groups. These functional groups on the polymeric residues can be further reacted, if desired, with materials that are generally reactive with such functional groups and which can assist in targeting specific tissues in the body including, for example, diseased tissue. Exemplary materials which can be reacted with the additional functional groups include, for example, proteins, including antibodies, carbohydrates, peptides, glycopeptides, glycolipids, lectins, and nucleosides.","In addition to residues of hydrophilic polymers, the chemical used to derivatize the polypeptides of the present invention can be a saccharide residue. Exemplary saccharides which can be derived include, for example, monosaccharides or sugar alcohols, such as erythrose, threose, ribose, arabinose, xylose, lyxose, fructose, sorbitol, mannitol and sedoheptulose, with preferred monosaccharides being fructose, mannose, xylose, arabinose, mannitol and sorbitol; and disaccharides, such as lactose, sucrose, maltose and cellobiose. Other saccharides include, for example, inositol and ganglioside head groups. Other suitable saccharides, in addition to those exemplified above, will be readily apparent to one skilled in the art based on the present disclosure. Generally, saccharides which may be used for derivitization include saccharides that can be attached to the polypeptides of the invention via alkylation or acylation reactions.","Moreover, the invention also encompasses derivitization of the polypeptides of the present invention, for example, with lipids (including cationic, anionic, polymerized, charged, synthetic, saturated, unsaturated, and any combination of the above, etc.). stabilizing agents.","The invention encompasses derivitization of the polypeptides of the present invention, for example, with compounds that may serve a stabilizing function (e.g., to increase the polypeptides half-life in solution, to make the polypeptides more water soluble, to increase the polypeptides hydrophilic or hydrophobic character, etc.). Polymers useful as stabilizing materials may be of natural, semi-synthetic (modified natural) or synthetic origin. Exemplary natural polymers include naturally occurring polysaccharides, such as, for example, arabinans, fructans, fucans, galactans, galacturonans, glucans, mannans, xylans (such as, for example, inulin), levan, fucoidan, carrageenan, galatocarolose, pectic acid, pectins, including amylose, pullulan, glycogen, amylopectin, cellulose, dextran, dextrin, dextrose, glucose, polyglucose, polydextrose, pustulan, chitin, agarose, keratin, chondroitin, dermatan, hyaluronic acid, alginic acid, xanthin gum, starch and various other natural homopolymer or heteropolymers, such as those containing one or more of the following aldoses, ketoses, acids or amines: erythose, threose, ribose, arabinose, xylose, lyxose, allose, altrose, glucose, dextrose, mannose, gulose, idose, galactose, talose, erythrulose, ribulose, xylulose, psicose, fructose, sorbose, tagatose, mannitol, sorbitol, lactose, sucrose, trehalose, maltose, cellobiose, glycine, serine, threonine, cysteine, tyrosine, asparagine, glutamine, aspartic acid, glutamic acid, lysine, arginine, histidine, glucuronic acid, gluconic acid, glucaric acid, galacturonic acid, mannuronic acid, glucosamine, galactosamine, and neuraminic acid, and naturally occurring derivatives thereof. Accordingly, suitable polymers include, for example, proteins, such as albumin, polyalginates, and polylactide-coglycolide polymers. Exemplary semi-synthetic polymers include carboxymethylcellulose, hydroxymethylcellulose, hydroxypropylmethylcellulose, methylcellulose, and methoxycellulose. Exemplary synthetic polymers include polyphosphazenes, hydroxyapatites, fluoroapatite polymers, polyethylenes (such as, for example, polyethylene glycol (including for example, the class of compounds referred to as Pluronics\u00ae, commercially available from BASF, Parsippany, N.J.), polyoxyethylene, and polyethylene terephthlate), polypropylenes (such as, for example, polypropylene glycol), polyurethanes (such as, for example, polyvinyl alcohol (PVA), polyvinyl chloride and polyvinylpyrrolidone), polyamides including nylon, polystyrene, polylactic acids, fluorinated hydrocarbon polymers, fluorinated carbon polymers (such as, for example, polytetrafluoroethylene), acrylate, methacrylate, and polymethylmethacrylate, and derivatives thereof. Methods for the preparation of derivatized polypeptides of the invention which employ polymers as stabilizing compounds will be readily apparent to one skilled in the art, in view of the present disclosure, when coupled with information known in the art, such as that described and referred to in Unger, U.S. Pat. No. 5,205,290, the disclosure of which is hereby incorporated by reference herein in its entirety.","Moreover, the invention encompasses additional modifications of the polypeptides of the present invention. Such additional modifications are known in the art, and are specifically provided, in addition to methods of derivitization, etc., in U.S. Pat. No. 6,028,066, which is hereby incorporated in its entirety herein.","The polypeptides of the invention may be in monomers or multimers (i.e., dimers, trimers, tetramers and higher multimers). Accordingly, the present invention relates to monomers and multimers of the polypeptides of the invention, their preparation, and compositions (preferably, Therapeutics) containing them. In specific embodiments, the polypeptides of the invention are monomers, dimers, trimers or tetramers. In additional embodiments, the multimers of the invention are at least dimers, at least trimers, or at least tetramers.","Multimers encompassed by the invention may be homomers or heteromers. As used herein, the term homomer, refers to a multimer containing only polypeptides corresponding to the amino acid sequence of SEQ ID NO:2, 4, 6, 8, 10 and\/or 12 or encoded by the cDNA contained in a deposited clone (including fragments, variants, splice variants, and fusion proteins, corresponding to these polypeptides as described herein). These homomers may contain polypeptides having identical or different amino acid sequences. In a specific embodiment, a homomer of the invention is a multimer containing only polypeptides having an identical amino acid sequence. In another specific embodiment, a homomer of the invention is a multimer containing polypeptides having different amino acid sequences. In specific embodiments, the multimer of the invention is a homodimer (e.g., containing polypeptides having identical or different amino acid sequences) or a homotrimer (e.g., containing polypeptides having identical and\/or different amino acid sequences). In additional embodiments, the homomeric multimer of the invention is at least a homodimer, at least a homotrimer, or at least a homotetramer.","As used herein, the term heteromer refers to a multimer containing one or more heterologous polypeptides (i.e., polypeptides of different proteins) in addition to the polypeptides of the invention. In a specific embodiment, the multimer of the invention is a heterodimer, a heterotrimer, or a heterotetramer. In additional embodiments, the heteromeric multimer of the invention is at least a heterodimer, at least a heterotrimer, or at least a heterotetramer.","Multimers of the invention may be the result of hydrophobic, hydrophilic, ionic and\/or covalent associations and\/or may be indirectly linked, by for example, liposome formation. Thus, in one embodiment, multimers of the invention, such as, for example, homodimers or homotrimers, are formed when polypeptides of the invention contact one another in solution. In another embodiment, heteromultimers of the invention, such as, for example, heterotrimers or heterotetramers, are formed when polypeptides of the invention contact antibodies to the polypeptides of the invention (including antibodies to the heterologous polypeptide sequence in a fusion protein of the invention) in solution. In other embodiments, multimers of the invention are formed by covalent associations with and\/or between the polypeptides of the invention. Such covalent associations may involve one or more amino acid residues contained in the polypeptide sequence (e.g., that recited in the sequence listing, or contained in the polypeptide encoded by a deposited clone). In one instance, the covalent associations are cross-linking between cysteine residues located within the polypeptide sequences which interact in the native (i.e., naturally occurring) polypeptide. In another instance, the covalent associations are the consequence of chemical or recombinant manipulation. Alternatively, such covalent associations may involve one or more amino acid residues contained in the heterologous polypeptide sequence in a fusion protein of the invention.","In one example, covalent associations are between the heterologous sequence contained in a fusion protein of the invention (see, e.g., U.S. Pat. No. 5,478,925). In a specific example, the covalent associations are between the heterologous sequence contained in an Fc fusion protein of the invention (as described herein). In another specific example, covalent associations of fusion proteins of the invention are between heterologous polypeptide sequence from another protein that is capable of forming covalently associated multimers, such as for example, osteoprotegerin (see, e.g., International Publication NO: WO 98\/49305, the contents of which are herein incorporated by reference in its entirety). In another embodiment, two or more polypeptides of the invention are joined through peptide linkers. Examples include those peptide linkers described in U.S. Pat. No. 5,073,627 (hereby incorporated by reference). Proteins comprising multiple polypeptides of the invention separated by peptide linkers may be produced using conventional recombinant DNA technology.","Another method for preparing multimer polypeptides of the invention involves use of polypeptides of the invention fused to a leucine zipper or isoleucine zipper polypeptide sequence. Leucine zipper and isoleucine zipper domains are polypeptides that promote multimerization of the proteins in which they are found. Leucine zippers were originally identified in several DNA-binding proteins (Landschulz et al., Science 240:1759, (1988)), and have since been found in a variety of different proteins. Among the known leucine zippers are naturally occurring peptides and derivatives thereof that dimerize or trimerize. Examples of leucine zipper domains suitable for producing soluble multimeric proteins of the invention are those described in PCT application WO 94\/10308, hereby incorporated by reference. Recombinant fusion proteins comprising a polypeptide of the invention fused to a polypeptide sequence that dimerizes or trimerizes in solution are expressed in suitable host cells, and the resulting soluble multimeric fusion protein is recovered from the culture supernatant using techniques known in the art.","Trimeric polypeptides of the invention may offer the advantage of enhanced biological activity. Preferred leucine zipper moieties and isoleucine moieties are those that preferentially form trimers. One example is a leucine zipper derived from lung surfactant protein D (SPD), as described in Hoppe et al. (FEBS Letters 344:191, (1994)) and in U.S. patent application Ser. No. 08\/446,922, hereby incorporated by reference. Other peptides derived from naturally occurring trimeric proteins may be employed in preparing trimeric polypeptides of the invention.","In another example, proteins of the invention are associated by interactions between Flag\u00ae polypeptide sequence contained in fusion proteins of the invention containing Flag\u00ae polypeptide sequence. In a further embodiment, associations proteins of the invention are associated by interactions between heterologous polypeptide sequence contained in Flag\u00ae fusion proteins of the invention and anti-Flag\u00ae antibody.","The multimers of the invention may be generated using chemical techniques known in the art. For example, polypeptides desired to be contained in the multimers of the invention may be chemically cross-linked using linker molecules and linker molecule length optimization techniques known in the art (see, e.g., U.S. Pat. No. 5,478,925, which is herein incorporated by reference in its entirety). Additionally, multimers of the invention may be generated using techniques known in the art to form one or more inter-molecule cross-links between the cysteine residues located within the sequence of the polypeptides desired to be contained in the multimer (see, e.g., U.S. Pat. No. 5,478,925, which is herein incorporated by reference in its entirety). Further, polypeptides of the invention may be routinely modified by the addition of cysteine or biotin to the C terminus or N-terminus of the polypeptide and techniques known in the art may be applied to generate multimers containing one or more of these modified polypeptides (see, e.g., U.S. Pat. No. 5,478,925, which is herein incorporated by reference in its entirety). Additionally, techniques known in the art may be applied to generate liposomes containing the polypeptide components desired to be contained in the multimer of the invention (see, e.g., U.S. Pat. No. 5,478,925, which is herein incorporated by reference in its entirety).","Alternatively, multimers of the invention may be generated using genetic engineering techniques known in the art. In one embodiment, polypeptides contained in multimers of the invention are produced recombinantly using fusion protein technology described herein or otherwise known in the art (see, e.g., U.S. Pat. No. 5,478,925, which is herein incorporated by reference in its entirety). In a specific embodiment, polynucleotides coding for a homodimer of the invention are generated by ligating a polynucleotide sequence encoding a polypeptide of the invention to a sequence encoding a linker polypeptide and then further to a synthetic polynucleotide encoding the translated product of the polypeptide in the reverse orientation from the original C-terminus to the N-terminus (lacking the leader sequence) (see, e.g., U.S. Pat. No. 5,478,925, which is herein incorporated by reference in its entirety). In another embodiment, recombinant techniques described herein or otherwise known in the art are applied to generate recombinant polypeptides of the invention which contain a transmembrane domain (or hydrophobic or signal peptide) and which can be incorporated by membrane reconstitution techniques into liposomes (see, e.g., U.S. Pat. No. 5,478,925, which is herein incorporated by reference in its entirety).","In addition, the polynucleotide insert of the present invention could be operatively linked to \u201cartificial\u201d or chimeric promoters and transcription factors. Specifically, the artificial promoter could comprise, or alternatively consist, of any combination of cis-acting DNA sequence elements that are recognized by trans-acting transcription factors. Preferably, the cis acting DNA sequence elements and trans-acting transcription factors are operable in mammals. Further, the trans-acting transcription factors of such \u201cartificial\u201d promoters could also be \u201cartificial\u201d or chimeric in design themselves and could act as activators or repressors to said \u201cartificial\u201d promoter.","Each of the polynucleotides identified herein can be used in numerous ways as reagents. The following description should be considered exemplary and utilizes known techniques.","The polynucleotides of the present invention are useful for chromosome identification. There exists an ongoing need to identify new chromosome markers, since few chromosome marking reagents, based on actual sequence data (repeat polymorphisms), are presently available. Each polynucleotide of the present invention can be used as a chromosome marker.","Briefly, sequences can be mapped to chromosomes by preparing PCR primers (preferably 15-25 bp) from the sequences shown in SEQ ID NO:1, 3, 5, 7, 9 and\/or 11. Primers can be selected using computer analysis so that primers do not span more than one predicted exon in the genomic DNA. These primers are then used for PCR screening of somatic cell hybrids containing individual human chromosomes. Only those hybrids containing the human gene corresponding to the SEQ ID NO:1, 3, 5, 7, 9 and\/or 11 will yield an amplified fragment.","Similarly, somatic hybrids provide a rapid method of PCR mapping the polynucleotides to particular chromosomes. Three or more clones can be assigned per day using a single thermal cycler. Moreover, sublocalization of the polynucleotides can be achieved with panels of specific chromosome fragments. Other gene mapping strategies that can be used include in situ hybridization, prescreening with labeled flow-sorted chromosomes, and preselection by hybridization to construct chromosome specific-cDNA libraries.","Precise chromosomal location of the polynucleotides can also be achieved using fluorescence in situ hybridization (FISH) of a metaphase chromosomal spread. This technique uses polynucleotides as short as 500 or 600 bases; however, polynucleotides 2,000-4,000 bp are preferred. For a review of this technique, see Verma et al., \u201cHuman Chromosomes: a Manual of Basic Techniques,\u201d Pergamon Press, New York (1988).","For chromosome mapping, the polynucleotides can be used individually (to mark a single chromosome or a single site on that chromosome) or in panels (for marking multiple sites and\/or multiple chromosomes). Preferred polynucleotides correspond to the noncoding regions of the cDNAs because the coding sequences are more likely conserved within gene families, thus increasing the chance of cross hybridization during chromosomal mapping.","Once a polynucleotide has been mapped to a precise chromosomal location, the physical position of the polynucleotide can be used in linkage analysis. Linkage analysis establishes coinheritance between a chromosomal location and presentation of a particular disease. Disease mapping data are known in the art. Assuming 1 megabase mapping resolution and one gene per 20 kb, a cDNA precisely localized to a chromosomal region associated with the disease could be one of 50-500 potential causative genes.","Thus, once coinheritance is established, differences in the polynucleotide and the corresponding gene between affected and unaffected organisms can be examined. First, visible structural alterations in the chromosomes, such as deletions or translocations, are examined in chromosome spreads or by PCR. If no structural alterations exist, the presence of point mutations are ascertained. Mutations observed in some or all affected organisms, but not in normal organisms, indicates that the mutation may cause the disease. However, complete sequencing of the polypeptide and the corresponding gene from several normal organisms is required to distinguish the mutation from a polymorphism. If a new polymorphism is identified, this polymorphic polypeptide can be used for further linkage analysis.","Furthermore, increased or decreased expression of the gene in affected organisms as compared to unaffected organisms can be assessed using polynucleotides of the present invention. Any of these alterations (altered expression, chromosomal rearrangement, or mutation) can be used as a diagnostic or prognostic marker.","Thus, the invention also provides a diagnostic method useful during diagnosis of a disorder, involving measuring the expression level of polynucleotides of the present invention in cells or body fluid from an organism and comparing the measured gene expression level with a standard level of polynucleotide expression level, whereby an increase or decrease in the gene expression level compared to the standard is indicative of a disorder.","By \u201cmeasuring the expression level of a polynucleotide of the present invention\u201d is intended qualitatively or quantitatively measuring or estimating the level of the polypeptide of the present invention or the level of the mRNA encoding the polypeptide in a first biological sample either directly (e.g., by determining or estimating absolute protein level or mRNA level) or relatively (e.g., by comparing to the polypeptide level or mRNA level in a second biological sample). Preferably, the polypeptide level or mRNA level in the first biological sample is measured or estimated and compared to a standard polypeptide level or mRNA level, the standard being taken from a second biological sample obtained from an individual not having the disorder or being determined by averaging levels from a population of organisms not having a disorder. As will be appreciated in the art, once a standard polypeptide level or mRNA level is known, it can be used repeatedly as a standard for comparison.","By \u201cbiological sample\u201d is intended any biological sample obtained from an organism, body fluids, cell line, tissue culture, or other source which contains the polypeptide of the present invention or mRNA. As indicated, biological samples include body fluids (such as the following non-limiting examples, sputum, amniotic fluid, urine, saliva, breast milk, secretions, interstitial fluid, blood, serum, spinal fluid, etc.) which contain the polypeptide of the present invention, and other tissue sources found to express the polypeptide of the present invention. Methods for obtaining tissue biopsies and body fluids from organisms are well known in the art. Where the biological sample is to include mRNA, a tissue biopsy is the preferred source.","The method(s) provided above may Preferably be applied in a diagnostic method and\/or kits in which polynucleotides and\/or polypeptides are attached to a solid support. In one exemplary method, the support may be a \u201cgene chip\u201d or a \u201cbiological chip\u201d as described in U.S. Pat. Nos. 5,837,832, 5,874,219, and 5,856,174. Further, such a gene chip with polynucleotides of the present invention attached may be used to identify polymorphisms between the polynucleotide sequences, with polynucleotides isolated from a test subject. The knowledge of such polymorphisms (i.e. their location, as well as, their existence) would be beneficial in identifying disease loci for many disorders, including proliferative diseases and conditions. Such a method is described in U.S. Pat. Nos. 5,858,659 and 5,856,104. The US patents referenced supra are hereby incorporated by reference in their entirety herein.","The present invention encompasses polynucleotides of the present invention that are chemically synthesized, or reproduced as peptide nucleic acids (PNA), or according to other methods known in the art. The use of PNAs would serve as the preferred form if the polynucleotides are incorporated onto a solid support, or gene chip. For the purposes of the present invention, a peptide nucleic acid (PNA) is a polyamide type of DNA analog and the monomeric units for adenine, guanine, thymine and cytosine are available commercially (Perceptive Biosystems). Certain components of DNA, such as phosphorus, phosphorus oxides, or deoxyribose derivatives, are not present in PNAs. As disclosed by P. E. Nielsen, M. Egholm, R. H. Berg and O. Buchardt, Science 254, 1497 (1991); and M. Egholm, O. Buchardt, L. Christensen, C. Behrens, S. M. Freier, D. A. Driver, R. H. Berg, S. K. Kim, B. Norden, and P. E. Nielsen, Nature 365, 666 (1993), PNAs bind specifically and tightly to complementary DNA strands and are not degraded by nucleases. In fact, PNA binds more strongly to DNA than DNA itself does. This is probably because there is no electrostatic repulsion between the two strands, and also the polyamide backbone is more flexible. Because of this, PNA\/DNA duplexes bind under a wider range of stringency conditions than DNA\/DNA duplexes, making it easier to perform multiplex hybridization. Smaller probes can be used than with DNA due to the stronger binding characteristics of PNA:DNA hybrids. In addition, it is more likely that single base mismatches can be determined with PNA\/DNA hybridization because a single mismatch in a PNA\/DNA 15-mer lowers the melting point (T.sub.m) by 8\u00b0-20\u00b0 C., vs. 4\u00b0-16\u00b0 C. for the DNA\/DNA 15-mer duplex. Also, the absence of charge groups in PNA means that hybridization can be done at low ionic strengths and reduce possible interference by salt during the analysis.","In addition to the foregoing, a polynucleotide can be used to control gene expression through triple helix formation or antisense DNA or RNA. Antisense techniques are discussed, for example, in Okano, J. Neurochem. 56: 560 (1991); \u201cOligodeoxynucleotides as Antisense Inhibitors of Gene Expression, CRC Press, Boca Raton, Fla. (1988). Triple helix formation is discussed in, for instance Lee et al., Nucleic Acids Research 6: 3073 (1979); Cooney et al., Science 241: 456 (1988); and Dervan et al., Science 251: 1360 (1991). Both methods rely on binding of the polynucleotide to a complementary DNA or RNA. For these techniques, preferred polynucleotides are usually oligonucleotides 20 to 40 bases in length and complementary to either the region of the gene involved in transcription (triple helix\u2014see Lee et al., Nucl. Acids Res. 6:3073 (1979); Cooney et al., Science 241:456 (1988); and Dervan et al., Science 251:1360 (1991)) or to the mRNA itself (antisense\u2014Okano, J. Neurochem. 56:560 (1991); Oligodeoxy-nucleotides as Antisense Inhibitors of Gene Expression, CRC Press, Boca Raton, Fla. (1988).) Triple helix formation optimally results in a shut-off of RNA transcription from DNA, while antisense RNA hybridization blocks translation of an mRNA molecule into polypeptide. Both techniques are effective in model systems, and the information disclosed herein can be used to design antisense or triple helix polynucleotides in an effort to treat or prevent disease.","The present invention encompasses the addition of a nuclear localization signal, operably linked to the 5\u2032 end, 3\u2032 end, or any location therein, to any of the oligonucleotides, antisense oligonucleotides, triple helix oligonucleotides, ribozymes, PNA oligonucleotides, and\/or polynucleotides, of the present invention. See, for example, G. Cutrona, et al., Nat. Biotech., 18:300-303, (2000); which is hereby incorporated herein by reference.","Polynucleotides of the present invention are also useful in gene therapy. One goal of gene therapy is to insert a normal gene into an organism having a defective gene, in an effort to correct the genetic defect. The polynucleotides disclosed in the present invention offer a means of targeting such genetic defects in a highly accurate manner. Another goal is to insert a new gene that was not present in the host genome, thereby producing a new trait in the host cell. In one example, polynucleotide sequences of the present invention may be used to construct chimeric RNA\/DNA oligonucleotides corresponding to said sequences, specifically designed to induce host cell mismatch repair mechanisms in an organism upon systemic injection, for example (Bartlett, R. J., et al., Nat. Biotech, 18:615-622 (2000), which is hereby incorporated by reference herein in its entirety). Such RNA\/DNA oligonucleotides could be designed to correct genetic defects in certain host strains, and\/or to introduce desired phenotypes in the host (e.g., introduction of a specific polymorphism within an endogenous gene corresponding to a polynucleotide of the present invention that may ameliorate and\/or prevent a disease symptom and\/or disorder, etc.). Alternatively, the polynucleotide sequence of the present invention may be used to construct duplex oligonucleotides corresponding to said sequence, specifically designed to correct genetic defects in certain host strains, and\/or to introduce desired phenotypes into the host (e.g., introduction of a specific polymorphism within an endogenous gene corresponding to a polynucleotide of the present invention that may ameliorate and\/or prevent a disease symptom and\/or disorder, etc). Such methods of using duplex oligonucleotides are known in the art and are encompassed by the present invention (see EP1007712, which is hereby incorporated by reference herein in its entirety).","The polynucleotides are also useful for identifying organisms from minute biological samples. The United States military, for example, is considering the use of restriction fragment length polymorphism (RFLP) for identification of its personnel. In this technique, an individual's genomic DNA is digested with one or more restriction enzymes, and probed on a Southern blot to yield unique bands for identifying personnel. This method does not suffer from the current limitations of \u201cDog Tags\u201d which can be lost, switched, or stolen, making positive identification difficult. The polynucleotides of the present invention can be used as additional DNA markers for RFLP.","The polynucleotides of the present invention can also be used as an alternative to RFLP, by determining the actual base-by-base DNA sequence of selected portions of an organisms genome. These sequences can be used to prepare PCR primers for amplifying and isolating such selected DNA, which can then be sequenced. Using this technique, organisms can be identified because each organism will have a unique set of DNA sequences. Once an unique ID database is established for an organism, positive identification of that organism, living or dead, can be made from extremely small tissue samples. Similarly, polynucleotides of the present invention can be used as polymorphic markers, in addition to, the identification of transformed or non-transformed cells and\/or tissues.","There is also a need for reagents capable of identifying the source of a particular tissue. Such need arises, for example, when presented with tissue of unknown origin. Appropriate reagents can comprise, for example, DNA probes or primers specific to particular tissue prepared from the sequences of the present invention. Panels of such reagents can identify tissue by species and\/or by organ type. In a similar fashion, these reagents can be used to screen tissue cultures for contamination. Moreover, as mentioned above, such reagents can be used to screen and\/or identify transformed and non-transformed cells and\/or tissues.","In the very least, the polynucleotides of the present invention can be used as molecular weight markers on Southern gels, as diagnostic probes for the presence of a specific mRNA in a particular cell type, as a probe to \u201csubtract-out\u201d known sequences in the process of discovering novel polynucleotides, for selecting and making oligomers for attachment to a \u201cgene chip\u201d or other support, to raise anti-DNA antibodies using DNA immunization techniques, and as an antigen to elicit an immune response.","Each of the polypeptides identified herein can be used in numerous ways. The following description should be considered exemplary and utilizes known techniques.","A polypeptide of the present invention can be used to assay protein levels in a biological sample using antibody-based techniques. For example, protein expression in tissues can be studied with classical immunohistological methods. (Jalkanen, M., et al., J. Cell. Biol. 101:976-985 (1985); Jalkanen, M., et al., J. Cell. Biol. 105:3087-3096 (1987).) Other antibody-based methods useful for detecting protein gene expression include immunoassays, such as the enzyme linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA) and the radioimmunoassay (RIA). Suitable antibody assay labels are known in the art and include enzyme labels, such as, glucose oxidase, and radioisotopes, such as iodine (125I, 121I), carbon (14C), sulfur (35S), tritium (3H), indium (112In), and technetium (99mTc), and fluorescent labels, such as fluorescein and rhodamine, and biotin.","In addition to assaying protein levels in a biological sample, proteins can also be detected in vivo by imaging. Antibody labels or markers for in vivo imaging of protein include those detectable by X-radiography, NMR or ESR. For X-radiography, suitable labels include radioisotopes such as barium or cesium, which emit detectable radiation but are not overtly harmful to the subject. Suitable markers for NMR and ESR include those with a detectable characteristic spin, such as deuterium, which may be incorporated into the antibody by labeling of nutrients for the relevant hybridoma.","A protein-specific antibody or antibody fragment which has been labeled with an appropriate detectable imaging moiety, such as a radioisotope (for example, 131I, 112In, 99mTc), a radio-opaque substance, or a material detectable by nuclear magnetic resonance, is introduced (for example, parenterally, subcutaneously, or intraperitoneally) into the mammal. It will be understood in the art that the size of the subject and the imaging system used will determine the quantity of imaging moiety needed to produce diagnostic images. In the case of a radioisotope moiety, for a human subject, the quantity of radioactivity injected will normally range from about 5 to 20 millicuries of 99mTc. The labeled antibody or antibody fragment will then preferentially accumulate at the location of cells which contain the specific protein. In vivo tumor imaging is described in S. W. Burchiel et al., \u201cImmunopharmacokinetics of Radiolabeled Antibodies and Their Fragments.\u201d (Chapter 13 in Tumor Imaging: The Radiochemical Detection of Cancer, S. W. Burchiel and B. A. Rhodes, eds., Masson Publishing Inc. (1982).)","Thus, the invention provides a diagnostic method of a disorder, which involves (a) assaying the expression of a polypeptide of the present invention in cells or body fluid of an individual; (b) comparing the level of gene expression with a standard gene expression level, whereby an increase or decrease in the assayed polypeptide gene expression level compared to the standard expression level is indicative of a disorder. With respect to cancer, the presence of a relatively high amount of transcript in biopsied tissue from an individual may indicate a predisposition for the development of the disease, or may provide a means for detecting the disease prior to the appearance of actual clinical symptoms. A more definitive diagnosis of this type may allow health professionals to employ preventative measures or aggressive treatment earlier thereby preventing the development or further progression of the cancer.","Moreover, polypeptides of the present invention can be used to treat, prevent, and\/or diagnose disease. For example, patients can be administered a polypeptide of the present invention in an effort to replace absent or decreased levels of the polypeptide (e.g., insulin), to supplement absent or decreased levels of a different polypeptide (e.g., hemoglobin S for hemoglobin B, SOD, catalase, DNA repair proteins), to inhibit the activity of a polypeptide (e.g., an oncogene or tumor suppressor), to activate the activity of a polypeptide (e.g., by binding to a receptor), to reduce the activity of a membrane bound receptor by competing with it for free ligand (e.g., soluble TNF receptors used in reducing inflammation), or to bring about a desired response (e.g., blood vessel growth inhibition, enhancement of the immune response to proliferative cells or tissues).","Similarly, antibodies directed to a polypeptide of the present invention can also be used to treat, prevent, and\/or diagnose disease. For example, administration of an antibody directed to a polypeptide of the present invention can bind and reduce overproduction of the polypeptide. Similarly, administration of an antibody can activate the polypeptide, such as by binding to a polypeptide bound to a membrane (receptor).","At the very least, the polypeptides of the present invention can be used as molecular weight markers on SDS-PAGE gels or on molecular sieve gel filtration columns using methods well known to those of skill in the art. Polypeptides can also be used to raise antibodies, which in turn are used to measure protein expression from a recombinant cell, as a way of assessing transformation of the host cell. Moreover, the polypeptides of the present invention can be used to test the following biological activities.","Another aspect of the present invention is to gene therapy methods for treating or preventing disorders, diseases and conditions. The gene therapy methods relate to the introduction of nucleic acid (DNA, RNA and antisense DNA or RNA) sequences into an animal to achieve expression of a polypeptide of the present invention. This method requires a polynucleotide which codes for a polypeptide of the invention that operatively linked to a promoter and any other genetic elements necessary for the expression of the polypeptide by the target tissue. Such gene therapy and delivery techniques are known in the art, see, for example, WO90\/11092, which is herein incorporated by reference.","Thus, for example, cells from a patient may be engineered with a polynucleotide (DNA or RNA) comprising a promoter operably linked to a polynucleotide of the invention ex vivo, with the engineered cells then being provided to a patient to be treated with the polypeptide. Such methods are well-known in the art. For example, see Belldegrun et al., J. Natl. Cancer Inst., 85:207-216 (1993); Ferrantini et al., Cancer Research, 53:107-1112 (1993); Ferrantini et al., J. Immunology 153: 4604-4615 (1994); Kaido, T., et al., Int. J. Cancer 60: 221-229 (1995); Ogura et al., Cancer Research 50: 5102-5106 (1990); Santodonato, et al., Human Gene Therapy 7:1-10 (1996); Santodonato, et al., Gene Therapy 4:1246-1255 (1997); and Zhang, et al., Cancer Gene Therapy 3: 31-38 (1996)), which are herein incorporated by reference. In one embodiment, the cells which are engineered are arterial cells. The arterial cells may be reintroduced into the patient through direct injection to the artery, the tissues surrounding the artery, or through catheter injection.","As discussed in more detail below, the polynucleotide constructs can be delivered by any method that delivers injectable materials to the cells of an animal, such as, injection into the interstitial space of tissues (heart, muscle, skin, lung, liver, and the like). The polynucleotide constructs may be delivered in a pharmaceutically acceptable liquid or aqueous carrier.","In one embodiment, the polynucleotide of the invention is delivered as a naked polynucleotide. The term \u201cnaked\u201d polynucleotide, DNA or RNA refers to sequences that are free from any delivery vehicle that acts to assist, promote or facilitate entry into the cell, including viral sequences, viral particles, liposome formulations, lipofectin or precipitating agents and the like. However, the polynucleotides of the invention can also be delivered in liposome formulations and lipofectin formulations and the like can be prepared by methods well known to those skilled in the art. Such methods are described, for example, in U.S. Pat. Nos. 5,593,972, 5,589,466, and 5,580,859, which are herein incorporated by reference.","The polynucleotide vector constructs of the invention used in the gene therapy method are preferably constructs that will not integrate into the host genome nor will they contain sequences that allow for replication. Appropriate vectors include pWLNEO, pSV2CAT, pOG44, pXT1 and pSG available from Stratagene; pSVK3, pBPV, pMSG and pSVL available from Pharmacia; and pEF1\/V5, pcDNA3.1, and pRc\/CMV2 available from Invitrogen. Other suitable vectors will be readily apparent to the skilled artisan.","Any strong promoter known to those skilled in the art can be used for driving the expression of polynucleotide sequence of the invention. Suitable promoters include adenoviral promoters, such as the adenoviral major late promoter; or heterologous promoters, such as the cytomegalovirus (CMV) promoter; the respiratory syncytial virus (RSV) promoter; inducible promoters, such as the MMT promoter, the metallothionein promoter; heat shock promoters; the albumin promoter; the ApoAI promoter; human globin promoters; viral thymidine kinase promoters, such as the Herpes Simplex thymidine kinase promoter; retroviral LTRs; the b-actin promoter; and human growth hormone promoters. The promoter also may be the native promoter for the polynucleotides of the invention.","Unlike other gene therapy techniques, one major advantage of introducing naked nucleic acid sequences into target cells is the transitory nature of the polynucleotide synthesis in the cells. Studies have shown that non-replicating DNA sequences can be introduced into cells to provide production of the desired polypeptide for periods of up to six months.","The polynucleotide construct of the invention can be delivered to the interstitial space of tissues within the an animal, including of muscle, skin, brain, lung, liver, spleen, bone marrow, thymus, heart, lymph, blood, bone, cartilage, pancreas, kidney, gall bladder, stomach, intestine, testis, ovary, uterus, rectum, nervous system, eye, gland, and connective tissue. Interstitial space of the tissues comprises the intercellular, fluid, mucopolysaccharide matrix among the reticular fibers of organ tissues, elastic fibers in the walls of vessels or chambers, collagen fibers of fibrous tissues, or that same matrix within connective tissue ensheathing muscle cells or in the lacunae of bone. It is similarly the space occupied by the plasma of the circulation and the lymph fluid of the lymphatic channels. Delivery to the interstitial space of muscle tissue is preferred for the reasons discussed below. They may be conveniently delivered by injection into the tissues comprising these cells. They are preferably delivered to and expressed in persistent, non-dividing cells which are differentiated, although delivery and expression may be achieved in non-differentiated or less completely differentiated cells, such as, for example, stem cells of blood or skin fibroblasts. In vivo muscle cells are particularly competent in their ability to take up and express polynucleotides.","For the naked nucleic acid sequence injection, an effective dosage amount of DNA or RNA will be in the range of from about 0.05 mg\/kg body weight to about 50 mg\/kg body weight. Preferably the dosage will be from about 0.005 mg\/kg to about 20 mg\/kg and more preferably from about 0.05 mg\/kg to about 5 mg\/kg. Of course, as the artisan of ordinary skill will appreciate, this dosage will vary according to the tissue site of injection. The appropriate and effective dosage of nucleic acid sequence can readily be determined by those of ordinary skill in the art and may depend on the condition being treated and the route of administration.","The preferred route of administration is by the parenteral route of injection into the interstitial space of tissues. However, other parenteral routes may also be used, such as, inhalation of an aerosol formulation particularly for delivery to lungs or bronchial tissues, throat or mucous membranes of the nose. In addition, naked DNA constructs can be delivered to arteries during angioplasty by the catheter used in the procedure.","The naked polynucleotides are delivered by any method known in the art, including, but not limited to, direct needle injection at the delivery site, intravenous injection, topical administration, catheter infusion, and so-called \u201cgene guns\u201d. These delivery methods are known in the art.","The constructs may also be delivered with delivery vehicles such as viral sequences, viral particles, liposome formulations, lipofectin, precipitating agents, etc. Such methods of delivery are known in the art.","In certain embodiments, the polynucleotide constructs of the invention are complexed in a liposome preparation. Liposomal preparations for use in the instant invention include cationic (positively charged), anionic (negatively charged) and neutral preparations. However, cationic liposomes are particularly preferred because a tight charge complex can be formed between the cationic liposome and the polyanionic nucleic acid. Cationic liposomes have been shown to mediate intracellular delivery of plasmid DNA (Felgner et al., Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. USA, 84:7413-7416 (1987), which is herein incorporated by reference); mRNA (Malone et al., Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. USA, 86:6077-6081 (1989), which is herein incorporated by reference); and purified transcription factors (Debs et al., J. Biol. Chem . . . , 265:10189-10192 (1990), which is herein incorporated by reference), in functional form.","Cationic liposomes are readily available. For example, N[1-2,3-dioleyloxy)propyl]-N,N,N-triethylammonium (DOTMA) liposomes are particularly useful and are available under the trademark Lipofectin, from GIBCO BRL, Grand Island, N.Y. (See, also, Felgner et al., Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. USA, 84:7413-7416 (1987), which is herein incorporated by reference). Other commercially available liposomes include transfectace (DDAB\/DOPE) and DOTAP\/DOPE (Boehringer).","Other cationic liposomes can be prepared from readily available materials using techniques well known in the art. See, e.g. PCT Publication NO: WO 90\/11092 (which is herein incorporated by reference) for a description of the synthesis of DOTAP (1,2-bis(oleoyloxy)-3-(trimethylammonio)propane) liposomes. Preparation of DOTMA liposomes is explained in the literature, see, e.g., Felgner et al., Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. USA, 84:7413-7417, which is herein incorporated by reference. Similar methods can be used to prepare liposomes from other cationic lipid materials.","Similarly, anionic and neutral liposomes are readily available, such as from Avanti Polar Lipids (Birmingham, Ala.), or can be easily prepared using readily available materials. Such materials include phosphatidyl, choline, cholesterol, phosphatidyl ethanolamine, dioleoylphosphatidyl choline (DOPC), dioleoylphosphatidyl glycerol (DOPG), dioleoylphoshatidyl ethanolamine (DOPE), among others. These materials can also be mixed with the DOTMA and DOTAP starting materials in appropriate ratios. Methods for making liposomes using these materials are well known in the art.","For example, commercially dioleoylphosphatidyl choline (DOPC), dioleoylphosphatidyl glycerol (DOPG), and dioleoylphosphatidyl ethanolamine (DOPE) can be used in various combinations to make conventional liposomes, with or without the addition of cholesterol. Thus, for example, DOPG\/DOPC vesicles can be prepared by drying 50 mg each of DOPG and DOPC under a stream of nitrogen gas into a sonication vial. The sample is placed under a vacuum pump overnight and is hydrated the following day with deionized water. The sample is then sonicated for 2 hours in a capped vial, using a Heat Systems model 350 sonicator equipped with an inverted cup (bath type) probe at the maximum setting while the bath is circulated at 15EC. Alternatively, negatively charged vesicles can be prepared without sonication to produce multilamellar vesicles or by extrusion through nucleopore membranes to produce unilamellar vesicles of discrete size. Other methods are known and available to those of skill in the art.","The liposomes can comprise multilamellar vesicles (MLVs), small unilamellar vesicles (SUVs), or large unilamellar vesicles (LUVs), with SUVs being preferred. The various liposome-nucleic acid complexes are prepared using methods well known in the art. See, e.g., Straubinger et al., Methods of Immunology, 101:512-527 (1983), which is herein incorporated by reference. For example, MLVs containing nucleic acid can be prepared by depositing a thin film of phospholipid on the walls of a glass tube and subsequently hydrating with a solution of the material to be encapsulated. SUVs are prepared by extended sonication of MLVs to produce a homogeneous population of unilamellar liposomes. The material to be entrapped is added to a suspension of preformed MLVs and then sonicated. When using liposomes containing cationic lipids, the dried lipid film is resuspended in an appropriate solution such as sterile water or an isotonic buffer solution such as 10 mM Tris\/NaCl, sonicated, and then the preformed liposomes are mixed directly with the DNA. The liposome and DNA form a very stable complex due to binding of the positively charged liposomes to the cationic DNA. SUVs find use with small nucleic acid fragments. LUVs are prepared by a number of methods, well known in the art. Commonly used methods include Ca2+-EDTA chelation (Papahadjopoulos et al., Biochim. Biophys. Acta, 394:483 (1975); Wilson et al., Cell, 17:77 (1979)); ether injection (Deamer et al., Biochim. Biophys. Acta, 443:629 (1976); Ostro et al., Biochem. Biophys. Res.

Preferably, the ration will be from about 5:1 to about 1:5. More preferably, the ration will be about 3:1 to about 1:3. Still more preferably, the ratio will be about 1:1.","U.S. Pat. No. 5,676,954 (which is herein incorporated by reference) reports on the injection of genetic material, complexed with cationic liposomes carriers, into mice. U.S. Pat. Nos. 4,897,355, 4,946,787, 5,049,386, 5,459,127, 5,589,466, 5,693,622, 5,580,859, 5,703,055, and international publication NO: WO 94\/9469 (which are herein incorporated by reference) provide cationic lipids for use in transfecting DNA into cells and mammals. U.S. Pat. Nos. 5,589,466, 5,693,622, 5,580,859, 5,703,055, and international publication NO: WO 94\/9469 (which are herein incorporated by reference) provide methods for delivering DNA-cationic lipid complexes to mammals.","In certain embodiments, cells are engineered, ex vivo or in vivo, using a retroviral particle containing RNA which comprises a sequence encoding polypeptides of the invention. Retroviruses from which the retroviral plasmid vectors may be derived include, but are not limited to, Moloney Murine Leukemia Virus, spleen necrosis virus, Rous sarcoma Virus, Harvey Sarcoma Virus, avian leukosis virus, gibbon ape leukemia virus, human immunodeficiency virus, Myeloproliferative Sarcoma Virus, and mammary tumor virus.","The retroviral plasmid vector is employed to transduce packaging cell lines to form producer cell lines. Examples of packaging cells which may be transfected include, but are not limited to, the PE501, PA317, R-2, R-AM, PA12, T19-14X, VT-19-17-H2, RCRE, RCRIP, GP+E-86, GP+envAm12, and DAN cell lines as described in Miller, Human Gene Therapy, 1:5-14 (1990), which is incorporated herein by reference in its entirety. The vector may transduce the packaging cells through any means known in the art. Such means include, but are not limited to, electroporation, the use of liposomes, and CaPO4 precipitation. In one alternative, the retroviral plasmid vector may be encapsulated into a liposome, or coupled to a lipid, and then administered to a host.","The producer cell line generates infectious retroviral vector particles which include polynucleotide encoding polypeptides of the invention. Such retroviral vector particles then may be employed, to transduce eukaryotic cells, either in vitro or in vivo. The transduced eukaryotic cells will express polypeptides of the invention.","In certain other embodiments, cells are engineered, ex vivo or in vivo, with polynucleotides of the invention contained in an adenovirus vector. Adenovirus can be manipulated such that it encodes and expresses polypeptides of the invention, and at the same time is inactivated in terms of its ability to replicate in a normal lytic viral life cycle. Adenovirus expression is achieved without integration of the viral DNA into the host cell chromosome, thereby alleviating concerns about insertional mutagenesis. Furthermore, adenoviruses have been used as live enteric vaccines for many years with an excellent safety profile (Schwartz et al., Am. Rev. Respir. Dis., 109:233-238 (1974)). Finally, adenovirus mediated gene transfer has been demonstrated in a number of instances including transfer of alpha-1-antitrypsin and CFTR to the lungs of cotton rats (Rosenfeld et al., Science, 252:431-434 (1991); Rosenfeld et al., Cell, 68:143-155 (1992)). Furthermore, extensive studies to attempt to establish adenovirus as a causative agent in human cancer were uniformly negative (Green et al. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. USA, 76:6606 (1979)).","Suitable adenoviral vectors useful in the present invention are described, for example, in Kozarsky and Wilson, Curr. Opin. Genet. Devel., 3:499-503 (1993); Rosenfeld et al., Cell, 68:143-155 (1992); Engelhardt et al., Human Genet. Ther., 4:759-769 (1993); Yang et al., Nature Genet., 7:362-369 (1994); Wilson et al., Nature 365:691-692 (1993); and U.S. Pat. No. 5,652,224, which are herein incorporated by reference. For example, the adenovirus vector Ad2 is useful and can be grown in human 293 cells. These cells contain the E1 region of adenovirus and constitutively express E1a and E1b, which complement the defective adenoviruses by providing the products of the genes deleted from the vector. In addition to Ad2, other varieties of adenovirus (e.g., Ad3, Ad5, and Ad7) are also useful in the present invention.","Preferably, the adenoviruses used in the present invention are replication deficient. Replication deficient adenoviruses require the aid of a helper virus and\/or packaging cell line to form infectious particles. The resulting virus is capable of infecting cells and can express a polynucleotide of interest which is operably linked to a promoter, but cannot replicate in most cells. Replication deficient adenoviruses may be deleted in one or more of all or a portion of the following genes: E1a, E1b, E3, E4, E2a, or L1 through L5.","In certain other embodiments, the cells are engineered, ex vivo or in vivo, using an adeno-associated virus (AAV). AAVs are naturally occurring defective viruses that require helper viruses to produce infectious particles (Muzyczka, Curr. Topics in Microbiol. Immunol., 158:97 (1992)). It is also one of the few viruses that may integrate its DNA into non-dividing cells. Vectors containing as little as 300 base pairs of AAV can be packaged and can integrate, but space for exogenous DNA is limited to about 4.5 kb. Methods for producing and using such AAVs are known in the art. See, for example, U.S. Pat. Nos. 5,139,941, 5,173,414, 5,354,678, 5,436,146, 5,474,935, 5,478,745, and 5,589,377.","For example, an appropriate AAV vector for use in the present invention will include all the sequences necessary for DNA replication, encapsidation, and host-cell integration. The polynucleotide construct containing polynucleotides of the invention is inserted into the AAV vector using standard cloning methods, such as those found in Sambrook et al., Molecular Cloning: A Laboratory Manual, Cold Spring Harbor Press (1989). The recombinant AAV vector is then transfected into packaging cells which are infected with a helper virus, using any standard technique, including lipofection, electroporation, calcium phosphate precipitation, etc. Appropriate helper viruses include adenoviruses, cytomegaloviruses, vaccinia viruses, or herpes viruses. Once the packaging cells are transfected and infected, they will produce infectious AAV viral particles which contain the polynucleotide construct of the invention. These viral particles are then used to transduce eukaryotic cells, either ex vivo or in vivo. The transduced cells will contain the polynucleotide construct integrated into its genome, and will express the desired gene product.","Another method of gene therapy involves operably associating heterologous control regions and endogenous polynucleotide sequences (e.g. encoding the polypeptide sequence of interest) via homologous recombination (see, e.g., U.S. Pat. No. 5,641,670, issued Jun. 24, 1997; International Publication NO: WO 96\/29411, published Sep. 26, 1996; International Publication NO: WO 94\/12650, published Aug. 4, 1994; Koller et al., Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. USA, 86:8932-8935 (1989); and Zijlstra et al., Nature, 342:435-438 (1989). This method involves the activation of a gene which is present in the target cells, but which is not normally expressed in the cells, or is expressed at a lower level than desired.","Polynucleotide constructs are made, using standard techniques known in the art, which contain the promoter with targeting sequences flanking the promoter. Suitable promoters are described herein. The targeting sequence is sufficiently complementary to an endogenous sequence to permit homologous recombination of the promoter-targeting sequence with the endogenous sequence. The targeting sequence will be sufficiently near the 5\u2032 end of the desired endogenous polynucleotide sequence so the promoter will be operably linked to the endogenous sequence upon homologous recombination.","The promoter and the targeting sequences can be amplified using PCR. Preferably, the amplified promoter contains distinct restriction enzyme sites on the 5\u2032 and 3\u2032 ends. Preferably, the 3\u2032 end of the first targeting sequence contains the same restriction enzyme site as the 5\u2032 end of the amplified promoter and the 5\u2032 end of the second targeting sequence contains the same restriction site as the 3\u2032 end of the amplified promoter. The amplified promoter and targeting sequences are digested and ligated together.","The promoter-targeting sequence construct is delivered to the cells, either as naked polynucleotide, or in conjunction with transfection-facilitating agents, such as liposomes, viral sequences, viral particles, whole viruses, lipofection, precipitating agents, etc., described in more detail above. The P promoter-targeting sequence can be delivered by any method, included direct needle injection, intravenous injection, topical administration, catheter infusion, particle accelerators, etc. The methods are described in more detail below.","The promoter-targeting sequence construct is taken up by cells. Homologous recombination between the construct and the endogenous sequence takes place, such that an endogenous sequence is placed under the control of the promoter. The promoter then drives the expression of the endogenous sequence.","The polynucleotides encoding polypeptides of the present invention may be administered along with other polynucleotides encoding angiogenic proteins. Angiogenic proteins include, but are not limited to, acidic and basic fibroblast growth factors, VEGF-1, VEGF-2 (VEGF-C), VEGF-3 (VEGF-B), epidermal growth factor alpha and beta, platelet-derived endothelial cell growth factor, platelet-derived growth factor, tumor necrosis factor alpha, hepatocyte growth factor, insulin like growth factor, colony stimulating factor, macrophage colony stimulating factor, granulocyte\/macrophage colony stimulating factor, and nitric oxide synthase.","Preferably, the polynucleotide encoding a polypeptide of the invention contains a secretory signal sequence that facilitates secretion of the protein. Typically, the signal sequence is positioned in the coding region of the polynucleotide to be expressed towards or at the 5\u2032 end of the coding region. The signal sequence may be homologous or heterologous to the polynucleotide of interest and may be homologous or heterologous to the cells to be transfected. Additionally, the signal sequence may be chemically synthesized using methods known in the art.","Any mode of administration of any of the above-described polynucleotides constructs can be used so long as the mode results in the expression of one or more molecules in an amount sufficient to provide a therapeutic effect. This includes direct needle injection, systemic injection, catheter infusion, biolistic injectors, particle accelerators (i.e., \u201cgene guns\u201d), gelfoam sponge depots, other commercially available depot materials, osmotic pumps (e.g., Alza minipumps), oral or suppositorial solid (tablet or pill) pharmaceutical formulations, and decanting or topical applications during surgery. For example, direct injection of naked calcium phosphate-precipitated plasmid into rat liver and rat spleen or a protein-coated plasmid into the portal vein has resulted in gene expression of the foreign gene in the rat livers. (Kaneda et al., Science, 243:375 (1989)).","A preferred method of local administration is by direct injection. Preferably, a recombinant molecule of the present invention complexed with a delivery vehicle is administered by direct injection into or locally within the area of arteries. Administration of a composition locally within the area of arteries refers to injecting the composition centimeters and preferably, millimeters within arteries.","Another method of local administration is to contact a polynucleotide construct of the present invention in or around a surgical wound. For example, a patient can undergo surgery and the polynucleotide construct can be coated on the surface of tissue inside the wound or the construct can be injected into areas of tissue inside the wound.","Therapeutic compositions useful in systemic administration, include recombinant molecules of the present invention complexed to a targeted delivery vehicle of the present invention. Suitable delivery vehicles for use with systemic administration comprise liposomes comprising ligands for targeting the vehicle to a particular site.","Preferred methods of systemic administration, include intravenous injection, aerosol, oral and percutaneous (topical) delivery. Intravenous injections can be performed using methods standard in the art. Aerosol delivery can also be performed using methods standard in the art (see, for example, Stribling et al., Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. USA, 189:11277-11281 (1992), which is incorporated herein by reference). Oral delivery can be performed by complexing a polynucleotide construct of the present invention to a carrier capable of withstanding degradation by digestive enzymes in the gut of an animal. Examples of such carriers, include plastic capsules or tablets, such as those known in the art. Topical delivery can be performed by mixing a polynucleotide construct of the present invention with a lipophilic reagent (e.g., DMSO) that is capable of passing into the skin.","Determining an effective amount of substance to be delivered can depend upon a number of factors including, for example, the chemical structure and biological activity of the substance, the age and weight of the animal, the precise condition requiring treatment and its severity, and the route of administration. The frequency of treatments depends upon a number of factors, such as the amount of polynucleotide constructs administered per dose, as well as the health and history of the subject. The precise amount, number of doses, and timing of doses will be determined by the attending physician or veterinarian. Therapeutic compositions of the present invention can be administered to any animal, preferably to mammals and birds. Preferred mammals include humans, dogs, cats, mice, rats, rabbits sheep, cattle, horses and pigs, with humans being particularly preferred.","The polynucleotides or polypeptides, or agonists or antagonists of the present invention can be used in assays to test for one or more biological activities. If these polynucleotides and polypeptides do exhibit activity in a particular assay, it is likely that these molecules may be involved in the diseases associated with the biological activity. Thus, the polynucleotides or polypeptides, or agonists or antagonists could be used to treat the associated disease.","The polynucleotides or polypeptides, or agonists or antagonists of the present invention may be useful in treating, preventing, and\/or diagnosing diseases, disorders, and\/or conditions of the immune system, by activating or inhibiting the proliferation, differentiation, or mobilization (chemotaxis) of immune cells. Immune cells develop through a process called hematopoiesis, producing myeloid (platelets, red blood cells, neutrophils, and macrophages) and lymphoid (B and T lymphocytes) cells from pluripotent stem cells. The etiology of these immune diseases, disorders, and\/or conditions may be genetic, somatic, such as cancer or some autoimmune diseases, disorders, and\/or conditions, acquired (e.g., by chemotherapy or toxins), or infectious. Moreover, a polynucleotides or polypeptides, or agonists or antagonists of the present invention can be used as a marker or detector of a particular immune system disease or disorder.","A polynucleotides or polypeptides, or agonists or antagonists of the present invention may be useful in treating, preventing, and\/or diagnosing diseases, disorders, and\/or conditions of hematopoietic cells. A polynucleotides or polypeptides, or agonists or antagonists of the present invention could be used to increase differentiation and proliferation of hematopoietic cells, including the pluripotent stem cells, in an effort to treat or prevent those diseases, disorders, and\/or conditions associated with a decrease in certain (or many) types hematopoietic cells. Examples of immunologic deficiency syndromes include, but are not limited to: blood protein diseases, disorders, and\/or conditions (e.g. agammaglobulinemia, dysgammaglobulinemia), ataxia telangiectasia, common variable immunodeficiency, Digeorge Syndrome, HIV infection, HTLV-BLV infection, leukocyte adhesion deficiency syndrome, lymphopenia, phagocyte bactericidal dysfunction, severe combined immunodeficiency (SCIDs), Wiskott-Aldrich Disorder, anemia, thrombocytopenia, or hemoglobinuria.","Moreover, a polynucleotides or polypeptides, or agonists or antagonists of the present invention could also be used to modulate hemostatic (the stopping of bleeding) or thrombolytic activity (clot formation). For example, by increasing hemostatic or thrombolytic activity, a polynucleotides or polypeptides, or agonists or antagonists of the present invention could be used to treat or prevent blood coagulation diseases, disorders, and\/or conditions (e.g., afibrinogenemia, factor deficiencies), blood platelet diseases, disorders, and\/or conditions (e.g. thrombocytopenia), or wounds resulting from trauma, surgery, or other causes. Alternatively, a polynucleotides or polypeptides, or agonists or antagonists of the present invention that can decrease hemostatic or thrombolytic activity could be used to inhibit or dissolve clotting. These molecules could be important in the treatment or prevention of heart attacks (infarction), strokes, or scarring.","A polynucleotides or polypeptides, or agonists or antagonists of the present invention may also be useful in treating, preventing, and\/or diagnosing autoimmune diseases, disorders, and\/or conditions. Many autoimmune diseases, disorders, and\/or conditions result from inappropriate recognition of self as foreign material by immune cells. This inappropriate recognition results in an immune response leading to the destruction of the host tissue. Therefore, the administration of a polynucleotides or polypeptides, or agonists or antagonists of the present invention that inhibits an immune response, particularly the proliferation, differentiation, or chemotaxis of T-cells, may be an effective therapy in preventing autoimmune diseases, disorders, and\/or conditions.","Examples of autoimmune diseases, disorders, and\/or conditions that can be treated, prevented, and\/or diagnosed or detected by the present invention include, but are not limited to: Addison's Disease, hemolytic anemia, antiphospholipid syndrome, rheumatoid arthritis, dermatitis, allergic encephalomyelitis, glomerulonephritis, Goodpasture's Syndrome, Graves' Disease, Multiple Sclerosis, Myasthenia Gravis, Neuritis, Ophthalmia, Bullous Pemphigoid, Pemphigus, Polyendocrinopathies, Purpura, Reiter's Disease, Stiff-Man Syndrome, Autoimmune Thyroiditis, Systemic Lupus Erythematosus, Autoimmune Pulmonary Inflammation, Guillain-Barre Syndrome, insulin dependent diabetes mellitis, and autoimmune inflammatory eye disease.","Similarly, allergic reactions and conditions, such as asthma (particularly allergic asthma) or other respiratory problems, may also be treated, prevented, and\/or diagnosed by polynucleotides or polypeptides, or agonists or antagonists of the present invention. Moreover, these molecules can be used to treat anaphylaxis, hypersensitivity to an antigenic molecule, or blood group incompatibility.","A polynucleotides or polypeptides, or agonists or antagonists of the present invention may also be used to treat, prevent, and\/or diagnose organ rejection or graft-versus-host disease (GVHD). Organ rejection occurs by host immune cell destruction of the transplanted tissue through an immune response. Similarly, an immune response is also involved in GVHD, but, in this case, the foreign transplanted immune cells destroy the host tissues. The administration of a polynucleotides or polypeptides, or agonists or antagonists of the present invention that inhibits an immune response, particularly the proliferation, differentiation, or chemotaxis of T-cells, may be an effective therapy in preventing organ rejection or GVHD.","Similarly, a polynucleotides or polypeptides, or agonists or antagonists of the present invention may also be used to modulate inflammation. For example, the polypeptide or polynucleotide or agonists or antagonist may inhibit the proliferation and differentiation of cells involved in an inflammatory response. These molecules can be used to treat, prevent, and\/or diagnose inflammatory conditions, both chronic and acute conditions, including chronic prostatitis, granulomatous prostatitis and malacoplakia, inflammation associated with infection (e.g., septic shock, sepsis, or systemic inflammatory response syndrome (SIRS)), ischemia-reperfusion injury, endotoxin lethality, arthritis, complement-mediated hyperacute rejection, nephritis, cytokine or chemokine induced lung injury, inflammatory bowel disease, Crohn's disease, or resulting from over production of cytokines (e.g., TNF or IL-1.)","A polynucleotides or polypeptides, or agonists or antagonists of the invention can be used to treat, prevent, and\/or diagnose hyperproliferative diseases, disorders, and\/or conditions, including neoplasms. A polynucleotides or polypeptides, or agonists or antagonists of the present invention may inhibit the proliferation of the disorder through direct or indirect interactions. Alternatively, a polynucleotides or polypeptides, or agonists or antagonists of the present invention may proliferate other cells which can inhibit the hyperproliferative disorder.","For example, by increasing an immune response, particularly increasing antigenic qualities of the hyperproliferative disorder or by proliferating, differentiating, or mobilizing T-cells, hyperproliferative diseases, disorders, and\/or conditions can be treated, prevented, and\/or diagnosed. This immune response may be increased by either enhancing an existing immune response, or by initiating a new immune response. Alternatively, decreasing an immune response may also be a method of treating, preventing, and\/or diagnosing hyperproliferative diseases, disorders, and\/or conditions, such as a chemotherapeutic agent.","Examples of hyperproliferative diseases, disorders, and\/or conditions that can be treated, prevented, and\/or diagnosed by polynucleotides or polypeptides, or agonists or antagonists of the present invention include, but are not limited to neoplasms located in the: colon, abdomen, bone, breast, digestive system, liver, pancreas, peritoneum, endocrine glands (adrenal, parathyroid, pituitary, testicles, ovary, thymus, thyroid), eye, head and neck, nervous (central and peripheral), lymphatic system, pelvic, skin, soft tissue, spleen, thoracic, and urogenital.","Similarly, other hyperproliferative diseases, disorders, and\/or conditions can also be treated, prevented, and\/or diagnosed by a polynucleotides or polypeptides, or agonists or antagonists of the present invention. Examples of such hyperproliferative diseases, disorders, and\/or conditions include, but are not limited to: hypergammaglobulinemia, lymphoproliferative diseases, disorders, and\/or conditions, paraproteinemias, purpura, sarcoidosis, Sezary Syndrome, Waldenstron's Macroglobulinemia, Gaucher's Disease, histiocytosis, and any other hyperproliferative disease, besides neoplasia, located in an organ system listed above.","One preferred embodiment utilizes polynucleotides of the present invention to inhibit aberrant cellular division, by gene therapy using the present invention, and\/or protein fusions or fragments thereof.","Thus, the present invention provides a method for treating or preventing cell proliferative diseases, disorders, and\/or conditions by inserting into an abnormally proliferating cell a polynucleotide of the present invention, wherein said polynucleotide represses said expression.","Another embodiment of the present invention provides a method of treating or preventing cell-proliferative diseases, disorders, and\/or conditions in individuals comprising administration of one or more active gene copies of the present invention to an abnormally proliferating cell or cells. In a preferred embodiment, polynucleotides of the present invention is a DNA construct comprising a recombinant expression vector effective in expressing a DNA sequence encoding said polynucleotides. In another preferred embodiment of the present invention, the DNA construct encoding the polynucleotides of the present invention is inserted into cells to be treated utilizing a retrovirus, or more Preferably an adenoviral vector (See G J. Nabel, et. al., PNAS 1999 96: 324-326, which is hereby incorporated by reference). In a most preferred embodiment, the viral vector is defective and will not transform non-proliferating cells, only proliferating cells. Moreover, in a preferred embodiment, the polynucleotides of the present invention inserted into proliferating cells either alone, or in combination with or fused to other polynucleotides, can then be modulated via an external stimulus (i.e. magnetic, specific small molecule, chemical, or drug administration, etc.), which acts upon the promoter upstream of said polynucleotides to induce expression of the encoded protein product. As such the beneficial therapeutic affect of the present invention may be expressly modulated (i.e. to increase, decrease, or inhibit expression of the present invention) based upon said external stimulus.","Polynucleotides of the present invention may be useful in repressing expression of oncogenic genes or antigens. By \u201crepressing expression of the oncogenic genes\u201d is intended the suppression of the transcription of the gene, the degradation of the gene transcript (pre-message RNA), the inhibition of splicing, the destruction of the messenger RNA, the prevention of the post-translational modifications of the protein, the destruction of the protein, or the inhibition of the normal function of the protein.","For local administration to abnormally proliferating cells, polynucleotides of the present invention may be administered by any method known to those of skill in the art including, but not limited to transfection, electroporation, microinjection of cells, or in vehicles such as liposomes, lipofectin, or as naked polynucleotides, or any other method described throughout the specification. The polynucleotide of the present invention may be delivered by known gene delivery systems such as, but not limited to, retroviral vectors (Gilboa, J. Virology 44:845 (1982); Hocke, Nature 320:275 (1986); Wilson, et al., Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U.S.A. 85:3014), vaccinia virus system (Chakrabarty et al., Mol. Cell Biol. 5:3403 (1985) or other efficient DNA delivery systems (Yates et al., Nature 313:812 (1985)) known to those skilled in the art. These references are exemplary only and are hereby incorporated by reference. In order to specifically deliver or transfect cells which are abnormally proliferating and spare non-dividing cells, it is preferable to utilize a retrovirus, or adenoviral (as described in the art and elsewhere herein) delivery system known to those of skill in the art. Since host DNA replication is required for retroviral DNA to integrate and the retrovirus will be unable to self replicate due to the lack of the retrovirus genes needed for its life cycle. Utilizing such a retroviral delivery system for polynucleotides of the present invention will target said gene and constructs to abnormally proliferating cells and will spare the non-dividing normal cells.","The polynucleotides of the present invention may be delivered directly to cell proliferative disorder\/disease sites in internal organs, body cavities and the like by use of imaging devices used to guide an injecting needle directly to the disease site. The polynucleotides of the present invention may also be administered to disease sites at the time of surgical intervention.","By \u201ccell proliferative disease\u201d is meant any human or animal disease or disorder, affecting any one or any combination of organs, cavities, or body parts, which is characterized by single or multiple local abnormal proliferations of cells, groups of cells, or tissues, whether benign or malignant.","Any amount of the polynucleotides of the present invention may be administered as long as it has a biologically inhibiting effect on the proliferation of the treated cells. Moreover, it is possible to administer more than one of the polynucleotide of the present invention simultaneously to the same site. By \u201cbiologically inhibiting\u201d is meant partial or total growth inhibition as well as decreases in the rate of proliferation or growth of the cells. The biologically inhibitory dose may be determined by assessing the effects of the polynucleotides of the present invention on target malignant or abnormally proliferating cell growth in tissue culture, tumor growth in animals and cell cultures, or any other method known to one of ordinary skill in the art.","The present invention is further directed to antibody-based therapies which involve administering of anti-polypeptides and anti-polynucleotide antibodies to a mammalian, preferably human, patient for treating, preventing, and\/or diagnosing one or more of the described diseases, disorders, and\/or conditions. Methods for producing anti-polypeptides and anti-polynucleotide antibodies polyclonal and monoclonal antibodies are described in detail elsewhere herein. Such antibodies may be provided in pharmaceutically acceptable compositions as known in the art or as described herein.","A summary of the ways in which the antibodies of the present invention may be used therapeutically includes binding polynucleotides or polypeptides of the present invention locally or systemically in the body or by direct cytotoxicity of the antibody, e.g. as mediated by complement (CDC) or by effector cells (ADCC). Some of these approaches are described in more detail below. Armed with the teachings provided herein, one of ordinary skill in the art will know how to use the antibodies of the present invention for diagnostic, monitoring or therapeutic purposes without undue experimentation.","In particular, the antibodies, fragments and derivatives of the present invention are useful for treating, preventing, and\/or diagnosing a subject having or developing cell proliferative and\/or differentiation diseases, disorders, and\/or conditions as described herein. Such treatment comprises administering a single or multiple doses of the antibody, or a fragment, derivative, or a conjugate thereof.","The antibodies of this invention may be advantageously utilized in combination with other monoclonal or chimeric antibodies, or with lymphokines or hematopoietic growth factors, for example, which serve to increase the number or activity of effector cells which interact with the antibodies.","It is preferred to use high affinity and\/or potent in vivo inhibiting and\/or neutralizing antibodies against polypeptides or polynucleotides of the present invention, fragments or regions thereof, for both immunoassays directed to and therapy of diseases, disorders, and\/or conditions related to polynucleotides or polypeptides, including fragments thereof, of the present invention. Such antibodies, fragments, or regions, will preferably have an affinity for polynucleotides or polypeptides, including fragments thereof. Preferred binding affinities include those with a dissociation constant or Kd less than 5\u00d710\u22126M, 10\u22126M, 5\u00d710\u22127M, 10\u22127M, 5\u00d710\u22128M, 10\u22128M, 5\u00d710\u22129M, 10\u22129M, 5\u00d710\u221210M, 10\u221210M, 5\u00d710\u221211M, 10\u221211M, 5\u00d710\u221212M, 10\u221212M, 5\u00d710\u221213M, 10\u221213M, 5\u00d710\u221214M, 10\u221214M, 5\u00d710\u221215M, and 10\u221215M.","Moreover, polypeptides of the present invention may be useful in inhibiting the angiogenesis of proliferative cells or tissues, either alone, as a protein fusion, or in combination with other polypeptides directly or indirectly, as described elsewhere herein. In a most preferred embodiment, said anti-angiogenesis effect may be achieved indirectly, for example, through the inhibition of hematopoietic, tumor-specific cells, such as tumor-associated macrophages (See Joseph I B, et al. J Natl Cancer Inst, 90(21):1648-53 (1998), which is hereby incorporated by reference). Antibodies directed to polypeptides or polynucleotides of the present invention may also result in inhibition of angiogenesis directly, or indirectly (See Witte L, et al., Cancer Metastasis Rev. 17(2):155-61 (1998), which is hereby incorporated by reference)).","Polypeptides, including protein fusions, of the present invention, or fragments thereof may be useful in inhibiting proliferative cells or tissues through the induction of apoptosis.

Tissue React. 20(1):3-15 (1998), which are all hereby incorporated by reference).","Polypeptides, including protein fusions to, or fragments thereof, of the present invention are useful in inhibiting the metastasis of proliferative cells or tissues.

Such methods are known in the art. Polypeptides of the invention may be administered as part of a Therapeutic, described in more detail below. Methods of delivering polynucleotides of the invention are described in more detail herein.","The naturally occurring balance between endogenous stimulators and inhibitors of angiogenesis is one in which inhibitory influences predominate. Rastinejad et al., Cell 56:345-355 (1989). In those rare instances in which neovascularization occurs under normal physiological conditions, such as wound healing, organ regeneration, embryonic development, and female reproductive processes, angiogenesis is stringently regulated and spatially and temporally delimited. Under conditions of pathological angiogenesis such as that characterizing solid tumor growth, these regulatory controls fail. Unregulated angiogenesis becomes pathologic and sustains progression of many neoplastic and non-neoplastic diseases. A number of serious diseases are dominated by abnormal neovascularization including solid tumor growth and metastases, arthritis, some types of eye diseases, disorders, and\/or conditions, and psoriasis. See, e.g., reviews by Moses et al., Biotech. 9:630-634 (1991); Folkman et al., N. Engl. J. Med., 333:1757-1763 (1995); Auerbach et al., J. Microvasc. Res. 29:401-411 (1985); Folkman, Advances in Cancer Research, eds. Klein and Weinhouse, Academic Press, New York, pp. 175-203 (1985); Patz, Am. J. Opthalmol. 94:715-743 (1982); and Folkman et al., Science 221:719-725 (1983). In a number of pathological conditions, the process of angiogenesis contributes to the disease state. For example, significant data have accumulated which suggest that the growth of solid tumors is dependent on angiogenesis. Folkman and Klagsbrun, Science 235:442-447 (1987).","The present invention provides for treatment of diseases, disorders, and\/or conditions associated with neovascularization by administration of the polynucleotides and\/or polypeptides of the invention, as well as agonists or antagonists of the present invention. Malignant and metastatic conditions which can be treated with the polynucleotides and polypeptides, or agonists or antagonists of the invention include, but are not limited to, malignancies, solid tumors, and cancers described herein and otherwise known in the art (for a review of such disorders, see Fishman et al., Medicine, 2d Ed., J. B. Lippincott Co., Philadelphia (1985)). Thus, the present invention provides a method of treating, preventing, and\/or diagnosing an angiogenesis-related disease and\/or disorder, comprising administering to an individual in need thereof a therapeutically effective amount of a polynucleotide, polypeptide, antagonist and\/or agonist of the invention. For example, polynucleotides, polypeptides, antagonists and\/or agonists may be utilized in a variety of additional methods in order to therapeutically treat or prevent a cancer or tumor. Cancers which may be treated, prevented, and\/or diagnosed with polynucleotides, polypeptides, antagonists and\/or agonists include, but are not limited to solid tumors, including prostate, lung, breast, ovarian, stomach, pancreas, larynx, esophagus, testes, liver, parotid, biliary tract, colon, rectum, cervix, uterus, endometrium, kidney, bladder, thyroid cancer; primary tumors and metastases; melanomas; glioblastoma; Kaposi's sarcoma; leiomyosarcoma; non-small cell lung cancer; colorectal cancer; advanced malignancies; and blood born tumors such as leukemias. For example, polynucleotides, polypeptides, antagonists and\/or agonists may be delivered topically, in order to treat or prevent cancers such as skin cancer, head and neck tumors, breast tumors, and Kaposi's sarcoma.","Within yet other aspects, polynucleotides, polypeptides, antagonists and\/or agonists may be utilized to treat superficial forms of bladder cancer by, for example, intravesical administration. Polynucleotides, polypeptides, antagonists and\/or agonists may be delivered directly into the tumor, or near the tumor site, via injection or a catheter. Of course, as the artisan of ordinary skill will appreciate, the appropriate mode of administration will vary according to the cancer to be treated. Other modes of delivery are discussed herein.","Polynucleotides, polypeptides, antagonists and\/or agonists may be useful in treating, preventing, and\/or diagnosing other diseases, disorders, and\/or conditions, besides cancers, which involve angiogenesis. These diseases, disorders, and\/or conditions include, but are not limited to: benign tumors, for example hemangiomas, acoustic neuromas, neurofibromas, trachomas, and pyogenic granulomas; artheroscleric plaques; ocular angiogenic diseases, for example, diabetic retinopathy, retinopathy of prematurity, macular degeneration, corneal graft rejection, neovascular glaucoma, retrolental fibroplasia, rubeosis, retinoblastoma, uvietis and Pterygia (abnormal blood vessel growth) of the eye; rheumatoid arthritis; psoriasis; delayed wound healing; endometriosis; vasculogenesis; granulations; hypertrophic scars (keloids); nonunion fractures; scleroderma; trachoma; vascular adhesions; myocardial angiogenesis; coronary collaterals; cerebral collaterals; arteriovenous malformations; ischemic limb angiogenesis; Osler-Webber Syndrome; plaque neovascularization; telangiectasia; hemophiliac joints; angiofibroma; fibromuscular dysplasia; wound granulation; Crohn's disease; and atherosclerosis.","For example, within one aspect of the present invention methods are provided for treating, preventing, and\/or diagnosing hypertrophic scars and keloids, comprising the step of administering a polynucleotide, polypeptide, antagonist and\/or agonist of the invention to a hypertrophic scar or keloid.","Within one embodiment of the present invention polynucleotides, polypeptides, antagonists and\/or agonists are directly injected into a hypertrophic scar or keloid, in order to prevent the progression of these lesions. This therapy is of particular value in the prophylactic treatment of conditions which are known to result in the development of hypertrophic scars and keloids (e.g., burns), and is preferably initiated after the proliferative phase has had time to progress (approximately 14 days after the initial injury), but before hypertrophic scar or keloid development. As noted above, the present invention also provides methods for treating, preventing, and\/or diagnosing neovascular diseases of the eye, including for example, corneal neovascularization, neovascular glaucoma, proliferative diabetic retinopathy, retrolental fibroplasia and macular degeneration.","Moreover, Ocular diseases, disorders, and\/or conditions associated with neovascularization which can be treated, prevented, and\/or diagnosed with the polynucleotides and polypeptides of the present invention (including agonists and\/or antagonists) include, but are not limited to: neovascular glaucoma, diabetic retinopathy, retinoblastoma, retrolental fibroplasia, uveitis, retinopathy of prematurity macular degeneration, corneal graft neovascularization, as well as other eye inflammatory diseases, ocular tumors and diseases associated with choroidal or iris neovascularization. See, e.g., reviews by Waltman et al., Am. J. Ophthal. 85:704-710 (1978) and Gartner et al., Surv. Ophthal. 22:291-312 (1978).","Thus, within one aspect of the present invention methods are provided for treating or preventing neovascular diseases of the eye such as corneal neovascularization (including corneal graft neovascularization), comprising the step of administering to a patient a therapeutically effective amount of a compound (as described above) to the cornea, such that the formation of blood vessels is inhibited. Briefly, the cornea is a tissue which normally lacks blood vessels. In certain pathological conditions however, capillaries may extend into the cornea from the pericorneal vascular plexus of the limbus. When the cornea becomes vascularized, it also becomes clouded, resulting in a decline in the patient's visual acuity. Visual loss may become complete if the cornea completely opacitates. A wide variety of diseases, disorders, and\/or conditions can result in corneal neovascularization, including for example, corneal infections (e.g., trachoma, herpes simplex keratitis, leishmaniasis and onchocerciasis), immunological processes (e.g., graft rejection and Stevens-Johnson's syndrome), alkali burns, trauma, inflammation (of any cause), toxic and nutritional deficiency states, and as a complication of wearing contact lenses.","Within particularly preferred embodiments of the invention, may be prepared for topical administration in saline (combined with any of the preservatives and antimicrobial agents commonly used in ocular preparations), and administered in eyedrop form. The solution or suspension may be prepared in its pure form and administered several times daily. Alternatively, anti-angiogenic compositions, prepared as described above, may also be administered directly to the cornea. Within preferred embodiments, the anti-angiogenic composition is prepared with a muco-adhesive polymer which binds to cornea. Within further embodiments, the anti-angiogenic factors or anti-angiogenic compositions may be utilized as an adjunct to conventional steroid therapy. Topical therapy may also be useful prophylactically in corneal lesions which are known to have a high probability of inducing an angiogenic response (such as chemical burns). In these instances the treatment, likely in combination with steroids, may be instituted immediately to help prevent subsequent complications.","Within other embodiments, the compounds described above may be injected directly into the corneal stroma by an ophthalmologist under microscopic guidance. The preferred site of injection may vary with the morphology of the individual lesion, but the goal of the administration would be to place the composition at the advancing front of the vasculature (i.e., interspersed between the blood vessels and the normal cornea). In most cases this would involve perilimbic corneal injection to \u201cprotect\u201d the cornea from the advancing blood vessels. This method may also be utilized shortly after a corneal insult in order to prophylactically prevent corneal neovascularization. In this situation the material could be injected in the perilimbic cornea interspersed between the corneal lesion and its undesired potential limbic blood supply. Such methods may also be utilized in a similar fashion to prevent capillary invasion of transplanted corneas. In a sustained-release form injections might only be required 2-3 times per year. A steroid could also be added to the injection solution to reduce inflammation resulting from the injection itself.","Within another aspect of the present invention, methods are provided for treating or preventing neovascular glaucoma, comprising the step of administering to a patient a therapeutically effective amount of a polynucleotide, polypeptide, antagonist and\/or agonist to the eye, such that the formation of blood vessels is inhibited. In one embodiment, the compound may be administered topically to the eye in order to treat or prevent early forms of neovascular glaucoma. Within other embodiments, the compound may be implanted by injection into the region of the anterior chamber angle. Within other embodiments, the compound may also be placed in any location such that the compound is continuously released into the aqueous humor. Within another aspect of the present invention, methods are provided for treating or preventing proliferative diabetic retinopathy, comprising the step of administering to a patient a therapeutically effective amount of a polynucleotide, polypeptide, antagonist and\/or agonist to the eyes, such that the formation of blood vessels is inhibited.","Within particularly preferred embodiments of the invention, proliferative diabetic retinopathy may be treated by injection into the aqueous humor or the vitreous, in order to increase the local concentration of the polynucleotide, polypeptide, antagonist and\/or agonist in the retina. Preferably, this treatment should be initiated prior to the acquisition of severe disease requiring photocoagulation.","Within another aspect of the present invention, methods are provided for treating or preventing retrolental fibroplasia, comprising the step of administering to a patient a therapeutically effective amount of a polynucleotide, polypeptide, antagonist and\/or agonist to the eye, such that the formation of blood vessels is inhibited. The compound may be administered topically, via intravitreous injection and\/or via intraocular implants.","Additionally, diseases, disorders, and\/or conditions which can be treated, prevented, and\/or diagnosed with the polynucleotides, polypeptides, agonists and\/or agonists include, but are not limited to, hemangioma, arthritis, psoriasis, angiofibroma, atherosclerotic plaques, delayed wound healing, granulations, hemophilic joints, hypertrophic scars, nonunion fractures, Osler-Weber syndrome, pyogenic granuloma, scleroderma, trachoma, and vascular adhesions.","Moreover, diseases, disorders, and\/or conditions and\/or states, which can be treated, prevented, and\/or diagnosed with the polynucleotides, polypeptides, agonists and\/or agonists include, but are not limited to, solid tumors, blood born tumors such as leukemias, tumor metastasis, Kaposi's sarcoma, benign tumors, for example hemangiomas, acoustic neuromas, neurofibromas, trachomas, and pyogenic granulomas, rheumatoid arthritis, psoriasis, ocular angiogenic diseases, for example, diabetic retinopathy, retinopathy of prematurity, macular degeneration, corneal graft rejection, neovascular glaucoma, retrolental fibroplasia, rubeosis, retinoblastoma, and uvietis, delayed wound healing, endometriosis, vascluogenesis, granulations, hypertrophic scars (keloids), nonunion fractures, scleroderma, trachoma, vascular adhesions, myocardial angiogenesis, coronary collaterals, cerebral collaterals, arteriovenous malformations, ischemic limb angiogenesis, Osler-Webber Syndrome, plaque neovascularization, telangiectasia, hemophiliac joints, angiofibroma fibromuscular dysplasia, wound granulation, Crohn's disease, atherosclerosis, birth control agent by preventing vascularization required for embryo implantation controlling menstruation, diseases that have angiogenesis as a pathologic consequence such as cat scratch disease (), ulcers (), Bartonellosis and bacillary angiomatosis.","In one aspect of the birth control method, an amount of the compound sufficient to block embryo implantation is administered before or after intercourse and fertilization have occurred, thus providing an effective method of birth control, possibly a \u201cmorning after\u201d method. Polynucleotides, polypeptides, agonists and\/or agonists may also be used in controlling menstruation or administered as either a peritoneal lavage fluid or for peritoneal implantation in the treatment of endometriosis.","Polynucleotides, polypeptides, agonists and\/or agonists of the present invention may be incorporated into surgical sutures in order to prevent stitch granulomas.","Polynucleotides, polypeptides, agonists and\/or agonists may be utilized in a wide variety of surgical procedures. For example, within one aspect of the present invention a compositions (in the form of, for example, a spray or film) may be utilized to coat or spray an area prior to removal of a tumor, in order to isolate normal surrounding tissues from malignant tissue, and\/or to prevent the spread of disease to surrounding tissues. Within other aspects of the present invention, compositions (e.g., in the form of a spray) may be delivered via endoscopic procedures in order to coat tumors, or inhibit angiogenesis in a desired locale. Within yet other aspects of the present invention, surgical meshes which have been coated with anti- angiogenic compositions of the present invention may be utilized in any procedure wherein a surgical mesh might be utilized. For example, within one embodiment of the invention a surgical mesh laden with an anti-angiogenic composition may be utilized during abdominal cancer resection surgery (e.g., subsequent to colon resection) in order to provide support to the structure, and to release an amount of the anti-angiogenic factor.","Within further aspects of the present invention, methods are provided for treating tumor excision sites, comprising administering a polynucleotide, polypeptide, agonist and\/or agonist to the resection margins of a tumor subsequent to excision, such that the local recurrence of cancer and the formation of new blood vessels at the site is inhibited. Within one embodiment of the invention, the anti-angiogenic compound is administered directly to the tumor excision site (e.g., applied by swabbing, brushing or otherwise coating the resection margins of the tumor with the anti-angiogenic compound). Alternatively, the anti-angiogenic compounds may be incorporated into known surgical pastes prior to administration. Within particularly preferred embodiments of the invention, the anti-angiogenic compounds are applied after hepatic resections for malignancy, and after neurosurgical operations.","Within one aspect of the present invention, polynucleotides, polypeptides, agonists and\/or agonists may be administered to the resection margin of a wide variety of tumors, including for example, breast, colon, brain and hepatic tumors. For example, within one embodiment of the invention, anti-angiogenic compounds may be administered to the site of a neurological tumor subsequent to excision, such that the formation of new blood vessels at the site are inhibited.","The polynucleotides, polypeptides, agonists and\/or agonists of the present invention may also be administered along with other anti-angiogenic factors.

Moreover, the polypeptide or polynucleotide of the present invention can be used as an antigen in a vaccine to raise an immune response against infectious disease.","A polynucleotide or polypeptide and\/or agonist or antagonist of the present invention can be used to differentiate, proliferate, and attract cells, leading to the regeneration of tissues. (See, Science 276:59-87 (1997).) The regeneration of tissues could be used to repair, replace, or protect tissue damaged by congenital defects, trauma (wounds, burns, incisions, or ulcers), age, disease (e.g. osteoporosis, osteocarthritis, periodontal disease, liver failure), surgery, including cosmetic plastic surgery, fibrosis, reperfusion injury, or systemic cytokine damage.","Tissues that could be regenerated using the present invention include organs (e.g., pancreas, liver, intestine, kidney, skin, endothelium), muscle (smooth, skeletal or cardiac), vasculature (including vascular and lymphatics), nervous, hematopoietic, and skeletal (bone, cartilage, tendon, and ligament) tissue. Preferably, regeneration occurs without or decreased scarring.

A further example of tissue regeneration of non-healing wounds includes pressure ulcers, ulcers associated with vascular insufficiency, surgical, and traumatic wounds.","Similarly, nerve and brain tissue could also be regenerated by using a polynucleotide or polypeptide and\/or agonist or antagonist of the present invention to proliferate and differentiate nerve cells. Diseases that could be treated, prevented, and\/or diagnosed using this method include central and peripheral nervous system diseases, neuropathies, or mechanical and traumatic diseases, disorders, and\/or conditions (e.g., spinal cord disorders, head trauma, cerebrovascular disease, and stoke). Specifically, diseases associated with peripheral nerve injuries, peripheral neuropathy (e.g., resulting from chemotherapy or other medical therapies), localized neuropathies, and central nervous system diseases (e.g., Alzheimer's disease, Parkinson's disease, Huntington's disease, amyotrophic lateral sclerosis, and Shy-Drager syndrome), could all be treated, prevented, and\/or diagnosed using the polynucleotide or polypeptide and\/or agonist or antagonist of the present invention.","A polynucleotide or polypeptide and\/or agonist or antagonist of the present invention may have chemotaxis activity. A chemotaxic molecule attracts or mobilizes cells (e.g., monocytes, fibroblasts, neutrophils, T-cells, mast cells, eosinophils, epithelial and\/or endothelial cells) to a particular site in the body, such as inflammation, infection, or site of hyperproliferation. The mobilized cells can then fight off and\/or heal the particular trauma or abnormality.","A polynucleotide or polypeptide and\/or agonist or antagonist of the present invention may increase chemotaxic activity of particular cells. These chemotactic molecules can then be used to treat, prevent, and\/or diagnose inflammation, infection, hyperproliferative diseases, disorders, and\/or conditions, or any immune system disorder by increasing the number of cells targeted to a particular location in the body. For example, chemotaxic molecules can be used to treat, prevent, and\/or diagnose wounds and other trauma to tissues by attracting immune cells to the injured location. Chemotactic molecules of the present invention can also attract fibroblasts, which can be used to treat, prevent, and\/or diagnose wounds.","It is also contemplated that a polynucleotide or polypeptide and\/or agonist or antagonist of the present invention may inhibit chemotactic activity. These molecules could also be used to treat, prevent, and\/or diagnose diseases, disorders, and\/or conditions. Thus, a polynucleotide or polypeptide and\/or agonist or antagonist of the present invention could be used as an inhibitor of chemotaxis.","A polypeptide of the present invention may be used to screen for molecules that bind to the polypeptide or for molecules to which the polypeptide binds. The binding of the polypeptide and the molecule may activate (agonist), increase, inhibit (antagonist), or decrease activity of the polypeptide or the molecule bound. Examples of such molecules include antibodies, oligonucleotides, proteins (e.g., receptors), or small molecules.","Preferably, the molecule is closely related to the natural ligand of the polypeptide, e.g., a fragment of the ligand, or a natural substrate, a ligand, a structural or functional mimetic. (See, Coligan et al., Current Protocols in Immunology 1(2):Chapter 5 (1991).) Similarly, the molecule can be closely related to the natural receptor to which the polypeptide binds, or at least, a fragment of the receptor capable of being bound by the polypeptide (e.g., active site). In either case, the molecule can be rationally designed using known techniques.","Preferably, the screening for these molecules involves producing appropriate cells which express the polypeptide, either as a secreted protein or on the cell membrane. Preferred cells include cells from mammals, yeast, , or . Cells expressing the polypeptide (or cell membrane containing the expressed polypeptide) are then preferably contacted with a test compound potentially containing the molecule to observe binding, stimulation, or inhibition of activity of either the polypeptide or the molecule.","The assay may simply test binding of a candidate compound to the polypeptide, wherein binding is detected by a label, or in an assay involving competition with a labeled competitor. Further, the assay may test whether the candidate compound results in a signal generated by binding to the polypeptide.","Alternatively, the assay can be carried out using cell-free preparations, polypeptide\/molecule affixed to a solid support, chemical libraries, or natural product mixtures. The assay may also simply comprise the steps of mixing a candidate compound with a solution containing a polypeptide, measuring polypeptide\/molecule activity or binding, and comparing the polypeptide\/molecule activity or binding to a standard.","Preferably, an ELISA assay can measure polypeptide level or activity in a sample (e.g., biological sample) using a monoclonal or polyclonal antibody. The antibody can measure polypeptide level or activity by either binding, directly or indirectly, to the polypeptide or by competing with the polypeptide for a substrate.","Additionally, the receptor to which a polypeptide of the invention binds can be identified by numerous methods known to those of skill in the art, for example, ligand panning and FACS sorting (Coligan, et al., Current Protocols in Immun., 1(2), Chapter 5, (1991)). For example, expression cloning is employed wherein polyadenylated RNA is prepared from a cell responsive to the polypeptides, for example, NIH3T3 cells which are known to contain multiple receptors for the FGF family proteins, and SC-3 cells, and a cDNA library created from this RNA is divided into pools and used to transfect COS cells or other cells that are not responsive to the polypeptides. Transfected cells which are grown on glass slides are exposed to the polypeptide of the present invention, after they have been labeled. The polypeptides can be labeled by a variety of means including iodination or inclusion of a recognition site for a site-specific protein kinase.","Following fixation and incubation, the slides are subjected to auto-radiographic analysis. Positive pools are identified and sub-pools are prepared and re-transfected using an iterative sub-pooling and re-screening process, eventually yielding a single clones that encodes the putative receptor.","As an alternative approach for receptor identification, the labeled polypeptides can be photoaffinity linked with cell membrane or extract preparations that express the receptor molecule. Cross-linked material is resolved by PAGE analysis and exposed to X-ray film. The labeled complex containing the receptors of the polypeptides can be excised, resolved into peptide fragments, and subjected to protein microsequencing. The amino acid sequence obtained from microsequencing would be used to design a set of degenerate oligonucleotide probes to screen a cDNA library to identify the genes encoding the putative receptors.","Moreover, the techniques of gene-shuffling, motif-shuffling, exon-shuffling, and\/or codon-shuffling (collectively referred to as \u201cDNA shuffling\u201d) may be employed to modulate the activities of polypeptides of the invention thereby effectively generating agonists and antagonists of polypeptides of the invention.

In one embodiment, alteration of polynucleotides and corresponding polypeptides of the invention may be achieved by DNA shuffling. DNA shuffling involves the assembly of two or more DNA segments into a desired polynucleotide sequence of the invention molecule by homologous, or site-specific, recombination. In another embodiment, polynucleotides and corresponding polypeptides of the invention may be altered by being subjected to random mutagenesis by error-prone PCR, random nucleotide insertion or other methods prior to recombination.

Biologically active fragments are those exhibiting activity similar, but not necessarily identical, to an activity of the polypeptide. The biological activity of the fragments may include an improved desired activity, or a decreased undesirable activity.","Additionally, this invention provides a method of screening compounds to identify those which modulate the action of the polypeptide of the present invention. An example of such an assay comprises combining a mammalian fibroblast cell, a the polypeptide of the present invention, the compound to be screened and 3[H] thymidine under cell culture conditions where the fibroblast cell would normally proliferate. A control assay may be performed in the absence of the compound to be screened and compared to the amount of fibroblast proliferation in the presence of the compound to determine if the compound stimulates proliferation by determining the uptake of 3[H] thymidine in each case. The amount of fibroblast cell proliferation is measured by liquid scintillation chromatography which measures the incorporation of 3[H] thymidine. Both agonist and antagonist compounds may be identified by this procedure.","In another method, a mammalian cell or membrane preparation expressing a receptor for a polypeptide of the present invention is incubated with a labeled polypeptide of the present invention in the presence of the compound. The ability of the compound to enhance or block this interaction could then be measured. Alternatively, the response of a known second messenger system following interaction of a compound to be screened and the receptor is measured and the ability of the compound to bind to the receptor and elicit a second messenger response is measured to determine if the compound is a potential agonist or antagonist. Such second messenger systems include but are not limited to, cAMP guanylate cyclase, ion channels or phosphoinositide hydrolysis.","All of these above assays can be used as diagnostic or prognostic markers. The molecules discovered using these assays can be used to treat, prevent, and\/or diagnose disease or to bring about a particular result in a patient (e.g., blood vessel growth) by activating or inhibiting the polypeptide\/molecule. Moreover, the assays can discover agents which may inhibit or enhance the production of the polypeptides of the invention from suitably manipulated cells or tissues. Therefore, the invention includes a method of identifying compounds which bind to the polypeptides of the invention comprising the steps of: (a) incubating a candidate binding compound with the polypeptide; and (b) determining if binding has occurred. Moreover, the invention includes a method of identifying agonists\/antagonists comprising the steps of: (a) incubating a candidate compound with the polypeptide, (b) assaying a biological activity, and (c) determining if a biological activity of the polypeptide has been altered.","Also, one could identify molecules bind a polypeptide of the invention experimentally by using the beta-pleated sheet regions contained in the polypeptide sequence of the protein. Accordingly, specific embodiments of the invention are directed to polynucleotides encoding polypeptides which comprise, or alternatively consist of, the amino acid sequence of each beta pleated sheet regions in a disclosed polypeptide sequence.

Cytotoxic prodrugs that may be used according to the methods of the invention include, but are not limited to, glutamyl derivatives of benzoic acid mustard alkylating agent, phosphate derivatives of etoposide or mitomycin C, cytosine arabinoside, daunorubisin, and phenoxyacetamide derivatives of doxorubicin.","Further contemplated is the use of the polypeptides of the present invention, or the polynucleotides encoding these polypeptides, to screen for molecules which modify the activities of the polypeptides of the present invention. Such a method would include contacting the polypeptide of the present invention with a selected compound(s) suspected of having antagonist or agonist activity, and assaying the activity of these polypeptides following binding.","This invention is particularly useful for screening therapeutic compounds by using the polypeptides of the present invention, or binding fragments thereof, in any of a variety of drug screening techniques. The polypeptide or fragment employed in such a test may be affixed to a solid support, expressed on a cell surface, free in solution, or located intracellularly. One method of drug screening utilizes eukaryotic or prokaryotic host cells which are stably transformed with recombinant nucleic acids expressing the polypeptide or fragment. Drugs are screened against such transformed cells in competitive binding assays. One may measure, for example, the formulation of complexes between the agent being tested and a polypeptide of the present invention.","Thus, the present invention provides methods of screening for drugs or any other agents which affect activities mediated by the polypeptides of the present invention. These methods comprise contacting such an agent with a polypeptide of the present invention or a fragment thereof and assaying for the presence of a complex between the agent and the polypeptide or a fragment thereof, by methods well known in the art. In such a competitive binding assay, the agents to screen are typically labeled. Following incubation, free agent is separated from that present in bound form, and the amount of free or uncomplexed label is a measure of the ability of a particular agent to bind to the polypeptides of the present invention.","Another technique for drug screening provides high throughput screening for compounds having suitable binding affinity to the polypeptides of the present invention, and is described in great detail in European Patent Application 84\/03564, published on Sep. 13, 1984, which is incorporated herein by reference herein. Briefly stated, large numbers of different small peptide test compounds are synthesized on a solid substrate, such as plastic pins or some other surface. The peptide test compounds are reacted with polypeptides of the present invention and washed. Bound polypeptides are then detected by methods well known in the art. Purified polypeptides are coated directly onto plates for use in the aforementioned drug screening techniques. In addition, non-neutralizing antibodies may be used to capture the peptide and immobilize it on the solid support.","This invention also contemplates the use of competitive drug screening assays in which neutralizing antibodies capable of binding polypeptides of the present invention specifically compete with a test compound for binding to the polypeptides or fragments thereof. In this manner, the antibodies are used to detect the presence of any peptide which shares one or more antigenic epitopes with a polypeptide of the invention.","The human LTRPC3 polypeptides and\/or peptides of the present invention, or immunogenic fragments or oligopeptides thereof, can be used for screening therapeutic drugs or compounds in a variety of drug screening techniques. The fragment employed in such a screening assay may be free in solution, affixed to a solid support, borne on a cell surface, or located intracellularly. The reduction or abolition of activity of the formation of binding complexes between the ion channel protein and the agent being tested can be measured. Thus, the present invention provides a method for screening or assessing a plurality of compounds for their specific binding affinity with a LTRPC3 polypeptide, or a bindable peptide fragment, of this invention, comprising providing a plurality of compounds, combining the LTRPC3 polypeptide, or a bindable peptide fragment, with each of a plurality of compounds for a time sufficient to allow binding under suitable conditions and detecting binding of the LTRPC3 polypeptide or peptide to each of the plurality of test compounds, thereby identifying the compounds that specifically bind to the LTRPC3 polypeptide or peptide.","Methods of identifying compounds that modulate the activity of the novel human LTRPC3 polypeptides and\/or peptides are provided by the present invention and comprise combining a potential or candidate compound or drug modulator of immunoglobulin biological activity with an LTRPC3 polypeptide or peptide, for example, the LTRPC3 amino acid sequence as set forth in SEQ ID NOS:2, 41, or 43, and measuring an effect of the candidate compound or drug modulator on the biological activity of the LTRPC3 polypeptide or peptide. Such measurable effects include, for example, physical binding interaction; the ability to cleave a suitable immunoglobulin substrate; effects on native and cloned LTRPC3-expressing cell line; and effects of modulators or other immunoglobulin-mediated physiological measures.","Another method of identifying compounds that modulate the biological activity of the novel LTRPC3 polypeptides of the present invention comprises combining a potential or candidate compound or drug modulator of a immunoglobulin biological activity with a host cell that expresses the LTRPC3 polypeptide and measuring an effect of the candidate compound or drug modulator on the biological activity of the LTRPC3 polypeptide. The host cell can also be capable of being induced to express the LTRPC3 polypeptide, e.g., via inducible expression. Physiological effects of a given modulator candidate on the LTRPC3 polypeptide can also be measured. Thus, cellular assays for particular immunoglobulin modulators may be either direct measurement or quantification of the physical biological activity of the LTRPC3 polypeptide, or they may be measurement or quantification of a physiological effect. Such methods preferably employ a LTRPC3 polypeptide as described herein, or an overexpressed recombinant LTRPC3 polypeptide in suitable host cells containing an expression vector as described herein, wherein the LTRPC3 polypeptide is expressed, overexpressed, or undergoes upregulated expression.","Another aspect of the present invention embraces a method of screening for a compound that is capable of modulating the biological activity of a LTRPC3 polypeptide, comprising providing a host cell containing an expression vector harboring a nucleic acid sequence encoding a LTRPC3 polypeptide, or a functional peptide or portion thereof (e.g., SEQ ID NOS:2, 41, or 43); determining the biological activity of the expressed LTRPC3 polypeptide in the absence of a modulator compound; contacting the cell with the modulator compound and determining the biological activity of the expressed LTRPC3 polypeptide in the presence of the modulator compound. In such a method, a difference between the activity of the LTRPC3 polypeptide in the presence of the modulator compound and in the absence of the modulator compound indicates a modulating effect of the compound.","Essentially any chemical compound can be employed as a potential modulator or ligand in the assays according to the present invention. Compounds tested as immunoglobulin modulators can be any small chemical compound, or biological entity (e.g., protein, sugar, nucleic acid, lipid). Test compounds will typically be small chemical molecules and peptides. Generally, the compounds used as potential modulators can be dissolved in aqueous or organic (e.g., DMSO-based) solutions. The assays are designed to screen large chemical libraries by automating the assay steps and providing compounds from any convenient source. Assays are typically run in parallel, for example, in microtiter formats on microtiter plates in robotic assays. There are many suppliers of chemical compounds, including Sigma (St. Louis, Mo.), Aldrich (St. Louis, Mo.), Sigma-Aldrich (St. Louis, Mo.), Fluka Chemika-Biochemica Analytika (Buchs, Switzerland), for example. Also, compounds may be synthesized by methods known in the art.","High throughput screening methodologies are particularly envisioned for the detection of modulators of the novel LTRPC3 polynucleotides and polypeptides described herein. Such high throughput screening methods typically involve providing a combinatorial chemical or peptide library containing a large number of potential therapeutic compounds (e.g., ligand or modulator compounds). Such combinatorial chemical libraries or ligand libraries are then screened in one or more assays to identify those library members (e.g., particular chemical species or subclasses) that display a desired characteristic activity. The compounds so identified can serve as conventional lead compounds, or can themselves be used as potential or actual therapeutics.","A combinatorial chemical library is a collection of diverse chemical compounds generated either by chemical synthesis or biological synthesis, by combining a number of chemical building blocks (i.e., reagents such as amino acids). As an example, a linear combinatorial library, e.g., a polypeptide or peptide library, is formed by combining a set of chemical building blocks in every possible way for a given compound length (i.e., the number of amino acids in a polypeptide or peptide compound). Millions of chemical compounds can be synthesized through such combinatorial mixing of chemical building blocks.","The preparation and screening of combinatorial chemical libraries is well known to those having skill in the pertinent art. Combinatorial libraries include, without limitation, peptide libraries (e.g. U.S. Pat. No. 5,010,175; Furka, 199137:487-493; and Houghton et al., 1991354:84-88). Other chemistries for generating chemical diversity libraries can also be used. Nonlimiting examples of chemical diversity library chemistries include, peptides (PCT Publication No. WO 91\/019735), encoded peptides (PCT Publication No. WO 93\/20242), random bio-oligomers (PCT Publication No. WO 92\/00091), benzodiazepines (U.S. Pat. No. 5,288,514), diversomers such as hydantoins, benzodiazepines and dipeptides (Hobbs et al., 199390:6909-6913), vinylogous polypeptides (Hagihara et al., 1992114:6568), nonpeptidal peptidomimetics with glucose scaffolding (Hirschmann et al., 1992114:9217-9218), analogous organic synthesis of small compound libraries (Chen et al., 1994116:2661), oligocarbamates (Cho et al., 1993261:1303), and\/or peptidyl phosphonates (Campbell et al., 199459:658), nucleic acid libraries (see Ausubel, Berger and Sambrook, all supra), peptide nucleic acid libraries (U.S. Pat. No. 5,539,083), antibody libraries (e.g., Vaughn et al., 199614(3):309-314) and PCT\/US96\/10287), carbohydrate libraries (e.g., Liang et al., 1996274-1520-1522) and U.S. Pat. No. 5,593,853), small organic molecule libraries (e.g., benzodiazepines, Baum C&EN, Jan. 18, 1993, page 33; and U.S. Pat. No. 5,288,514; isoprenoids, U.S. Pat. No. 5,569,588; thiazolidinones and metathiazanones, U.S. Pat. No. 5,549,974; pyrrolidines, U.S. Pat. Nos. 5,525,735 and 5,519,134; morpholino compounds, U.S. Pat. No. 5,506,337; and the like).","Devices for the preparation of combinatorial libraries are commercially available (e.g., 357 MPS, 390 MPS, Advanced Chem Tech, Louisville Ky.; Symphony, Rainin, Woburn, Mass.; 433A Applied Biosystems, Foster City, Calif.; 9050 Plus, Millipore, Bedford, Mass.). In addition, a large number of combinatorial libraries are commercially available (e.g., ComGenex, Princeton, N.J.; Asinex, Moscow, Russia; Tripos, Inc., St. Louis, Mo.; ChemStar, Ltd., Moscow, Russia; 3D Pharmaceuticals, Exton, Pa.; Martek Biosciences, Columbia, Md., and the like).","In one embodiment, the invention provides solid phase based in vitro assays in a high throughput format, where the cell or tissue expressing an ion channel is attached to a solid phase substrate. In such high throughput assays, it is possible to screen up to several thousand different modulators or ligands in a single day. In particular, each well of a microtiter plate can be used to perform a separate assay against a selected potential modulator, or, if concentration or incubation time effects are to be observed, every 5-10 wells can test a single modulator. Thus, a single standard microtiter plate can assay about 96 modulators. If 1536 well plates are used, then a single plate can easily assay from about 100 to about 1500 different compounds. It is possible to assay several different plates per day; thus, for example, assay screens for up to about 6,000-20,000 different compounds are possible using the described integrated systems.","In another of its aspects, the present invention encompasses screening and small molecule (e.g., drug) detection assays which involve the detection or identification of small molecules that can bind to a given protein, i.e., a LTRPC3 polypeptide or peptide. Particularly preferred are assays suitable for high throughput screening methodologies.","In such binding-based detection, identification, or screening assays, a functional assay is not typically required. All that is needed is a target protein, preferably substantially purified, and a library or panel of compounds (e.g., ligands, drugs, small molecules) or biological entities to be screened or assayed for binding to the protein target. Preferably, most small molecules that bind to the target protein will modulate activity in some manner, due to preferential, higher affinity binding to functional areas or sites on the protein.","An example of such an assay is the fluorescence based thermal shift assay (3-Dimensional Pharmaceuticals, Inc., 3DP, Exton, Pa.) as described in U.S. Pat. Nos. 6,020,141 and 6,036,920 to Pantoliano et al.; see also, J. Zimmerman, 200020(8)). The assay allows the detection of small molecules (e.g., drugs, ligands) that bind to expressed, and preferably purified, ion channel polypeptide based on affinity of binding determinations by analyzing thermal unfolding curves of protein-drug or ligand complexes. The drugs or binding molecules determined by this technique can be further assayed, if desired, by methods, such as those described herein, to determine if the molecules affect or modulate function or activity of the target protein.","To purify a LTRPC3 polypeptide or peptide to measure a biological binding or ligand binding activity, the source may be a whole cell lysate that can be prepared by successive freeze-thaw cycles (e.g., one to three) in the presence of standard protease inhibitors. The LTRPC3 polypeptide may be partially or completely purified by standard protein purification methods, e.g., affinity chromatography using specific antibody described infra, or by ligands specific for an epitope tag engineered into the recombinant LTRPC3 polypeptide molecule, also as described herein. Binding activity can then be measured as described.","Compounds which are identified according to the methods provided herein, and which modulate or regulate the biological activity or physiology of the LTRPC3 polypeptides according to the present invention are a preferred embodiment of this invention. It is contemplated that such modulatory compounds may be employed in treatment and therapeutic methods for treating a condition that is mediated by the novel LTRPC3 polypeptides by administering to an individual in need of such treatment a therapeutically effective amount of the compound identified by the methods described herein.","In addition, the present invention provides methods for treating an individual in need of such treatment for a disease, disorder, or condition that is mediated by the LTRPC3 polypeptides of the invention, comprising administering to the individual a therapeutically effective amount of the LTRPC3-modulating compound identified by a method provided herein.","In specific embodiments, antagonists according to the present invention are nucleic acids corresponding to the sequences contained in SEQ ID NO:1, 3, 5, 7, 9 and\/or 11, or the complementary strand thereof, and\/or to nucleotide sequences contained a deposited clone. In one embodiment, antisense sequence is generated internally by the organism, in another embodiment, the antisense sequence is separately administered (see, for example, O'Connor, Neurochem., 56:560 (1991). Oligodeoxynucleotides as Antisense Inhibitors of Gene Expression, CRC Press, Boca Raton, Fla. (1988). Antisense technology can be used to control gene expression through antisense DNA or RNA, or through triple-helix formation. Antisense techniques are discussed for example, in Okano, Neurochem., 56:560 (1991); Oligodeoxynucleotides as Antisense Inhibitors of Gene Expression, CRC Press, Boca Raton, Fla. (1988). Triple helix formation is discussed in, for instance, Lee et al., Nucleic Acids Research, 6:3073 (1979); Cooney et al., Science, 241:456 (1988); and Dervan et al., Science, 251:1300 (1991). The methods are based on binding of a polynucleotide to a complementary DNA or RNA.","For example, the use of c-myc and c-myb antisense RNA constructs to inhibit the growth of the non-lymphocytic leukemia cell line HL-60 and other cell lines was previously described. (Wickstrom et al. (1988); Anfossi et al. (1989)). These experiments were performed in vitro by incubating cells with the oligoribonucleotide. A similar procedure for in vivo use is described in WO 91\/15580. Briefly, a pair of oligonucleotides for a given antisense RNA is produced as follows: A sequence complimentary to the first 15 bases of the open reading frame is flanked by an EcoR1 site on the 5 end and a HindIII site on the 3 end. Next, the pair of oligonucleotides is heated at 90\u00b0 C. for one minute and then annealed in 2\u00d7 ligation buffer (20 mM TRIS HCl pH 7.5, 10 mM MgCl2, 10 mM dithiothreitol (DTT) and 0.2 mM ATP) and then ligated to the EcoR1\/Hind III site of the retroviral vector PMV7 (WO 91\/15580).","For example, the 5\u2032 coding portion of a polynucleotide that encodes the mature polypeptide of the present invention may be used to design an antisense RNA oligonucleotide of from about 10 to 40 base pairs in length. A DNA oligonucleotide is designed to be complementary to a region of the gene involved in transcription thereby preventing transcription and the production of the receptor. The antisense RNA oligonucleotide hybridizes to the mRNA in vivo and blocks translation of the mRNA molecule into receptor polypeptide.","In one embodiment, the antisense nucleic acid of the invention is produced intracellularly by transcription from an exogenous sequence. For example, a vector or a portion thereof, is transcribed, producing an antisense nucleic acid (RNA) of the invention. Such a vector would contain a sequence encoding the antisense nucleic acid of the invention. Such a vector can remain episomal or become chromosomally integrated, as long as it can be transcribed to produce the desired antisense RNA. Such vectors can be constructed by recombinant DNA technology methods standard in the art. Vectors can be plasmid, viral, or others known in the art, used for replication and expression in vertebrate cells. Expression of the sequence encoding a polypeptide of the invention, or fragments thereof, can be by any promoter known in the art to act in vertebrate, preferably human cells. Such promoters can be inducible or constitutive. Such promoters include, but are not limited to, the SV40 early promoter region (Bernoist and Chambon, Nature, 29:304-310 (1981), the promoter contained in the 3\u2032 long terminal repeat of Rous sarcoma virus (Yamamoto et al., Cell, 22:787-797 (1980), the herpes thymidine promoter (Wagner et al., Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U.S.A., 78:1441-1445 (1981), the regulatory sequences of the metallothionein gene (Brinster et al., Nature, 296:39-42 (1982)), etc.","The antisense nucleic acids of the invention comprise a sequence complementary to at least a portion of an RNA transcript of a gene of interest. However, absolute complementarity, although preferred, is not required. A sequence \u201ccomplementary to at least a portion of an RNA,\u201d referred to herein, means a sequence having sufficient complementarity to be able to hybridize with the RNA, forming a stable duplex; in the case of double stranded antisense nucleic acids of the invention, a single strand of the duplex DNA may thus be tested, or triplex formation may be assayed. The ability to hybridize will depend on both the degree of complementarity and the length of the antisense nucleic acid Generally, the larger the hybridizing nucleic acid, the more base mismatches with a RNA sequence of the invention it may contain and still form a stable duplex (or triplex as the case may be). One skilled in the art can ascertain a tolerable degree of mismatch by use of standard procedures to determine the melting point of the hybridized complex.","Antisense oligonucleotides may be single or double stranded. Double stranded RNA's may be designed based upon the teachings of Paddison et al., Proc. Nat. Acad. Sci., 99:1443-1448 (2002); and International Publication Nos. WO 01\/29058, and WO 99\/32619; which are hereby incorporated herein by reference.","SiRNA reagents are specifically contemplated by the present invention. Such reagents are useful for inhibiting expression of the polynucleotides of the present invention and may have therapeutic efficacy. Several methods are known in the art for the therapeutic treatment of disorders by the administration of siRNA reagents. One such method is described by Tiscomia et al (PNAS, 100(4):1844-1848 (2003)); WO0409769, filed Jul. 18; and Reich SJ et al., Mol. Vis. 2003 May 30; 9:210-6, which are incorporated by reference herein in its entirety.","Oligonucleotides that are complementary to the 5\u2032 end of the message, e.g., the 5\u2032 untranslated sequence up to and including the AUG initiation codon, should work most efficiently at inhibiting translation. However, sequences complementary to the 3\u2032 untranslated sequences of mRNAs have been shown to be effective at inhibiting translation of mRNAs as well. See generally, Wagner, R., Nature, 372:333-335 (1994). Thus, oligonucleotides complementary to either the 5\u2032- or 3\u2032-non-translated, non-coding regions of a polynucleotide sequence of the invention could be used in an antisense approach to inhibit translation of endogenous mRNA. Oligonucleotides complementary to the 5\u2032 untranslated region of the mRNA should include the complement of the AUG start codon. Antisense oligonucleotides complementary to mRNA coding regions are less efficient inhibitors of translation but could be used in accordance with the invention. Whether designed to hybridize to the 5\u2032-, 3\u2032- or coding region of mRNA, antisense nucleic acids should be at least six nucleotides in length, and are preferably oligonucleotides ranging from 6 to about 50 nucleotides in length. In specific aspects the oligonucleotide is at least 10 nucleotides, at least 17 nucleotides, at least 25 nucleotides or at least 50 nucleotides.","The polynucleotides of the invention can be DNA or RNA or chimeric mixtures or derivatives or modified versions thereof, single-stranded or double-stranded. The oligonucleotide can be modified at the base moiety, sugar moiety, or phosphate backbone, for example, to improve stability of the molecule, hybridization, etc. The oligonucleotide may include other appended groups such as peptides (e.g., for targeting host cell receptors in vivo), or agents facilitating transport across the cell membrane (see, e.g., Letsinger et al., Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U.S.A. 86:6553-6556 (1989); Lemaitre et al., Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci., 84:648-652 (1987); PCT Publication NO: WO88\/09810, published Dec. 15, 1988) or the blood-brain barrier (see, e.g., PCT Publication NO: WO89\/10134, published Apr. 25, 1988), hybridization-triggered cleavage agents. (See, e.g., Krol et al., BioTechniques, 6:958-976 (1988)) or intercalating agents. (See, e.g., Zon, Pharm. Res., 5:539-549 (1988)). To this end, the oligonucleotide may be conjugated to another molecule, e.g., a peptide, hybridization triggered cross-linking agent, transport agent, hybridization-triggered cleavage agent, etc.","The antisense oligonucleotide may comprise at least one modified base moiety which is selected from the group including, but not limited to, 5-fluorouracil, 5-bromouracil, 5-chlorouracil, 5-iodouracil, hypoxanthine, xanthine, 4-acetylcytosine, 5-(carboxyhydroxylmethyl) uracil, 5-carboxymethylaminomethyl-2-thiouridine, 5-carboxymethylaminomethyluracil, dihydrouracil, beta-D-galactosylqueosine, inosine, N6-isopentenyladenine, 1-methylguanine, 1-methylinosine, 2,2-dimethylguanine, 2-methyladenine, 2-methylguanine, 3-methylcytosine, 5-methylcytosine, N6-adenine, 7-methylguanine, 5-methylaminomethyluracil, 5-methoxyaminomethyl-2-thiouracil, beta-D-mannosylqueosine, 5\u2032-methoxycarboxymethyluracil, 5-methoxyuracil, 2-methylthio-N6-isopentenyladenine, uracil-5-oxyacetic acid (v), wybutoxosine, pseudouracil, queosine, 2-thiocytosine, 5-methyl-2-thiouracil, 2-thiouracil, 4-thiouracil, 5-methyluracil, uracil-5-oxyacetic acid methylester, uracil-5-oxyacetic acid (v), 5-methyl-2-thiouracil, 3-(3-amino-3-N2-carboxypropyl)uracil, (acp3)w, and 2,6-diaminopurine.","The antisense oligonucleotide may also comprise at least one modified sugar moiety selected from the group including, but not limited to, arabinose, 2-fluoroarabinose, xylulose, and hexose.","In yet another embodiment, the antisense oligonucleotide comprises at least one modified phosphate backbone selected from the group including, but not limited to, a phosphorothioate, a phosphorodithioate, a phosphoramidothioate, a phosphoramidate, a phosphordiamidate, a methylphosphonate, an alkyl phosphotriester, and a formacetal or analog thereof.","In yet another embodiment, the antisense oligonucleotide is an a-anomeric oligonucleotide. An a-anomeric oligonucleotide forms specific double-stranded hybrids with complementary RNA in which, contrary to the usual b-units, the strands run parallel to each other (Gautier et al., Nucl. Acids Res., 15:6625-6641 (1987)). The oligonucleotide is a 2-0-methylribonucleotide (Inoue et al., Nucl. Acids Res., 15:6131-6148 (1987)), or a chimeric RNA-DNA analogue (Inoue et al., FEBS Lett. 215:327-330 (1987)).","Polynucleotides of the invention may be synthesized by standard methods known in the art, e.g. by use of an automated DNA synthesizer (such as are commercially available from Biosearch, Applied Biosystems, etc.). As examples, phosphorothioate oligonucleotides may be synthesized by the method of Stein et al. (Nucl. Acids Res., 16:3209 (1988)), methylphosphonate oligonucleotides can be prepared by use of controlled pore glass polymer supports (Sarin et al., Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U.S.A., 85:7448-7451 (1988)), etc.","While antisense nucleotides complementary to the coding region sequence of the invention could be used, those complementary to the transcribed untranslated region are most preferred.","Potential antagonists according to the invention also include catalytic RNA, or a ribozyme (See, e.g., PCT International Publication WO 90\/11364, published Oct. 4, 1990; Sarver et al, Science, 247:1222-1225 (1990). While ribozymes that cleave mRNA at site specific recognition sequences can be used to destroy mRNAs corresponding to the polynucleotides of the invention, the use of hammerhead ribozymes is preferred. Hammerhead ribozymes cleave mRNAs at locations dictated by flanking regions that form complementary base pairs with the target mRNA. The sole requirement is that the target mRNA have the following sequence of two bases: 5\u2032-UG-3\u2032. The construction and production of hammerhead ribozymes is well known in the art and is described more fully in Haseloff and Gerlach, Nature, 334:585-591 (1988). There are numerous potential hammerhead ribozyme cleavage sites within each nucleotide sequence disclosed in the sequence listing. Preferably, the ribozyme is engineered so that the cleavage recognition site is located near the 5\u2032 end of the mRNA corresponding to the polynucleotides of the invention; i.e., to increase efficiency and minimize the intracellular accumulation of non-functional mRNA transcripts.","As in the antisense approach, the ribozymes of the invention can be composed of modified oligonucleotides (e.g. for improved stability, targeting, etc.) and should be delivered to cells which express the polynucleotides of the invention in vivo. DNA constructs encoding the ribozyme may be introduced into the cell in the same manner as described above for the introduction of antisense encoding DNA. A preferred method of delivery involves using a DNA construct \u201cencoding\u201d the ribozyme under the control of a strong constitutive promoter, such as, for example, pol III or pol II promoter, so that transfected cells will produce sufficient quantities of the ribozyme to destroy endogenous messages and inhibit translation. Since ribozymes unlike antisense molecules, are catalytic, a lower intracellular concentration is required for efficiency.","Antagonist\/agonist compounds may be employed to inhibit the cell growth and proliferation effects of the polypeptides of the present invention on neoplastic cells and tissues, i.e. stimulation of angiogenesis of tumors, and, therefore, retard or prevent abnormal cellular growth and proliferation, for example, in tumor formation or growth.","The antagonist\/agonist may also be employed to prevent hyper-vascular diseases, and prevent the proliferation of epithelial lens cells after extracapsular cataract surgery. Prevention of the mitogenic activity of the polypeptides of the present invention may also be desirous in cases such as restenosis after balloon angioplasty.","The antagonist\/agonist may also be employed to prevent the growth of scar tissue during wound healing.","The antagonist\/agonist may also be employed to treat, prevent, and\/or diagnose the diseases described herein.","Thus, the invention provides a method of treating or preventing diseases, disorders, and\/or conditions, including but not limited to the diseases, disorders, and\/or conditions listed throughout this application, associated with overexpression of a polynucleotide of the present invention by administering to a patient (a) an antisense molecule directed to the polynucleotide of the present invention, and\/or (b) a ribozyme directed to the polynucleotide of the present invention.","A polynucleotide or polypeptide and\/or agonist or antagonist of the present invention may increase the organisms ability, either directly or indirectly, to initiate and\/or maintain biotic associations with other organisms. Such associations may be symbiotic, nonsymbiotic, endosymbiotic, macrosymbiotic, and\/or microsymbiotic in nature. In general, a polynucleotide or polypeptide and\/or agonist or antagonist of the present invention may increase the organisms ability to form biotic associations with any member of the fungal, bacterial, lichen, mycorrhizal, cyanobacterial, dinoflaggellate, and\/or algal, kingdom, phylums, families, classes, genuses, and\/or species.","The mechanism by which a polynucleotide or polypeptide and\/or agonist or antagonist of the present invention may increase the host organisms ability, either directly or indirectly, to initiate and\/or maintain biotic associations is variable, though may include, modulating osmolarity to desirable levels for the symbiont, modulating pH to desirable levels for the symbiont, modulating secretions of organic acids, modulating the secretion of specific proteins, phenolic compounds, nutrients, or the increased expression of a protein required for host-biotic organisms interactions (e.g., a receptor, ligand, etc.). Additional mechanisms are known in the art and are encompassed by the invention (see, for example, \u201cMicrobial Signalling and Communication\u201d, eds., R. England, G. Hobbs, N. Bainton, and D.

The mechanism by which a polynucleotide or polypeptide and\/or agonist or antagonist of the present invention may decrease the host organisms ability, either directly or indirectly, to initiate and\/or maintain biotic associations with another organism is variable, though may include, modulating osmolarity to undesirable levels, modulating pH to undesirable levels, modulating secretions of organic acids, modulating the secretion of specific proteins, phenolic compounds, nutrients, or the decreased expression of a protein required for host-biotic organisms interactions (e.g., a receptor, ligand, etc.). Additional mechanisms are known in the art and are encompassed by the invention (see, for example, \u201cMicrobial Signalling and Communication\u201d, eds., R. England, G. Hobbs, N. Bainton, and D. McL. Roberts, Cambridge University Press, Cambridge, (1999); which is hereby incorporated herein by reference).","The hosts ability to maintain biotic associations with a particular pathogen has significant implications for the overall health and fitness of the host. For example, human hosts have symbiosis with enteric bacteria in their gastrointestinal tracts, particularly in the small and large intestine. In fact, bacteria counts in feces of the distal colon often approach 10per milliliter of feces. Examples of bowel flora in the gastrointestinal tract are members of the Enterobacteriaceae, , in addition to a-hemolytic streptococci, , Bifobacteria, Anaerobic cocci, Eubacteria, Costridia, lactobacilli, and yeasts. Such bacteria, among other things, assist the host in the assimilation of nutrients by breaking down food stuffs not typically broken down by the hosts digestive system, particularly in the hosts bowel. Therefore, increasing the hosts ability to maintain such a biotic association would help assure proper nutrition for the host.","Aberrations in the enteric bacterial population of mammals, particularly humans, has been associated with the following disorders: diarrhea, ileus, chronic inflammatory disease, bowel obstruction, duodenal diverticula, biliary calculous disease, and malnutrition. A polynucleotide or polypeptide and\/or agonist or antagonist of the present invention are useful for treating, detecting, diagnosing, prognosing, and\/or ameliorating, either directly or indirectly, and of the above mentioned diseases and\/or disorders associated with aberrant enteric flora population.","The composition of the intestinal flora, for example, is based upon a variety of factors, which include, but are not limited to, the age, race, diet, malnutrition, gastric acidity, bile salt excretion, gut motility, and immune mechanisms. As a result, the polynucleotides and polypeptides, including agonists, antagonists, and fragments thereof, may modulate the ability of a host to form biotic associations by affecting, directly or indirectly, at least one or more of these factors.","Although the predominate intestinal flora comprises anaerobic organisms, an underlying percentage represents aerobes (e.g., ). This is significant as such aerobes rapidly become the predominate organisms in intraabdominal infections\u2014effectively becoming opportunistic early in infection pathogenesis. As a result, there is an intrinsic need to control aerobe populations, particularly for immune compromised individuals.","In a preferred embodiment, a polynucleotides and polypeptides, including agonists, antagonists, and fragments thereof, are useful for inhibiting biotic associations with specific enteric symbiont organisms in an effort to control the population of such organisms.","Biotic associations occur not only in the gastrointestinal tract, but also on an in the integument. As opposed to the gastrointestinal flora, the cutaneous flora is comprised almost equally with aerobic and anaerobic organisms. Examples of cutaneous flora are members of the gram-positive cocci (e.g., , coagulase-negative staphylococci, ), gram-positive bacilli (e.g., species, species, species, ), gram-negative bacilli (e.g., species), and fungi (). The relatively low number of flora associated with the integument is based upon the inability of many organisms to adhere to the skin. The organisms referenced above have acquired this unique ability. Therefore, the polynucleotides and polypeptides of the present invention may have uses which include modulating the population of the cutaneous flora, either directly or indirectly.","Aberrations in the cutaneous flora are associated with a number of significant diseases and\/or disorders, which include, but are not limited to the following: impetigo, ecthyma, blistering distal dactulitis, pustules, folliculitis, cutaneous abscesses, pitted keratolysis, trichomycosis axcillaris, dermatophytosis complex, axillary odor, erthyrasma, cheesy foot odor, acne, tinea versicolor, seborrheic dermititis, and , to name a few. A polynucleotide or polypeptide and\/or agonist or antagonist of the present invention are useful for treating, detecting, diagnosing, prognosing, and\/or ameliorating, either directly or indirectly, and of the above mentioned diseases and\/or disorders associated with aberrant cutaneous flora population.","Additional biotic associations, including diseases and disorders associated with the aberrant growth of such associations, are known in the art and are encompassed by the invention. See, for example, \u201cInfectious Disease\u201d, Second Edition, Eds., S. L., Gorbach, J. G., Bartlett, and N. R., Blacklow, W.B. Saunders Company, Philadelphia, (1998); which is hereby incorporated herein by reference).","In another embodiment, a polynucleotide or polypeptide and\/or agonist or antagonist of the present invention may increase the organisms ability to synthesize, release, and\/or respond to a pheromone, either directly or indirectly. Such a pheromone may, for example, alter the organisms behavior and\/or metabolism.","A polynucleotide or polypeptide and\/or agonist or antagonist of the present invention may modulate the biosynthesis and\/or release of pheromones, the organisms ability to respond to pheromones (e.g., behaviorally, and\/or metabolically), and\/or the organisms ability to detect pheromones, either directly or indirectly. Preferably, any of the pheromones, and\/or volatiles released from the organism, or induced, by a polynucleotide or polypeptide and\/or agonist or antagonist of the invention have behavioral effects on the organism.","For example, recent studies have shown that administration of picogram quantities of androstadienone, the most prominent androstene present on male human axillary hair and on the male axillary skin, to the female vomeronasal organ resulted in a significant reduction of nervousness, tension and other negative feelings in the female recipients (Grosser-BI, et al., Psychoneuroendocrinology, 25(3): 289-99 (2000)).","The polypeptide of the present invention, as a result of the ability to stimulate vascular endothelial cell growth, may be employed in treatment for stimulating re-vascularization of ischemic tissues due to various disease conditions such as thrombosis, arteriosclerosis, and other cardiovascular conditions. These polypeptide may also be employed to stimulate angiogenesis and limb regeneration, as discussed above.","The polypeptide may also be employed for treating wounds due to injuries, burns, post-operative tissue repair, and ulcers since they are mitogenic to various cells of different origins, such as fibroblast cells and skeletal muscle cells, and therefore, facilitate the repair or replacement of damaged or diseased tissue.","The polypeptide of the present invention may also be employed stimulate neuronal growth and to treat, prevent, and\/or diagnose neuronal damage which occurs in certain neuronal disorders or neuro-degenerative conditions such as Alzheimer's disease, Parkinson's disease, and AIDS-related complex. The polypeptide of the invention may have the ability to stimulate chondrocyte growth, therefore, they may be employed to enhance bone and periodontal regeneration and aid in tissue transplants or bone grafts.","The polypeptide of the invention may also be employed to maintain organs before transplantation or for supporting cell culture of primary tissues.","The polypeptide of the present invention may also be employed for inducing tissue of mesodermal origin to differentiate in early embryos.","The polypeptide or polynucleotides and\/or agonist or antagonists of the present invention may also increase or decrease the differentiation or proliferation of embryonic stem cells, besides, as discussed above, hematopoietic lineage.","The polypeptide or polynucleotides and\/or agonist or antagonists of the present invention may also be used to modulate mammalian characteristics, such as body height, weight, hair color, eye color, skin, percentage of adipose tissue, pigmentation, size, and shape (e.g., cosmetic surgery). Similarly, polypeptides or polynucleotides and\/or agonist or antagonists of the present invention may be used to modulate mammalian metabolism affecting catabolism, anabolism, processing, utilization, and storage of energy.","Polypeptide or polynucleotides and\/or agonist or antagonists of the present invention may be used to change a mammal's mental state or physical state by influencing biorhythms, caricadic rhythms, depression (including depressive diseases, disorders, and\/or conditions), tendency for violence, tolerance for pain, reproductive capabilities (preferably by Activin or Inhibin-like activity), hormonal or endocrine levels, appetite, libido, memory, stress, or other cognitive qualities.","Polypeptide or polynucleotides and\/or agonist or antagonists of the present invention may also be used as a food additive or preservative, such as to increase or decrease storage capabilities, fat content, lipid, protein, carbohydrate, vitamins, minerals, cofactors or other nutritional components.","Polypeptide or polynucleotides and\/or agonist or antagonists of the present invention may also be used to increase the efficacy of a pharmaceutical composition, either directly or indirectly.

Moreover, such a use may result in a number of beneficial changes in the recipient, such as, for example, any one of the following, non-limiting, effects: an increased level of hematopoietic cells, particularly red blood cells which would aid the recipient in coping with low oxygen levels; an increased level of B-cells, T-cells, antigen presenting cells, and\/or macrophages, which would aid the recipient in coping with exposure to extraterrestrial pathogens, for example; a temporary (i.e., reversible) inhibition of hematopoietic cell production which would aid the recipient in coping with exposure to extraterrestrial radiation levels; increase and\/or stability of bone mass which would aid the recipient in coping with low gravity environments; and\/or decreased metabolism which would effectively facilitate the recipients ability to prolong their extraterrestrial travel by any one of the following, non-limiting means: (i) aid the recipient by decreasing their basal daily energy requirements; (ii) effectively lower the level of oxidative and\/or metabolic stress in recipient (i.e., to enable recipient to cope with increased extraterrestial radiation levels by decreasing the level of internal oxidative\/metabolic damage acquired during normal basal energy requirements; and\/or (iii) enabling recipient to subsist at a lower metabolic temperature (i.e., cryogenic, and\/or sub-cryogenic environment).","Having generally described the invention, the same will be more readily understood by reference to the following examples, which are provided by way of illustration and are not intended as limiting.","Baldini G., Mccarthy E.

NSF domain was proposed to function in regulation of intracellular traffic via fusion of two lipid bilayers (Baldini et al.). Our previous publication (Lee et al.) on the LTRPC3 variant suggest the LTRPC3 variant is a membrane protein with storage-operated Ca channel activity. The NSF domain on the LTRPC3 variant protein may function to guide the localization of the LTRPC3 variant carrying intracellular membrane.

The FEN1 association data for LTRPC3 is provided here for representative purposes only although it is expected that the LTRPC3g-l variants have a similar FEN1 association as the LTRPC3 polypeptide since the LTRPC3g-l variants represent N-terminally extended versions of LTRPC3.","Antisense molecules or nucleic acid sequences complementary to the LTRPC3 protein-encoding sequence, or any part thereof, was used to decrease or to inhibit the expression of naturally occurring LTRPC3. Although the use of antisense or complementary oligonucleotides comprising about 15 to 35 base-pairs is described, essentially the same procedure is used with smaller or larger nucleic acid sequence fragments. An oligonucleotide based on the coding sequence of LTRPC3 protein as depicted in SEQ ID NO:14, for example, is used to inhibit expression of naturally occurring LTRPC3. The complementary oligonucleotide is typically designed from the most unique 5\u2032 sequence and is used either to inhibit transcription by preventing promoter binding to the coding sequence, or to inhibit translation by preventing the ribosome from binding to the LTRPC3 protein-encoding transcript. However, other regions may also be targeted.","Using an appropriate portion of a 5\u2032 sequence of SEQ ID NO:14, an effective antisense oligonucleotide includes any of about 15-35 nucleotides spanning the region which translates into the signal or 5\u2032 coding sequence, among other regions, of the polypeptide as shown in SEQ ID NO:15. Appropriate oligonucleotides are designed using OLIGO 4.06 software and the LTRPC3 protein coding sequence (SEQ ID NO:14).

In contrast, vector-transfected cells showed minimal Ca influx under the same experimental conditions (as shown in , left panels). The non-transfected cells were indistinguishable from the vector-transfected cells (data not shown). Therefore, LTRPC3 is a constitutively active channel capable of mediating Ca influx.","To further address the mechanism of LTRPC3-mediated Ca entry, similar Ca addition experiments were performed on transfected cells incubated (\u02dc30 min) in a nominally Ca-free solution. Previous studies have shown that lowering extracellular Ca concentration below physiological levels can deplete intracellular Ca stores in many cell types including HEK 293 (17, 4274-4282 (1998)). Incubating vector-transfected HEK 293 cells in a nominally Ca-free solution gave rise to Ca entry that was dependent on the concentration of Ca added to the buffers, indicating Ca influx was mediated through endogenous SOCs in HEK293 cells (as shown in ; left panel). In LTRPC3 cells, the Ca transients triggered by similar Ca treatment were much larger (as shown in , right panel). This Ca entry observed in LTRPC3 cells incubated in Ca-free media were greater than in 1 mM Ca media, indicating that LTRPC3-mediated Ca entry can be potentiated by the store-depletion.","The following protocol was used to demonstrate the expression profile of the LTRPC3 polypeptide (SEQ ID NO:15) using In situ hybridization and is described in U.S. Ser.

Forty-eight hours later, cells were stained in culture media with the membrane probe Vybrant\u2122 CM-DiI (5 \u03bcl\/ml; Molecular Probes) at 37\u00b0 C. for 5 min and 4\u00b0 C. for 15 min. Aft
