{"@attributes":{"id":"description"},"RELAPP":[{},{}],"heading":["CROSS REFERENCE TO RELATED APPLICATIONS","BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION","SUMMARY","DETAILED DESCRIPTION OF THE INVENTION"],"p":["The present application is a continuation application claiming priority under 35 U.S.C. \u00a7120 to utility application Ser. No. 11\/929,336 titled \u201cImproved Functionalities for Local Number Portability in a Telecommunications Network,\u201d filed on Oct. 30, 2007, which claims benefit of priority under 35 U.S.C. \u00a7119 (e) from U.S. Provisional Patent Application Ser. No. 60\/855,485, filed 31 Oct. 2006, entitled \u201cVOIP Enhanced Local Service Active Day of Port Trigger,\u201d and U.S. Provisional Patent Application Ser. No. 60\/941,102, filed 31 May 2007, entitled \u201cLocal Number Portability (LNP) Processes.\u201d All of the aforementioned patent applications are incorporated herein by reference for all purposes.","Local Number Portability (LNP) was defined in the Telecommunications Act of 1996 as the \u201cability of users of telecommunications services to retain, at the same location, existing telecommunications numbers without impairment of quality, reliability, or convenience when switching from one telecommunications carrier to another\u201d. In other words, LNP is the process by which customers request a change in underlying voice service from one telecommunications carrier to another.","LNP supports many porting options, including porting a wire line telephone number (TN) from one carrier to another carrier (referred to herein as a \u201ccore telecommunications carrier\u201d) (known as \u201cPort In\u201d), porting a wire line telephone number from the core telecommunications carrier to another carrier (known as \u201cPort Out\u201d), and porting wire line telephone numbers between customers of the core telecommunications carrier who are both using the network of the core telecommunications carrier (known as \u201cInternal Port\u201d or \u201cMigration\u201d).","The Federal Communications Commission (FCC) has required that all local exchange carriers (LEC) in the 100 largest metropolitan markets provide LNP no later than the end of 1998. The LNP rules that the FCC has put in place support competitive market theory by removing the personal inconvenience of having to obtain a new phone number when an end-user moves to a new preferred service provider. Carriers must honor a porting request that is supported by an end-user's authorization.","LNP received little attention until the FCC issued the mandate requiring the implementation of LNP according to a very aggressive schedule. The solution that was chosen by the FCC to provide LNP was the Local Routing Number (LRN) method. The LRN method includes providing, in addition to the original telephone number, a new 10-digit number (the LRN) along with the identification of the CLEC to which the service has been ported, when performing LNP. When the originating central office switch consults the Service Control Point (SCP) database to route an LNP number, the original telephone number and the LRN are utilized to identify the CLEC associated with the telephone number. The originating carrier then hands off the call to the CLEC. While this approach is claimed to be faster, clearly two telephone numbers are required, thereby placing additional pressure on the North American Numbering Plan (NANP).","With the emergence of LNP as a required service of telecommunications providers, customers of the telecommunications providers may present specific needs and services as part of the LNP process that may be addressed by processes that would be beneficial to the customer. For instance, special business models that involve LNP activities outside of the core telecommunications carrier may exist. The ability to provide a functionality that allows customers who want to port their own TNs to a telecommunications carrier using non-standard procedures, such as providing the capability to perform LNP themselves or by means of a third party may be beneficial.","In addition, customers may desire additional testing techniques to improve the LNP process. For example, the ability to test whether there are any errors in an LNP order request prior to actually submitting the order would be beneficial. Also, a test to determine whether a TN has already been ported in, ported out, or migrated from the telecommunications carrier would also be beneficial.","Another problem associated with the current LNP process, is that currently customers have no control over the timing during which ports occur on the Firm Order Commitment (FOC) date for their LNP order(s). Presently, ports for LNP are automatically triggered by the core telecommunications carrier within a pre-determined product-specific window. It would be beneficial to enable customers with the ability to trigger the activation sequence of the porting process for the TNs associated with their own orders.","Currently, none of the above improved functionalities to LNP exist. A telecommunications carrier would be able to provide better products and customer service if there were capable of providing such functionalities.","Embodiments of the present invention generally relate to improved functionalities for local number portability in a telecommunications network.","An embodiment of a method includes submitting, by a customer that owns a telephone number (TN), a local number portability (LNP) order for the TN directly to a first telecommunications carrier that the TN is to be transferred from; triggering, by the customer that owns the TN, a port of the TN in accordance with the LNP order; and porting, by a second telecommunications carrier that will service the TN after the LNP of the TN, the TN from the first telecommunications carrier to the second telecommunications carrier, wherein the second telecommunications carrier is bypassed by the customer during the submitting and the triggering of the LNP order.","An embodiment of the method may further include utilizing, by the customer, a business to business application programming interface (B2B API) to submit the LNP order directly to the first telecommunications carrier. The customer may manage activities including at least one of customer service records, local service requests, firm order commitments, and directory listing. The customer may manage any errors associated with the at least one of customer service records, local service requests, firm order commitments, and directory listing activities. The second telecommunications carrier may handle activities including at least one of customer name database (CNAM) and number portability administration center (NPAC). The second telecommunications carrier may handle any errors associated with the at least one of CNAM and NPAC activities.","In an embodiment of the method submitting the LNP order may further involve the customer determining service availability from the second telecommunications carrier; requesting a customer service record from the first telecommunications carrier; requesting a local service request from the first telecommunications carrier; and obtaining a firm order committing date for the LNP order from the first telecommunications carrier.","An embodiment of a system includes a customer that owns a telephone number (TN) enabled to submit a local number portability (LNP) order for the TN directly to a first telecommunications carrier that the TN is to be transferred from; trigger a port of the TN in accordance with the LNP order; and a core telecommunications carrier that will service the TN after the LNP of the TN, the core telecommunications carrier to port the TN from the first telecommunications carrier to the second telecommunications carrier, wherein the second telecommunications carrier is bypassed by the customer during the submitting and the triggering of the LNP order.","In an embodiment of the system the customer may utilize a business to business application programming interface (B2B API) to submit the LNP order directly to the first telecommunications carrier. The customer may manage activities including at least one of customer service records, local service requests, firm order commitments, and directory listing. The customer may manage any errors associated with the at least one of customer service records, local service requests, firm order commitments, and directory listing activities. The second telecommunications carrier may handle activities including at least one of customer name database (CNAM) and number portability administration center (NPAC).","In an embodiment of the system submitting the LNP order may further involve the customer determining service availability from the second telecommunications carrier; requesting a customer service record from the first telecommunications carrier; requesting a local service request from the first telecommunications carrier; and obtaining a firm order committing date for the LNP order from the first telecommunications carrier.","An embodiment of an article of manufacture includes a computer-accessible medium including data that, when accessed by a computer, causes the computer to perform operations including receiving information that a customer who owns a TN associated with a local number portability (LNP) order submitted the LNP order directly to a losing telecommunications carrier and triggered a port of the TN, the LNP order to transfer servicing of the TN from the losing telecommunications carrier; porting the TN associated with then LNP order from the losing telecommunications carrier, wherein the customer bypasses the telecommunications carrier that is to receive the TN for servicing from the losing telecommunications carrier during the submitting and the triggering of the LNP order.","In an embodiment of the article of manufacture the customer may utilize a business to business application programming interface (B2B API) to submit the LNP order directly to the losing telecommunications carrier. The customer may manage activities including at least one of customer service records, local service requests, firm order commitments, and directory listing. The customer may manage any errors associated with the at least one of customer service records, local service requests, firm order commitments, and directory listing activities.","In an embodiment of the article of manufacture the telecommunications carrier that is to receive the TN may handle activities including at least one of customer name database (CNAM) and number portability administration center (NPAC). The telecommunications carrier that is to receive the TN may handle any errors associated with the at least one of CNAM and NPAC activities.","In an embodiment of the article of manufacture submitting the LNP order further may include determining service availability from the telecommunications carrier that is to receive the TN; requesting a customer service record from the losing telecommunications carrier; requesting a local service request from the losing telecommunications carrier; and obtaining a firm order committing date for the LNP order from the losing telecommunications carrier.","One or more embodiments of the present invention are related to telecommunications and, more particularly, to systems and methods for improved functionalities for local number portability (LNP) in a telecommunications network.","Some embodiments of the present invention provide systems and methods for improved functionalities for local number portability in a telecommunications network.

If the address matches 3 out of 4 following conditions, then the validation succeeds.","(1) Does the State match?","(2) Does the Zip Match?","(3) Does the City Match?","(4) Does the Address Number and Street Name Match?","LSR Request []:","To port a TN to the core telecommunications carrier, a Local Service Request (LSR) should be submitted to the losing LEC to obtain approval for the LNP process. In some embodiments, this task is considered to be solely the customer's responsibility. The core telecommunications carrier, in some cases, might not assist with any LSR fall out the customer might experience due to the fact that the core telecommunications carrier does not own the carrier relationship in the business models associated with the LSR Bypass LNP Option.","Obtain FOC []:","Embodiments of the invention provide that the FOC date obtained from the LEC be used by the customer to submit a LNP order to the core telecommunications carrier, while using the FOC as the CRD on that request. In some case, this may be an important business rule for the LNP order submit process. In addition, this task is considered to be solely the customer's responsibility. The core telecommunications carrier, in some cases, may not assist with any LSR fall out the customer may experience due to the fact that the core telecommunications carrier does not own the carrier relationship in the business models associated with the LSR bypass LNP option.","Resolve CSR\/LSR Fallout []:","The customer is also responsible for resolving any fall out associate with CSR and\/or LSR fall out of the above processes. This resolution may include correcting any discrepancies in the CSR request or resolving any issues with the losing LEC that may be preventing the LNP process from occurring. The core telecommunications carrier, in some cases, might not assist with any LSR fall out the customer might experience due to the fact that the core telecommunications carrier does not own the carrier relationship in the business models associated with the LSR Bypass LNP Option.","Submit DL []:","This task is considered to be part of the Pre-Order submit process for the LSR bypass for LNP process. In one embodiment, the core telecommunications carrier does not provide DL services as part of a regular LSR bypass for LNP orders. Instead, the customer may choose to provide DL services himself, due to the customer's performance of the LSR activities with the LECs. In order to enable the customer to at least send the core telecommunications carrier this DL information, an LSR bypass for LNP orders may still require the DL information to be populated, yet with a DL request type of \u201cREMOVE\u201d, for example. This allows the customer to make any adds, moves, and changes after the initial LNP order is successfully completed.","This task is considered to be solely the customer's responsibility. The core telecommunications carrier, in some cases, may not assist with any LSR fall out that the customer may experience due the core telecommunications carrier not owning the carrier relationship in the business models associated with LSR bypass for LNP.","Real-Time (RT) Customer Service Record (CSR)","RT CSR is a LNP functionality that may be utilized as part of the Pre-Order submit process for the standard LNP Option. In one embodiment, as part of a standard LNP order, the core telecommunications carrier may request an advance CSR from the donor LEC for the TN being submitted for LNP. Then, the core telecommunication carrier may perform a multitude of validations on the data returned to help bypass future problems, as detailed below.","Typical CSR-related order fall out remains a high bar for a majority of LNP customers. Often times, a substantial amount of LNP orders for a given customer may be rejected by the core telecommunications carrier based on CSR data validations. Embodiments of RT CSR discussed here use an advance CSR request to preclude later rejections downstream in the actual LSR process associated with the donor LEC.","Embodiments of invention allow customers to utilize a simplified CSR request capability before an LNP order is submitted, known as a RT CSR. As part of RT CSR, CSR data will be returned in a near real-time fashion and corrections to upcoming LNP orders may be made before submitting the actual order to the core telecommunications carrier. Utilizing the novel RT CSR request capability may dramatically reduce the LNP order fall out encountered, resulting in standard porting Service Level Agreements (SLAs) being achieved on nearly all orders submitted, and thereby providing an improved customer experience.","Embodiments of the RT CSR request capability are available through various entry options. These options include manual entry, bulk entry, and B2B API. In addition, the RT CSR request capability may be utilized for TN's controlled by \u201cE-Bonded\u201d Carriers (LECs). \u201cE-Bonded\u201d means the core telecommunications carrier has automated interfaces established with the donor LEC in question. In some embodiments, the RT CSR request capability results may also be expected within a short time frame after the core telecommunications carrier has submitted the data to the donor LEC. However, occasional RT CSR requests might return a \u201cCSR Not Available\u201d error.","Prior to executing a RT CSR request, a \u201cService Availability\u201d request should be executed for each TN to obtain a positive result. In the case of the Bulk Load and B2B API based service availability capability, a customer should also obtain the \u201cE-Bonded=Y\/N\u201d results to identify if the OCN for that TN is considered \u201cE-Bonded\u201d. Customers are responsible to validate the returned CSR data for warnings and\/or errors that indicate that an action must be taken by the customer before submitting the data as part of an LNP order. Customers may also be responsible to validate the returned CSR data for port-inhibiting features on which action must be taken by the customer before submitting the data as part of an LNP order. In some cases, the customer may have to request that the subscriber contact the donor LEC to remove those features.","Further details of embodiments of the RT CSR request process are now described with respect to , which is a flow diagram depicting a process for RT CSR  according to one embodiment of the invention. At processing block , prior to executing the CSR Request, the customer should validate positive TN service availability. In some embodiments, the service availability capability by manual entry does not return any \u201cE-Bonded\u201d information for a Carrier OCN returned. At this point, the customer should continue with all TNs that are serviceable. For customers utilizing a bulk load or B2B API capability, the customer should validate the successful service availability results for the \u201cE-Bonded Y\/N\u201d information for the carrier OCN returned and continue only with those TNs listed as \u201cE-Bonded=Y\u201d. If the customer does continue with any TNs which are not considered E-Bonded, they may obtain an error on these TNs with the RT CSR results downstream.","Then, at processing block , utilizing the RT CSR request functionality, the customer should enter each TN and its associated name and address data (manually or via other formats for bulk load and B2B API) and submit the entry. A RT CSR request ID is returned and should be recorded by the customer at processing block . At processing block , if the customer has no intention to request RT CSR's for further TN's, they should wait for the duration of a predetermined time window, or else continue to submit other RT CSR requests at any time during this time window.","Next, at processing block , the customer may obtain CSR information by selecting an option to check results or by searching for the CSR Request by using the recorded CSR Request ID. In some cases, the customer may obtain a message that the information will be available later or not at all. At this point, the customer may view the results and check for potential fall out. For instance, non-Ebonded TNs will be tagged with an error code for the manual entry capability. Finally, if the RT CSR data is completely clean, the customer may proceed with an option to immediately continue to an order screen workflow without reentering the data.","In some embodiments of the invention, the customer may have to handle RT CSR request fall out . The following common corrective action steps may be used to resolve fall out:","1. Identify if RT CSR data is returned (SUCCESS) or if no RT CSR data is returned (ERROR).

The PCT allows a core telecommunications carrier to determine (1) at what point in time the core telecommunications carrier may provision a TN on its network (port in); (2) at what point in time the core telecommunications carrier may remove the TN from its network (port out); and\/or (3) at what point in time the core telecommunications carrier may migrate the TN from one customer on its network to another customer on its network (migrate). In some embodiments, the PCT may be deployed as software in the core telecommunications carrier's network.","In one embodiment, the PCT is given a TN and may be told the specific port activity (in or out), although this is not necessary. The PCT then checks through a LNP call tester (LCT) on the core telecommunications carrier's network, which references a subset of LERG data, to determine a current LRN for the TN being tested. Utilizing this current LRN, the PCT is able to determine whether a TN has been ported in, ported out, or migrated.  depict the process flow by which the PCT determines porting status for the core telecommunications carrier.","Process  is an exemplary method performed by a PCT of a core telecommunications carrier. Process  begins at process block  where a customer submits a TN for testing by the PCT. At processing block , the TN is submitted to a LNP call tester (LCT) to determine the current LRN. Then, at processing block , the LCT returns the current LRN for the TN that was tested. In some embodiments, this current LRN may be the same number as the TN.","Subsequently, at decision block , the PCT determines whether there is a target LRN for this TN. If so, the PCT determines whether the target LRN equals the current LRN . If this scenario is true, then the PCT is able to successfully determine that the TN has been ported  via migration. However, if the target LRN does not equal the current LRN at decision block , then the PCT sends the TN back for a retest  as the TN has not yet been ported.","Returning to decision block , is there is not a current LRN for the TN, then the process continues to decision block , where it is determines whether the TN is being ported in. If the TN is operating under a \u201cPort In\u201d status, then the process moves to decision block , where it is determined whether the TN equals the current LRN. If the TN does equal the current LRN, then at decision block  it is determined whether the TN is in a block of TNs owned by the core telecommunications carrier. If so, then the PCT is able to successfully determine that the TN has been ported  via a port in process. If the TN is not owned by the core telecommunications carrier, then the PCT sends the TN back for a retest  as the TN has not yet been ported.","Returning to decision block , if the TN does not equal the current LRN, then the process continues to decision block  where it is determined whether the current LRN is owned by the core telecommunications carrier.
