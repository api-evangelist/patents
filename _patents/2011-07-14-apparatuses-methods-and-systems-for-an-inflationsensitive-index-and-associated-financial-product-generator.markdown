title: Apparatuses, methods and systems for an inflation-sensitive index and associated financial product generator
abstract: The APPARATUSES, METHODS AND SYSTEMS FOR AN INFLATION-SENSITIVE INDEX AND ASSOCIATED FINANCIAL PRODUCT GENERATOR (“ISIG”) provides facilities for generating and managing inflation-sensitive financial indices and/or the associated portfolios of investment vehicles underlying them, as well as for constructing tradable financial products based on and/or otherwise influenced by the values of those indices. In one embodiment, the ISIG may generate, maintain and/or manage at least three indices and/or financial products based thereon (e.g., such as index-linked exchange traded funds, and/or the like): a long-term inflation index that depends on the long term inflation expectations embedded in the U.S. Government bond market; a long-term TIPS index, that tracks an investment in the longest TIPS in the marketplace, the 30 year TIPS bond, that may roll to on-the-run series according to a predefined roll schedule; and a long-term treasury index that tracks an investment in the longest maturity sector for government bonds with the price transparency and liquidity of a futures contract.

No. 61\/364,328 filed Jul. 14, 2010, entitled \u201cAPPARATUSES, METHODS AND SYSTEMS FOR AN INFLATION-SENSITIVE INDEX AND ASSOCIATED FINANCIAL PRODUCT GENERATOR,\u201d","The entire contents of the aforementioned application are herein expressly incorporated by reference.","This application for letters patent disclosure document describes inventive aspects directed at various novel innovations (hereinafter \u201cdisclosure\u201d) and contains material that is subject to copyright, mask work, and\/or other intellectual property protection. The respective owners of such intellectual property have no objection to the facsimile reproduction of the disclosure by anyone as it appears in published Patent Office file\/records, but otherwise reserve all rights.","The present invention is directed generally to apparatuses, methods, and systems of finance, and more particularly, to APPARATUSES, METHODS AND SYSTEMS FOR AN INFLATION-SENSITIVE INDEX AND ASSOCIATED FINANCIAL PRODUCT GENERATOR.","Inflation is the rate of change in the relative purchase power of money, or equivalently the price of goods and services, over time. Metrics such as the consumer price index and the retail price index have come about to track the cumulative prices of one or more select baskets of goods and\/or services over time in order to gain some measure of the amount of inflation in an economy. Inflation may be considered by investors in making various kinds of investments, inasmuch as it may affect the actual value of an investment or amount of returns received. For example, a quantity of money invested in a low-interest bank account may actually be losing value over time if the interest rate on the account is outpaced by the inflation rate. Some financial instruments, such as Treasury Inflation-Protected Securities (TIPS) have come about to provide investment opportunities that neutralize any adverse inflationary effects.","The APPARATUSES, METHODS AND SYSTEMS FOR AN INFLATION-SENSITIVE INDEX AND ASSOCIATED FINANCIAL PRODUCT GENERATOR (hereinafter \u201cISIG\u201d) provides facilities for generating and managing inflation-sensitive financial indices and\/or the associated portfolios of investment vehicles underlying them, as well as for constructing tradable financial products based on and\/or otherwise influenced by the values of those indices. In one embodiment, the ISIG may generate, maintain and\/or manage at least one of the following at least three indices and\/or financial products based thereon (e.g., such as index-linked exchange traded funds, and\/or the like): a long-term inflation index that depends on the long term inflation expectations embedded in the U.S. Government bond market; a long-term TIPS index, that tracks an investment in the longest TIPS in the marketplace, the 30 year TIPS bond, that may roll to on-the-run series according to a predefined roll schedule; and a long-term treasury index that tracks an investment in the longest maturity sector for government bonds with the price transparency and liquidity of a futures contract.","The leading number of each reference number within the drawings indicates the figure in which that reference number is introduced and\/or detailed.

It is to be understood that, depending on the particular needs and\/or characteristics of an ISIG user, financial product issuer, applicable market, market data source(s), index configuration, financial advisor, individual and\/or enterprise user, database configuration and\/or relational model, data type, data transmission and\/or network framework, syntax structure, and\/or the like, various embodiments of the ISIG may be implemented that enable a great deal of flexibility and customization. The instant disclosure discusses embodiments and\/or applications of the ISIG directed to generating, managing, administrating and\/or disseminating inflation-sensitive indices, their underlying portfolios and\/or associated financial products. However, it is to be understood that the apparatuses, methods and systems discussed herein may be readily adapted and\/or reconfigured for a wide variety of other applications and\/or implementations. For example, aspects of the ISIG may be adapted for both and\/or either long and\/or short positions on inflation, tracking modified inflationary indices, multiple and\/or foreign inflation rates, generating financial products with different positions with respect to inflationary futures, and\/or the like. Furthermore, aspects of the Platform may be configured to generate, administer, and\/or manage a wide variety of different financial instruments, securities, and\/or the like beyond specific embodiments and\/or implementations described in detail herein. For example, indices discussed herein may underly and\/or be linked to any of a wide variety of financial products, derivatives, instruments, and\/or the like, such as but not limited to: equities, debts, derivatives, notes (e.g., structured notes), stocks, preferred shares, bonds, treasuries, debentures, options, futures, swaps, rights, warrants, commodities, currencies, funds, long and\/or short positions, ETFs, insurance and\/or risk transfer agreements, annuities, and\/or other assets or investment interests. In one implementation, ISIG generated indices tracking inflation of various foreign currencies may be used to instruct weights in a basket of currencies designed to maximize returns based on market expectations of international inflationary distributions and relative currency values. It is to be understood that the ISIG may be further adapted to other implementations and\/or investment, finance and\/or risk management applications.",{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0023","num":"0022"},"figref":"FIG. 1","b":["101","105","101","110","115","117"],"ul":{"@attributes":{"id":"ul0001","list-style":"none"},"li":{"@attributes":{"id":"ul0001-0001","num":"0000"},"ul":{"@attributes":{"id":"ul0002","list-style":"none"},"li":["<XML>\n        \n        ","<\/XML>"]}}}},"ISIG systems may process received market data to generate index values and\/or to determine allocations of funds underlying indices to various investments, such as but not limited to OTR 30 year TIPS bonds and\/or shortest term quarterly Long-Term \u201cUltra\u201d U.S. Treasury Bond Futures contracts. In an implementation where the instruments underlying an ISIG index are to be actually obtained, orders for such investments at the determined levels may be placed and\/or instructed by ISIG systems with one or more TIPS market  and\/or Bond Futures market  exchanges and\/or outlets, such as may include one or both of primary and secondary markets. For example, a TIPS order may be placed  via Financial Information eXchange (FIX) API using FIX messages substantially in the following form:","8=FIX.5.0|9=140|35=D|49=Firm1|56=Firm2|34=101|11=Order1|55=TIPS1|54=1|","52=20110711-10:10:10|60=20110711-10:10:10|38=100|40=1|10=111","The above message indicates that it is in FIX 5.0 format, it is sent by Firm1 to buy 100 shares of TIPS bonds TIPS1 from Firm2.

The numbers in the above messages correspond to the following fields: BeginString(8), BodyLength(9), MsgType(35), SenderCompID(49), TargetCompID(56), MsgSeqNum(34), ClOrdID(11), Symbol(55), Side(54), SendingTime(52), TransactTime(60), OrderQty(38), OrdType(40), CheckSum(10). In another implementation, indices may be based on portfolios that are simulated, synthetic, and\/or the like. In such an implementation, orders may still be placed and\/or instructed by ISIG systems with one or more TIPS market  and\/or Bond Futures market  exchanges and\/or outlets in order to effectuate the generation and\/or transaction of financial products and\/or instruments based on ISIG generated indices.","Index values associated with the portfolio of investments, real or synthetic, that are generated and\/or administered by the ISIG server  may be stored in the ISIG DB  for future retrieval, display, report generation, updating, and\/or the like. For example, index values may be stored  via a SQL statement substantially in the following form:","INSERT INTO IndexValuesTable (IndexID, IndexValue, IndexValueTime","VALUES (\u2018index ID\u2019, \u2018index value\u2019, \u2018time when index value was in effect\u2019)","In one implementation, the ISIG may further provide index values via a communication network  for publication , such as on a website, market data resource, ticker, report, and\/or the like. For example, such index values may be provided  by retrieving them from the ISIG DB  via a SQL statement substantially in the following form:","SELECT IndexValue, IndexValueTime","FROM IndexValuesTable","WHERE IndexID=\u2018index ID\u2019","The ISIG may further be configured to generate and\/or instruct the generation of one or more financial instruments and\/or products with values linked to the value of one or more ISIG generated indices.

In one implementation, the closing value may be calculated on a daily basis, such as at the end of each U.S. trading day. In one implementation, daily index closing values may be calculated based on end-of-day trader marks on the TIPS bond and the official Chicago Mercantile Exchange settlement price on the futures contract at a specified time (e.g., 3:00 PM EST) and\/or at a time that conforms to bond market trading practice on a given day. The index calculator  may also be configured to track and\/or monitor values of components of one or more underlying real and\/or simulated ISIG portfolios and calculate index values based thereon. In one implementation, the index calculator may be configured to calculate values associated with a Long-Term Inflation (LTI) index, configured to reflect changes in the long term inflation expectations embedded in the U.S. Government bond market. In one implementation, the index calculator may be configured to calculate values associated with a Long-Term TIPS (LTTP) index, configured to track the value of an investment in the 30 year TIPS bond that rolls to OTR series according to a predefined rolling schedule. In one implementation, the index calculator may be configured to calculate values associated with a Long-Term Treasury (LTTS) index, configured to track the price returns of the Ultra-Long U.S. Bond Futures, coupled with a money market return of investing in the Federal Funds Market.","In one implementation, the ISIG controller  may further be coupled to a portfolio manager module  configured to manage one or more portfolios of financial instruments and\/or investments underlying one or more ISIG indices. Such portfolios may, in various implementations, comprise actual investments and\/or be simulated and\/or synthetic portfolios with values tied to specified investments. In one implementation, the portfolio manager module may be configured to administer a portfolio underlying the LTI index and comprising balanced investments in the 30-year TIPS bond and the Ultra-Long U.S. Bond Futures contract. In one implementation, the portfolio manager module may be configured to administer a portfolio underlying the LTTP index and comprising rolling investments in the 30-year TIPS bond, that rolls to OTR series bonds according to a pre-defined roll schedule. In one implementation, the portfolio manager module may be configured to administer a portfolio underlying the LTTS index and comprising investments in Ultra-Long U.S. Bond Futures, coupled with a money market return of investing in the Federal Funds Market.","In one implementation, the ISIG controller  may further be coupled to an index product marketer module  configured to generate, market, manage, and\/or the like financial products and\/or instruments with values tied to one or more ISIG indices. In various implementations, the index product marketer module may be configured to generate and manage any of a wide variety of different financial products, such as but not limited to: equities, debts, derivatives, notes (e.g., structured notes), stocks, preferred shares, bonds, treasuries, debentures, options, futures, swaps, rights, warrants, commodities, currencies, funds, long and\/or short positions, ETFs, insurance and\/or risk transfer agreements, annuities, and\/or other assets or investment interests. In one implementation, the index product marketer module may initiate the formation of a corporation, special purpose entity, fund, and\/or the like entity which owns a portfolio underlying an ISIG index and which issues shares with values tied to that index.","In one implementation, the ISIG controller  may further be coupled to one or more databases  configured to store a variety of data associated with ISIG operation in various embodiments. For example, in one implementation, the ISIG database may include tables for storing information associated with current and\/or historical LTI, LTTP, and\/or LTTS index values, underlying portfolios and\/or portfolio elements, ISIG index linked financial products, market data, transaction orders, transaction histories, and\/or the like.

During the (e.g., three month) roll periods (when the index is rolled into a new OTR bond) the bond portfolio of the index consists of two bonds\u2014On-The-Run and Off-The-Run. In one implementation, the index value may be computed using the two bond portfolio.

In turn, computers employ processors to process information; such processors  may be referred to as central processing units (CPU). One form of processor is referred to as a microprocessor. CPUs use communicative circuits to pass binary encoded signals acting as instructions to enable various operations. These instructions may be operational and\/or data instructions containing and\/or referencing other instructions and data in various processor accessible and operable areas of memory  (e.g., registers, cache memory, random access memory, etc.). Such communicative instructions may be stored and\/or transmitted in batches (e.g., batches of instructions) as programs and\/or data components to facilitate desired operations. These stored instruction codes, e.g., programs, may engage the CPU circuit components and other motherboard and\/or system components to perform desired operations. One type of program is a computer operating system, which, may be executed by CPU on a computer; the operating system enables and facilitates users to access and operate computer information technology and resources. Some resources that may be employed in information technology systems include: input and output mechanisms through which data may pass into and out of a computer; memory storage into which data may be saved; and processors by which information may be processed. These information technology systems may be used to collect data for later retrieval, analysis, and manipulation, which may be facilitated through a database program. These information technology systems provide interfaces that allow users to access and operate various system components.","In one embodiment, the ISIG controller  may be connected to and\/or communicate with entities such as, but not limited to: one or more users from user input devices ; peripheral devices ; an optional cryptographic processor device ; and\/or a communications network .","Networks are commonly thought to comprise the interconnection and interoperation of clients, servers, and intermediary nodes in a graph topology. It should be noted that the term \u201cserver\u201d as used throughout this application refers generally to a computer, other device, program, or combination thereof that processes and responds to the requests of remote users across a communications network. Servers serve their information to requesting \u201cclients.\u201d The term \u201cclient\u201d as used herein refers generally to a computer, program, other device, user and\/or combination thereof that is capable of processing and making requests and obtaining and processing any responses from servers across a communications network. A computer, other device, program, or combination thereof that facilitates, processes information and requests, and\/or furthers the passage of information from a source user to a destination user is commonly referred to as a \u201cnode.\u201d Networks are generally thought to facilitate the transfer of information from source points to destinations. A node specifically tasked with furthering the passage of information from a source to a destination is commonly called a \u201crouter.\u201d There are many forms of networks such as Local Area Networks (LANs), Pico networks, Wide Area Networks (WANs), Wireless Networks (WLANs), etc. For example, the Internet is generally accepted as being an interconnection of a multitude of networks whereby remote clients and servers may access and interoperate with one another.","The ISIG controller  may be based on computer systems that may comprise, but are not limited to, components such as: a computer systemization  connected to memory .","A computer systemization  may comprise a clock , central processing unit (\u201cCPU(s)\u201d and\/or \u201cprocessor(s)\u201d (these terms are used interchangeable throughout the disclosure unless noted to the contrary)) , a memory  (e.g., a read only memory (ROM) , a random access memory (RAM) , etc.), and\/or an interface bus , and most frequently, although not necessarily, are all interconnected and\/or communicating through a system bus  on one or more (mother)board(s)  having conductive and\/or otherwise transportive circuit pathways through which instructions (e.g., binary encoded signals) may travel to effect communications, operations, storage, etc. Optionally, the computer systemization may be connected to an internal power source . Optionally, a cryptographic processor  may be connected to the system bus. The system clock typically has a crystal oscillator and generates a base signal through the computer systemization's circuit pathways. The clock is typically coupled to the system bus and various clock multipliers that will increase or decrease the base operating frequency for other components interconnected in the computer systemization. The clock and various components in a computer systemization drive signals embodying information throughout the system. Such transmission and reception of instructions embodying information throughout a computer systemization may be commonly referred to as communications. These communicative instructions may further be transmitted, received, and the cause of return and\/or reply communications beyond the instant computer systemization to: communications networks, input devices, other computer systemizations, peripheral devices, and\/or the like. Of course, any of the above components may be connected directly to one another, connected to the CPU, and\/or organized in numerous variations employed as exemplified by various computer systems.","The CPU comprises at least one high-speed data processor adequate to execute program components for executing user and\/or system-generated requests. Often, the processors themselves will incorporate various specialized processing units, such as, but not limited to: integrated system (bus) controllers, memory management control units, floating point units, and even specialized processing sub-units like graphics processing units, digital signal processing units, and\/or the like. Additionally, processors may include internal fast access addressable memory, and be capable of mapping and addressing memory  beyond the processor itself; internal memory may include, but is not limited to: fast registers, various levels of cache memory (e.g., level , , , etc.), RAM, etc. The processor may access this memory through the use of a memory address space that is accessible via instruction address, which the processor can construct and decode allowing it to access a circuit path to a specific memory address space having a memory state. The CPU may be a microprocessor such as: AMD's Athlon, Duron and\/or Opteron; ARM's application, embedded and secure processors; IBM and\/or Motorola's DragonBall and PowerPC; IBM's and Sony's Cell processor; Intel's Celeron, Core (2) Duo, Itanium, Pentium, Xeon, and\/or XScale; and\/or the like processor(s). The CPU interacts with memory through instruction passing through conductive and\/or transportive conduits (e.g., (printed) electronic and\/or optic circuits) to execute stored instructions (i.e., program code) according to conventional data processing techniques. Such instruction passing facilitates communication within the ISIG controller and beyond through various interfaces. Should processing requirements dictate a greater amount speed and\/or capacity, distributed processors (e.g., Distributed ISIG), mainframe, multi-core, parallel, and\/or super-computer architectures may similarly be employed. Alternatively, should deployment requirements dictate greater portability, smaller Personal Digital Assistants (PDAs) may be employed.","Depending on the particular implementation, features of the ISIG may be achieved by implementing a microcontroller such as CAST's R8051XC2 microcontroller; Intel's MCS 51 (i.e., 8051 microcontroller); and\/or the like. Also, to implement certain features of the ISIG, some feature implementations may rely on embedded components, such as: Application-Specific Integrated Circuit (\u201cASIC\u201d), Digital Signal Processing (\u201cDSP\u201d), Field Programmable Gate Array (\u201cFPGA\u201d), and\/or the like embedded technology. For example, any of the ISIG component collection (distributed or otherwise) and\/or features may be implemented via the microprocessor and\/or via embedded components; e.g., via ASIC, coprocessor, DSP, FPGA, and\/or the like. Alternately, some implementations of the ISIG may be implemented with embedded components that are configured and used to achieve a variety of features or signal processing.","Depending on the particular implementation, the embedded components may include software solutions, hardware solutions, and\/or some combination of both hardware\/software solutions. For example, ISIG features discussed herein may be achieved through implementing FPGAs, which are a semiconductor devices containing programmable logic components called \u201clogic blocks\u201d, and programmable interconnects, such as the high performance FPGA Virtex series and\/or the low cost Spartan series manufactured by Xilinx. Logic blocks and interconnects can be programmed by the customer or designer, after the FPGA is manufactured, to implement any of the ISIG features. A hierarchy of programmable interconnects allow logic blocks to be interconnected as needed by the ISIG system designer\/administrator, somewhat like a one-chip programmable breadboard. An FPGA's logic blocks can be programmed to perform the function of basic logic gates such as AND, and XOR, or more complex combinational functions such as decoders or simple mathematical functions. In most FPGAs, the logic blocks also include memory elements, which may be simple flip-flops or more complete blocks of memory. In some circumstances, the ISIG may be developed on regular FPGAs and then migrated into a fixed version that more resembles ASIC implementations. Alternate or coordinating implementations may migrate ISIG controller features to a final ASIC instead of or in addition to FPGAs. Depending on the implementation all of the aforementioned embedded components and microprocessors may be considered the \u201cCPU\u201d and\/or \u201cprocessor\u201d for the ISIG.","The power source  may be of any standard form for powering small electronic circuit board devices such as the following power cells: alkaline, lithium hydride, lithium ion, lithium polymer, nickel cadmium, solar cells, and\/or the like. Other types of AC or DC power sources may be used as well. In the case of solar cells, in one embodiment, the case provides an aperture through which the solar cell may capture photonic energy. The power cell  is connected to at least one of the interconnected subsequent components of the ISIG thereby providing an electric current to all subsequent components. In one example, the power source  is connected to the system bus component . In an alternative embodiment, an outside power source  is provided through a connection across the I\/O  interface. For example, a USB and\/or IEEE 1394 connection carries both data and power across the connection and is therefore a suitable source of power.","Interface bus(ses)  may accept, connect, and\/or communicate to a number of interface adapters, conventionally although not necessarily in the form of adapter cards, such as but not limited to: input output interfaces (I\/O) , storage interfaces , network interfaces , and\/or the like. Optionally, cryptographic processor interfaces  similarly may be connected to the interface bus. The interface bus provides for the communications of interface adapters with one another as well as with other components of the computer systemization. Interface adapters are adapted for a compatible interface bus. Interface adapters conventionally connect to the interface bus via a slot architecture. Conventional slot architectures may be employed, such as, but not limited to: Accelerated Graphics Port (AGP), Card Bus, (Extended) Industry Standard Architecture ((E)ISA), Micro Channel Architecture (MCA), NuBus, Peripheral Component Interconnect (Extended) (PCI(X)), PCI Express, Personal Computer Memory Card International Association (PCMCIA), and\/or the like.","Storage interfaces  may accept, communicate, and\/or connect to a number of storage devices such as, but not limited to: storage devices , removable disc devices, and\/or the like.

Should processing requirements dictate a greater amount speed and\/or capacity, distributed network controllers (e.g., Distributed ISIG), architectures may similarly be employed to pool, load balance, and\/or otherwise increase the communicative bandwidth required by the ISIG controller. A communications network may be any one and\/or the combination of the following: a direct interconnection; the Internet; a Local Area Network (LAN); a Metropolitan Area Network (MAN); an Operating Missions as Nodes on the Internet (OMNI); a secured custom connection; a Wide Area Network (WAN); a wireless network (e.g., employing protocols such as, but not limited to a Wireless Application Protocol (WAP), I-mode, and\/or the like); and\/or the like. A network interface may be regarded as a specialized form of an input output interface. Further, multiple network interfaces  may be used to engage with various communications network types . For example, multiple network interfaces may be employed to allow for the communication over broadcast, multicast, and\/or unicast networks.","Input Output interfaces (I\/O)  may accept, communicate, and\/or connect to user input devices , peripheral devices , cryptographic processor devices , and\/or the like. I\/O may employ connection protocols such as, but not limited to: audio: analog, digital, monaural, RCA, stereo, and\/or the like; data: Apple Desktop Bus (ADB), IEEE 1394a-b, serial, universal serial bus (USB); infrared; joystick; keyboard; midi; optical; PC AT; PS\/2; parallel; radio; video interface: Apple Desktop Connector (ADC), BNC, coaxial, component, composite, digital, Digital Visual Interface (DVI), high-definition multimedia interface (HDMI), RCA, RF antennae, S-Video, VGA, and\/or the like; wireless: 802.11a\/b\/g\/n\/x, Bluetooth, code division multiple access (CDMA), global system for mobile communications (GSM), WiMax, etc.; and\/or the like. One typical output device may include a video display, which typically comprises a Cathode Ray Tube (CRT) or Liquid Crystal Display (LCD) based monitor with an interface (e.g., DVI circuitry and cable) that accepts signals from a video interface, may be used. The video interface composites information generated by a computer systemization and generates video signals based on the composited information in a video memory frame. Another output device is a television set, which accepts signals from a video interface. Typically, the video interface provides the composited video information through a video connection interface that accepts a video display interface (e.g., an RCA composite video connector accepting an RCA composite video cable; a DVI connector accepting a DVI display cable, etc.).","User input devices  may be card readers, dongles, finger print readers, gloves, graphics tablets, joysticks, keyboards, mouse (mice), remote controls, retina readers, trackballs, trackpads, and\/or the like.","Peripheral devices  may be connected and\/or communicate to I\/O and\/or other facilities of the like such as network interfaces, storage interfaces, and\/or the like.

However, memory is a fungible technology and resource, thus, any number of memory embodiments may be employed in lieu of or in concert with one another. It is to be understood that the ISIG controller and\/or a computer systemization may employ various forms of memory . For example, a computer systemization may be configured wherein the functionality of on-chip CPU memory (e.g., registers), RAM, ROM, and any other storage devices are provided by a paper punch tape or paper punch card mechanism; of course such an embodiment would result in an extremely slow rate of operation. In a typical configuration, memory  will include ROM , RAM , and a storage device . A storage device  may be any conventional computer system storage.

Thus, a computer systemization generally requires and makes use of memory.","The memory  may contain a collection of program and\/or database components and\/or data such as, but not limited to: operating system component(s)  (operating system); information server component(s)  (information server); user interface component(s)  (user interface); Web browser component(s)  (Web browser); database(s) ; mail server component(s) ; mail client component(s) ; cryptographic server component(s)  (cryptographic server); the ISIG component(s) ; and\/or the like (i.e., collectively a component collection). These components may be stored and accessed from the storage devices and\/or from storage devices accessible through an interface bus. Although non-conventional program components such as those in the component collection, typically, are stored in a local storage device , they may also be loaded and\/or stored in memory such as: peripheral devices, RAM, remote storage facilities through a communications network, ROM, various forms of memory, and\/or the like.","The operating system component  is an executable program component facilitating the operation of the ISIG controller. Typically, the operating system facilitates access of I\/O, network interfaces, peripheral devices, storage devices, and\/or the like.

An operating system may communicate to and\/or with other components in a component collection, including itself, and\/or the like. Most frequently, the operating system communicates with other program components, user interfaces, and\/or the like. For example, the operating system may contain, communicate, generate, obtain, and\/or provide program component, system, user, and\/or data communications, requests, and\/or responses. The operating system, once executed by the CPU, may enable the interaction with communications networks, data, I\/O, peripheral devices, program components, memory, user input devices, and\/or the like. The operating system may provide communications protocols that allow the ISIG controller to communicate with other entities through a communications network . Various communication protocols may be used by the ISIG controller as a subcarrier transport mechanism for interaction, such as, but not limited to: multicast, TCP\/IP, UDP, unicast, and\/or the like.","An information server component  is a stored program component that is executed by a CPU.

The information server may support secure communications protocols such as, but not limited to, File Transfer Protocol (FTP); HyperText Transfer Protocol (HTTP); Secure Hypertext Transfer Protocol (HTTPS), Secure Socket Layer (SSL), messaging protocols (e.g., America Online (AOL) Instant Messenger (AIM), Application Exchange (APEX), ICQ, Internet Relay Chat (IRC), Microsoft Network (MSN) Messenger Service, Presence and Instant Messaging Protocol (PRIM), Internet Engineering Task Force's (IETF's) Session Initiation Protocol (SIP), SIP for Instant Messaging and Presence Leveraging Extensions (SIMPLE), open XML-based Extensible Messaging and Presence Protocol (XMPP) (i.e., Jabber or Open Mobile Alliance's (OMA's) Instant Messaging and Presence Service (IMPS)), Yahoo! Instant Messenger Service, and\/or the like. The information server provides results in the form of Web pages to Web browsers, and allows for the manipulated generation of the Web pages through interaction with other program components. After a Domain Name System (DNS) resolution portion of an HTTP request is resolved to a particular information server, the information server resolves requests for information at specified locations on the ISIG controller based on the remainder of the HTTP request. For example, a request such as http:\/\/123.124.125.126\/myInformation.html might have the IP portion of the request \u201c123.124.125.126\u201d resolved by a DNS server to an information server at that IP address; that information server might in turn further parse the http request for the \u201c\/myInformation.html\u201d portion of the request and resolve it to a location in memory containing the information \u201cmyInformation.html.\u201d Additionally, other information serving protocols may be employed across various ports, e.g., FTP communications across port 21, and\/or the like. An information server may communicate to and\/or with other components in a component collection, including itself, and\/or facilities of the like. Most frequently, the information server communicates with the ISIG database , operating systems, other program components, user interfaces, Web browsers, and\/or the like.","Access to the ISIG database may be achieved through a number of database bridge mechanisms such as through scripting languages as enumerated below (e.g., CGI) and through inter-application communication channels as enumerated below (e.g., CORBA, WebObjects, etc.). Any data requests through a Web browser are parsed through the bridge mechanism into appropriate grammars as required by the ISIG. In one embodiment, the information server would provide a Web form accessible by a Web browser. Entries made into supplied fields in the Web form are tagged as having been entered into the particular fields, and parsed as such. The entered terms are then passed along with the field tags, which act to instruct the parser to generate queries directed to appropriate tables and\/or fields. In one embodiment, the parser may generate queries in standard SQL by instantiating a search string with the proper join\/select commands based on the tagged text entries, wherein the resulting command is provided over the bridge mechanism to the ISIG as a query. Upon generating query results from the query, the results are passed over the bridge mechanism, and may be parsed for formatting and generation of a new results Web page by the bridge mechanism. Such a new results Web page is then provided to the information server, which may supply it to the requesting Web browser.","Also, an information server may contain, communicate, generate, obtain, and\/or provide program component, system, user, and\/or data communications, requests, and\/or responses.","The function of computer interfaces in some respects is similar to automobile operation interfaces. Automobile operation interface elements such as steering wheels, gearshifts, and speedometers facilitate the access, operation, and display of automobile resources, functionality, and status. Computer interaction interface elements such as check boxes, cursors, menus, scrollers, and windows (collectively and commonly referred to as widgets) similarly facilitate the access, operation, and display of data and computer hardware and operating system resources, functionality, and status. Operation interfaces are commonly called user interfaces. Graphical user interfaces (GUIs) such as the Apple Macintosh Operating System's Aqua, IBM's OS\/2, Microsoft's Windows 2000\/2003\/3.1\/95\/98\/CE\/Millenium\/NT\/XP\/Vista\/7 (i.e., Aero), Unix's X-Windows (e.g., which may include additional Unix graphic interface libraries and layers such as K Desktop Environment (KDE), mythTV and GNU Network Object Model Environment (GNOME)), web interface libraries (e.g., ActiveX, AJAX, (D)HTML, FLASH, Java, JavaScript, etc. interface libraries such as, but not limited to, Dojo, jQuery(UI), MooTools, Prototype, script.aculo.us, SWFObject, Yahoo! User Interface, any of which may be used and) provide a baseline and means of accessing and displaying information graphically to users.","A user interface component  is a stored program component that is executed by a CPU. The user interface may be a conventional graphic user interface as provided by, with, and\/or atop operating systems and\/or operating environments such as already discussed. The user interface may allow for the display, execution, interaction, manipulation, and\/or operation of program components and\/or system facilities through textual and\/or graphical facilities. The user interface provides a facility through which users may affect, interact, and\/or operate a computer system. A user interface may communicate to and\/or with other components in a component collection, including itself, and\/or facilities of the like. Most frequently, the user interface communicates with operating systems, other program components, and\/or the like. The user interface may contain, communicate, generate, obtain, and\/or provide program component, system, user, and\/or data communications, requests, and\/or responses.","A Web browser component  is a stored program component that is executed by a CPU. The Web browser may be a conventional hypertext viewing application such as Microsoft Internet Explorer or Netscape Navigator. Secure Web browsing may be supplied with 128 bit (or greater) encryption by way of HTTPS, SSL, and\/or the like. Web browsers allowing for the execution of program components through facilities such as ActiveX, AJAX, (D)HTML, FLASH, Java, JavaScript, web browser plug-in APIs (e.g., FireFox, Safari Plug-in, and\/or the like APIs), and\/or the like. Web browsers and like information access tools may be integrated into PDAs, cellular telephones, and\/or other mobile devices. A Web browser may communicate to and\/or with other components in a component collection, including itself, and\/or facilities of the like. Most frequently, the Web browser communicates with information servers, operating systems, integrated program components (e.g., plug-ins), and\/or the like; e.g., it may contain, communicate, generate, obtain, and\/or provide program component, system, user, and\/or data communications, requests, and\/or responses. Of course, in place of a Web browser and information server, a combined application may be developed to perform similar functions of both. The combined application would similarly affect the obtaining and the provision of information to users, user agents, and\/or the like from the ISIG enabled nodes. The combined application may be nugatory on systems employing standard Web browsers.","A mail server component  is a stored program component that is executed by a CPU . The mail server may be a conventional Internet mail server such as, but not limited to sendmail, Microsoft Exchange, and\/or the like. The mail server may allow for the execution of program components through facilities such as ASP, ActiveX, (ANSI) (Objective-) C (++), C# and\/or .NET, CGI scripts, Java, JavaScript, PERL, PHP, pipes, Python, WebObjects, and\/or the like. The mail server may support communications protocols such as, but not limited to: Internet message access protocol (IMAP), Messaging Application Programming Interface (MAPI)\/Microsoft Exchange, post office protocol (POP3), simple mail transfer protocol (SMTP), and\/or the like. The mail server can route, forward, and process incoming and outgoing mail messages that have been sent, relayed and\/or otherwise traversing through and\/or to the ISIG.","Access to the ISIG mail may be achieved through a number of APIs offered by the individual Web server components and\/or the operating system.","Also, a mail server may contain, communicate, generate, obtain, and\/or provide program component, system, user, and\/or data communications, requests, information, and\/or responses.","A mail client component  is a stored program component that is executed by a CPU . The mail client may be a conventional mail viewing application such as Apple Mail, Microsoft Entourage, Microsoft Outlook, Microsoft Outlook Express, Mozilla, Thunderbird, and\/or the like. Mail clients may support a number of transfer protocols, such as: IMAP, Microsoft Exchange, POP3, SMTP, and\/or the like. A mail client may communicate to and\/or with other components in a component collection, including itself, and\/or facilities of the like. Most frequently, the mail client communicates with mail servers, operating systems, other mail clients, and\/or the like; e.g., it may contain, communicate, generate, obtain, and\/or provide program component, system, user, and\/or data communications, requests, information, and\/or responses. Generally, the mail client provides a facility to compose and transmit electronic mail messages.","A cryptographic server component  is a stored program component that is executed by a CPU , cryptographic processor , cryptographic processor interface , cryptographic processor device , and\/or the like. Cryptographic processor interfaces will allow for expedition of encryption and\/or decryption requests by the cryptographic component; however, the cryptographic component, alternatively, may run on a conventional CPU. The cryptographic component allows for the encryption and\/or decryption of provided data. The cryptographic component allows for both symmetric and asymmetric (e.g., Pretty Good Protection (PGP)) encryption and\/or decryption. The cryptographic component may employ cryptographic techniques such as, but not limited to: digital certificates (e.g., X.509 authentication framework), digital signatures, dual signatures, enveloping, password access protection, public key management, and\/or the like. The cryptographic component will facilitate numerous (encryption and\/or decryption) security protocols such as, but not limited to: checksum, Data Encryption Standard (DES), Elliptical Curve Encryption (ECC), International Data Encryption Algorithm (IDEA), Message Digest 5 (MD5, which is a one way hash function), passwords, Rivest Cipher (RC5), Rijndael, RSA (which is an Internet encryption and authentication system that uses an algorithm developed in 1977 by Ron Rivest, Adi Shamir, and Leonard Adleman), Secure Hash Algorithm (SHA), Secure Socket Layer (SSL), Secure Hypertext Transfer Protocol (HTTPS), and\/or the like. Employing such encryption security protocols, the ISIG may encrypt all incoming and\/or outgoing communications and may serve as node within a virtual private network (VPN) with a wider communications network. The cryptographic component facilitates the process of \u201csecurity authorization\u201d whereby access to a resource is inhibited by a security protocol wherein the cryptographic component effects authorized access to the secured resource. In addition, the cryptographic component may provide unique identifiers of content, e.g., employing and MD5 hash to obtain a unique signature for an digital audio file. A cryptographic component may communicate to and\/or with other components in a component collection, including itself, and\/or facilities of the like. The cryptographic component supports encryption schemes allowing for the secure transmission of information across a communications network to enable the ISIG component to engage in secure transactions if so desired. The cryptographic component facilitates the secure accessing of resources on the ISIG and facilitates the access of secured resources on remote systems; i.e., it may act as a client and\/or server of secured resources. Most frequently, the cryptographic component communicates with information servers, operating systems, other program components, and\/or the like. The cryptographic component may contain, communicate, generate, obtain, and\/or provide program component, system, user, and\/or data communications, requests, and\/or responses.","The ISIG database component  may be embodied in a database and its stored data. The database is a stored program component, which is executed by the CPU; the stored program component portion configuring the CPU to process the stored data. The database may be a conventional, fault tolerant, relational, scalable, secure database such as Oracle or Sybase. Relational databases are an extension of a flat file. Relational databases consist of a series of related tables. The tables are interconnected via a key field. Use of the key field allows the combination of the tables by indexing against the key field; i.e., the key fields act as dimensional pivot points for combining information from various tables. Relationships generally identify links maintained between tables by matching primary keys. Primary keys represent fields that uniquely identify the rows of a table in a relational database. More precisely, they uniquely identify rows of a table on the \u201cone\u201d side of a one-to-many relationship.","Alternatively, the ISIG database may be implemented using various standard data-structures, such as an array, hash, (linked) list, struct, structured text file (e.g., XML), table, and\/or the like. Such data-structures may be stored in memory and\/or in (structured) files. In another alternative, an object-oriented database may be used, such as Frontier, ObjectStore, Poet, Zope, and\/or the like. Object databases can include a number of object collections that are grouped and\/or linked together by common attributes; they may be related to other object collections by some common attributes. Object-oriented databases perform similarly to relational databases with the exception that objects are not just pieces of data but may have other types of functionality encapsulated within a given object. If the ISIG database is implemented as a data-structure, the use of the ISIG database  may be integrated into another component such as the ISIG component . Also, the database may be implemented as a mix of data structures, objects, and relational structures. Databases may be consolidated and\/or distributed in countless variations through standard data processing techniques. Portions of databases, e.g., tables, may be exported and\/or imported and thus decentralized and\/or integrated.","In one embodiment, the database component  includes several tables -. A market data table may include fields such as, but not limited to: market_data_feed_ID, asset_ID, asset_symbol, asset_name, spot_price, bid_price, ask_price, and\/or the like; in one embodiment, the market data table is populated through a market data feed (e.g., Bloomberg's PhatPipe, Dun & Bradstreet, Reuter's Tib, Triarch, etc.), for example, through Microsoft's Active Template Library and Dealing Object Technology's real-time toolkit Rtt.Multi. An indices table may include fields such as, but not limited to: index_ID, index_name, components, values, history, portfolio_ID, portfolio_components, portfolio_weights, portfolio_values, product_ID(s), restrictions and\/or authorizations, index_profile, and\/or the like. A products table may include fields such as, but not limited to: product_ID, product_name, index_ID(s), terms, restrictions, transaction_history, values, chain_of_title, and\/or the like.","In one embodiment, the ISIG database may interact with other database systems. For example, employing a distributed database system, queries and data access by search ISIG component may treat the combination of the ISIG database, an integrated data security layer database as a single database entity.","In one embodiment, user programs may contain various user interface primitives, which may serve to update the ISIG. Also, various accounts may require custom database tables depending upon the environments and the types of clients the ISIG may need to serve. It should be noted that any unique fields may be designated as a key field throughout. In an alternative embodiment, these tables have been decentralized into their own databases and their respective database controllers (i.e., individual database controllers for each of the above tables). Employing standard data processing techniques, one may further distribute the databases over several computer systemizations and\/or storage devices. Similarly, configurations of the decentralized database controllers may be varied by consolidating and\/or distributing the various database components -. The ISIG may be configured to keep track of various settings, inputs, and parameters via database controllers.","The ISIG database may communicate to and\/or with other components in a component collection, including itself, and\/or facilities of the like. Most frequently, the ISIG database communicates with the ISIG component, other program components, and\/or the like. The database may contain, retain, and provide information regarding other nodes and data.","The ISIG component  is a stored program component that is executed by a CPU. In one embodiment, the ISIG component incorporates any and\/or all combinations of the aspects of the ISIG that was discussed in the previous figures. As such, the ISIG affects accessing, obtaining and the provision of information, services, transactions, and\/or the like across various communications networks.","The ISIG component enables the determination of weights for constituents of index-linked financial portfolios, the acquisition and\/or maintenance\/management of those constituents (e.g., on-the-run 30 year TIPS bond, shortest term quarterly Long-Term \u201cUltra\u201d U.S. Treasury Bond Futures, and\/or the like), the determination of market values and\/or returns associated with the indices, the generation of financial products based on the indices, and\/or the like and use of the ISIG.","The ISIG component enabling access of information between nodes may be developed by employing standard development tools and languages such as, but not limited to: Apache components, Assembly, ActiveX, binary executables, (ANSI) o (Objective-) C (++), C# and\/or .NET, database adapters, CGI scripts, Java, JavaScript, mapping tools, procedural and object oriented development tools, PERL, PHP, Python, shell scripts, SQL commands, web application server extensions, web development environments and libraries (e.g., Microsoft's ActiveX; Adobe AIR, FLEX & FLASH; AJAX; (D)HTML; Dojo, Java; JavaScript; jQuery(UI); MooTools; Prototype; script.aculo.us; Simple Object Access Protocol (SOAP); SWFObject; Yahoo! User Interface; and\/or the like), WebObjects, and\/or the like. In one embodiment, the ISIG server employs a cryptographic server to encrypt and decrypt communications. The ISIG component may communicate to and\/or with other components in a component collection, including itself, and\/or facilities of the like. Most frequently, the ISIG component communicates with the ISIG database, operating systems, other program components, and\/or the like. The ISIG may contain, communicate, generate, obtain, and\/or provide program component, system, user, and\/or data communications, requests, and\/or responses.","The structure and\/or operation of any of the ISIG node controller components may be combined, consolidated, and\/or distributed in any number of ways to facilitate development and\/or deployment. Similarly, the component collection may be combined in any number of ways to facilitate deployment and\/or development. To accomplish this, one may integrate the components into a common code base or in a facility that can dynamically load the components on demand in an integrated fashion.","The component collection may be consolidated and\/or distributed in countless variations through standard data processing and\/or development techniques. Multiple instances of any one of the program components in the program component collection may be instantiated on a single node, and\/or across numerous nodes to improve performance through load-balancing and\/or data-processing techniques. Furthermore, single instances may also be distributed across multiple controllers and\/or storage devices; e.g., databases. All program component instances and controllers working in concert may do so through standard data processing communication techniques.","The configuration of the ISIG controller will depend on the context of system deployment. Factors such as, but not limited to, the budget, capacity, location, and\/or use of the underlying hardware resources may affect deployment requirements and configuration. Regardless of if the configuration results in more consolidated and\/or integrated program components, results in a more distributed series of program components, and\/or results in some combination between a consolidated and distributed configuration, data may be communicated, obtained, and\/or provided. Instances of components consolidated into a common code base from the program component collection may communicate, obtain, and\/or provide data. This may be accomplished through intra-application data processing communication techniques such as, but not limited to: data referencing (e.g., pointers), internal messaging, object instance variable communication, shared memory space, variable passing, and\/or the like.","If component collection components are discrete, separate, and\/or external to one another, then communicating, obtaining, and\/or providing data with and\/or to other component components may be accomplished through inter-application data processing communication techniques such as, but not limited to: Application Program Interfaces (API) information passage; (distributed) Component Object Model ((D)COM), (Distributed) Object Linking and Embedding ((D)OLE), and\/or the like), Common Object Request Broker Architecture (CORBA), local and remote application program interfaces Jini, Remote Method Invocation (RMI), SOAP, process pipes, shared files, and\/or the like. Messages sent between discrete component components for inter-application communication or within memory spaces of a singular component for intra-application communication may be facilitated through the creation and parsing of a grammar. A grammar may be developed by using standard development tools such as lex, yacc, XML, and\/or the like, which allow for grammar generation and parsing functionality, which in turn may form the basis of communication messages within and between components. For example, a grammar may be arranged to recognize the tokens of an HTTP post command, e.g.:\n\n","where Value1 is discerned as being a parameter because \u201chttp:\/\/\u201d is part of the grammar syntax, and what follows is considered part of the post value. Similarly, with such a grammar, a variable \u201cValue1\u201d may be inserted into an \u201chttp:\/\/\u201d post command and then sent. The grammar syntax itself may be presented as structured data that is interpreted and\/or otherwise used to generate the parsing mechanism (e.g., a syntax description text file as processed by lex, yacc, etc.). Also, once the parsing mechanism is generated and\/or instantiated, it itself may process and\/or parse structured data such as, but not limited to: character (e.g., tab) delineated text, HTML, structured text streams, XML, and\/or the like structured data. In another embodiment, inter-application data processing protocols themselves may have integrated and\/or readily available parsers (e.g., the SOAP parser) that may be employed to parse (e.g., communications) data. Further, the parsing grammar may be used beyond message parsing, but may also be used to parse: databases, data collections, data stores, structured data, and\/or the like. Again, the desired configuration will depend upon the context, environment, and requirements of system deployment. The following resources may be used to provide example embodiments regarding SOAP parser implementation:","http:\/\/www.xav.com\/perl\/site\/lib\/SOAP\/Parser.html","http:\/\/publib.boulder.ibm.com\/infocenter\/tivihelp\/v2r1\/index.jsp?topic=\/com.ibm.IBMDI.doc\/referenceguide295.htm","and other parser implementations:","http:\/\/publib.boulder.ibm.com\/infocenter\/tivihelp\/v2r1\/index.jsp?topic=\/com.ibm.IBMDI.doc\/referenceguide259.htm","all of which are hereby expressly incorporated by reference.","In order to address various issues and improve over previous works, the application is directed to APPARATUSES, METHODS AND SYSTEMS FOR AN INFLATION-SENSITIVE INDEX AND ASSOCIATED FINANCIAL PRODUCT GENERATOR.
