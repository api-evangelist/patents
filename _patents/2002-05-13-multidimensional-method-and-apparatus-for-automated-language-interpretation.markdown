{"@attributes":{"id":"description"},"BRFSUM":[{},{}],"heading":["BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION","SUMMARY OF THE INVENTION","DESCRIPTION OF THE PREFERRED EMBODIMENTS"],"p":["1. Field of the Invention","The present invention relates generally to natural language understanding and more specifically to knowledge-based methods for determining which of all possible meanings is intended by the speaker or writer of any portion of text in English or another natural language. As both words and phrases can often have multiple meanings, the problem is significant and many prior approaches have failed to yield satisfactory results. In order to achieve a high level of accuracy in natural language meaning interpretation, a knowledge base of information similar in breadth and depth to the knowledge of a human being is needed. Using digital or other automated strategies to represent and process this quantity of knowledge must be highly optimized to achieve satisfactory performance.","2. Description of Related Art","Under the general field of automated data processing, natural language processing falls under the specific category of artificial intelligence or, more recently, knowledge-based systems. Over the course of time, many of the trends and new developments in artificial intelligence have lead to new approaches for natural language processing. One such trend is \u201crules-based\u201d systems applying production rules to perform forward-chaining or backward-chaining inference. The typical failing of these systems has been that the number of rules required to express the complexity of language has been extremely high and the sequential processing of these rules has lead to unacceptably long processing times.","An earlier trend involved list-based approaches using the LISP programming language. LISP provides an elegant computational mechanism of lists for processing many rules as constraints for interpreting text. Unfortunately, as the lists proliferate, list management becomes impractical and correlation of related constraints in different lists or even at opposite ends of the same list consumed too much computational effort and took too long. Those efforts were followed by logic-based approaches using the PROLOG programming language. This was a special syntax or structure for production rule type systems as described above and performance problems made these approaches equally impractical.","Some developers have used neural network approaches with connectionist and other neural networks to attempt to understand language. The model is appealing because the formulas, algorithms, and structures seem to mimic the brain. Neural networks have proven very good for two-dimensional and some three-dimensional problems such as automated character recognition and voice recognition. Neural networks appear to be good representations of the parts of the brain responsible for these tasks with limited dimensionality. Unfortunately, they require an inordinate amount of training time to \u201clearn\u201d about each new object. Furthermore, language understanding involves multiple dimensions, and the parts of the brain responsible for these functions appear to have more complex structures and processes. Therefore, a new approach is needed.","Most language analysis approaches, including those described above, have used different parsing techniques where the sentence is scanned from left to right, or right to left, and the syntactic structure determined based on patterns or rules. Newer approaches have added semantic constraint resolution to the syntactic analysis to improve the accuracy and usefulness of the results. These have introduced incremental advances in capabilities, but without the full analysis of context, they have not significantly increased the accuracy of language interpretation. Syntax is an important dimension of language understanding, and adding the dimension of semantics is important. But without the dimension of context, the accuracy will never approach human competency in language comprehension.","There have been various approaches that use genetic or evolutionary algorithms, semantic networks, conceptual schema and, most recently, Bayesian networks that seek to add the dimension of context. Though these approaches hold the promise of much higher accuracy, the proliferation of nodes in the semantic and Bayesian networks have made it impossible to achieve sufficient speeds to process language without unacceptable delays. Specifically, as these networks increase in size beyond dozens or hundreds of nodes, the processing times required to perform language analysis increases exponentially. When they attempt to include syntactic, semantic, and contextual information in these networks, the combinatorial explosion of processing time renders these systems useless.","3. Definitions of Terms","Activation","The spread of positive and negative electrical potential in the brain from neuron to neuron is called activation. Positive activation is called excitation and negative activation is called inhibition. In the multi-dimensional interpreter's knowledge network activation spreads from node to node based on associative links. This activation is a means of stochastic or fuzzy recognition used in the genetic selection algorithm.","Activation Wave","This expression represents the serial flow of excitation and\/or inhibition triggered by a single input in a natural or artificial neural network. Natural and artificial neural networks can exhibit directional or chaotic flow of activation. An example of directional activation flow in a natural system is the human visual cortex which has multiple layers and through which activation flows sequentially from the back to the front, then on into the correlation and interpretation centers of the brain. Consequently, the deconstruction of the image in the brain's visual center is an output of a relatively directional wave of activation flow.","Once in the correlation and interpretation centers, the flow becomes much less directional or more chaotic. Activation flows in parallel to many specialized areas of the brain. These processing centers respond by sending back activation patterns that contribute to the emergent phenomena of recognition and interpretation that go on to support all cognitive functions. Whether directional or not, the path of any activation flow in a neural system can be traced backward from the point (neuron or node) where the flow stops to the point where it began, no matter how much it spreads or branches out in the process. The collection of all such serial paths triggered by a single input constitutes what we call a wave.","The complexity of the input may be arbitrary, but the more complex the input, the more complex the wave will be, hence the more difficult to trace. The science of tracing activation waves in the brain is not yet mature enough to trace the entire path of activation flow either backward or forward from neuron to neuron for a given input. Artificial systems, however, can be traced. Mimicking human activation flow patterns is one of the key objectives of many artificial neural systems.","Consciousness","In humans, consciousness is an emergent cognitive phenomenon usually active whenever one or more of the senses is perceptually active. Other cognitive phenomena, such as attention, derive from consciousness and may be described as \u201cheightened states of consciousness\u201d. In the multi-dimensional interpreter, consciousness is a state of accepting and processing input while maintaining a broader map of the spatial, temporal, commercial, and social context associated with its primary user.","Context","Context is a snapshot of the universe from a specific point of view to a specific depth. If the viewpoint is that of an astronomer at work, it could begin at her desk and include a radius of many thousands of light years. If the viewpoint is that of an electron in an inert substance, the context would encompass a very small distance. Context includes locations in space, points in time, activities, ideas, intentions, communications, motion, change, stasis, and any describable thing associated with the person, place, or thing to which the context applies.","Counterfactual","A counterfactual is a proposition that states that a certain associative proposition or causal link is unlikely, thus it spreads negative or inhibitory activation.","Disambiguation","Disambiguation is the process of resolving ambiguity, especially in words, symbols, or phrases that carry multiple possible meanings (polysemy). This is necessary for accurate interpretation of input human language text or utterances. Context is needed to disambiguate polysemous input.","Doping","In a genetic algorithm, doping is the process of introducing random or quasi-random variables into the equation, population or gene pool to affect the process, the output, or both. In this context quasi-random may mean; based on a random number generator, based on random selection of targets to which to apply variables, or based on non-random variables applied in a non-random way, but in which the variables have no describable association with the core interpretive processes or the targets to which the variables are applied.","Emergence","The term \u201cemergent behavior\u201d has been applied to the human brain and other complex systems whose internal behavior involves non-deterministic functionality or is so complex, or involves the interaction of so many pieces, that tracing the process from beginning to end is not possible or not feasible. Because of the power of computers and their ability to track internal activity, it is not possible to produce 100% untraceable processes just as it is not possible to produce a random number generator that is actually random and not ostensibly random. Information is said to \u201cemerge\u201d because it cannot be traced back to its source. In the context of the multi-dimensional interpreter, emergence is a computational behavior that mimics the inventor's understanding of the behavior of the human brain processes used to interpret human language.","Encoding Scheme","A way of representing something using a tightly specified symbol or object set. ASCII and EBCDIC are encoding schemes for symbol systems for alphabetic and numeric symbols. In this document, encoding scheme refers to a specific design for structuring language knowledge facts and real-world knowledge facts in the form of words and other human and machine readable symbols into conceptually relevant associations that can support automated or computerized access and processing. Human languages are such encoding schemes, but their irregularities make it difficult for use in their normal form for automated processing. Well-formed syllogisms or other logical statements with a finite set of connectors and operators are a more regular encoding scheme for knowledge of facts.","Expectation","Expectation is a concept that is relatively foreign to computing but essential to achieving high accuracy in natural language interpretation. Expectation is an a-priori set of contextual markers that describe a world familiar to the multi-dimensional interpreter system based on the world familiar to the human user. The more the system knows about the primary users and their surroundings, the better it will be able to determine the users' intentions based on the words they submit to the system.","Fitness","Fitness is a characteristic of a candidate solution or a part thereof. In a genetic selection process, survival-of-the-fittest is used to differentiate possible solutions and enable the one or more fittest solutions to emerge victorious.","Genetic Selection","Genetic Selection is a process of survival-of-the-fittest in which fitness algorithms are applied to multiple possible solutions and only the best survive each generation. Unlike winner-take-all processes in which only the single best candidate solution emerges, genetic selection can yield multiple surviving solutions in each generation. Then, as successive generations are processed, survivors from previous generations may die off if the succeeding generations are more fit.","Inference","For the purpose of this invention inference involves correlating multiple constraints contained in input and derived from other sources, and drawing conclusions based on testing the relative truth of multiple propositions affecting each constraint. Inference is what humans constantly do with our brains. Based on perceptions, humans make inferences about meaning, about the state of things, about consequences of actions, and about life, the universe, and everything. Inference involves applying logic to new information derived from our senses and remembered information stored somehow in the brain to form conclusions. Forming conclusions is important because the conclusions form a basis for correct interpretation and appropriate further processing. A characteristic of the conclusions drawn by the multi-dimensional interpreter is that it can abandon one quickly if newer information prompts it to do so.","Knowledge","For the purpose of this invention, the term knowledge means correlated information. This definition is part of a larger continuum in which everything interpretable can be assigned to some point on the continuum. The position of knowledge in this continuum can be described in terms of its complexity relative to other things in the environment that are interpretable. The level of facts that we can learn and describe in simple phrases is called existential knowledge or data. Data is the kind of knowledge expressed in almanacs. At the complex end of the knowledge continuum is one or more levels of meta-knowledge or knowledge about knowledge.","The term \u201cnoise\u201d is borrowed from radio wave theory to describe interpretable things that interfere with the interpretation of or acquisition of knowledge. Noise, the simplest of all interpretable things, is made up of things in the perceptual environment or input that are less meaningful than data. An interpretation system must be able to process noise because it is omnipresent. Thus, a system must have knowledge that enables it to sort out the noise from the salient data, though this may be more of an attention function than actual knowledge. Once the noise in the environment is filtered out, all that remains is data, which can be correlated to constitute knowledge.","Data elements that humans process are input in the form of perceptual stimuli to the five senses. The specific types of data available are tactile sensations, tastes, smells, sounds and images. These perceptual inputs are processed in specialized areas of the brain, correlated in parallel, then used as the basis for cognitive processing. The multi-dimensional interpreter algorithms are primarily designed to interpret human language, but are also able to be generalized to interpret the other forms of sensory input described above.","Knowledge Base","The multi-dimensional interpreter uses a knowledge base that contains the basic information about things in the world and the way they are interrelated.","Knowledge Network","A massively interconnected network of information about how linguistic and real-world objects relate to one another.","Lexicon","Lexicon is a list of words, letters, numbers, and\/or phrases used in a natural language, such as English, that express meaning or facts or represent objects or phenomena. The lexicon consists of a list of lexical items or objects, each a word or symbol or combination thereof. In the multi-dimensional interpreter the lexicon is part of the Knowledge Base.","Multi-Dimensional Processing","In this document, multi-dimensional processing refers to an approach of using an automated device or computer to analyze a string of input data, such as a sentence in English, from more than one perspective. Perspectives or dimensions include, for example, grammar or syntax, semantics, pragmatics, context, and morphology.","Mutation","A genetic algorithm mutation is a process of altering the characteristics of a candidate solution or a part thereof during the course of processing. The mutated result then can compete with other results for fitness as a solution.","Natural Language Processing","Natural language processing means using computers to analyze natural language input, such as English sentences, for the purpose of interpretation, paraphrasing, or translation.","Neural","Of, resembling, or having to do with the processing components and functions of the brain and\/or its cells. Perceptual, inquisitive, communicative, interpretive, creative, and decisive cognitive processes occur in the brain through the functioning of its network of neuron cells. Those processes are neural, and automated processes designed to resemble the structure and\/or functions of these processes are often characterized as neural.","Object","An object is a discreet string of one or more symbols or characters that has a beginning and an end and an unchanging content. If the content were to change through the addition, subtraction, or modification of one or more of its characters, it would become a different object.","Object Base","A set of lists of objects in which each list contains a collection of like objects. One such list is the lexicon whose constituent objects are all lexical items. Another such list is the sound base, which contains a list of sounds as machine-readable representations such as .wav files. The object base may also contain an image base holding a collection of images such as .gif and .jpeg files. Other lists, such as video, aroma, and tactile object lists can also be stored as object bases. The object bases are part of the knowledge base.","Polysemy","The linguistic phenomenon of multiple meanings applying to a single word, symbol, or phrase.","Real-World Knowledge","Real world knowledge includes facts about phenomena and things. In this document, real-world knowledge refers to information or data associated with other information or data in a meaningful or expressive way to represent facts in the world. Some facts describe the hierarchical relations between classes and subclasses of objects in the real world such as \u201ca dog is Canine in the animal kingdom\u201d. Other facts describe causal relations such as \u201cgravity pulls physical objects toward each other\u201d, and yet others describe constructive relations such as \u201ca knob is part of a door\u201d.","Stochastic","Non-deterministic or \u201cfuzzy\u201d processing techniques and encoding approaches that deliver output from a process that is virtually impossible to determine based on the inputs because of the sheer number of permutations and\/or the complexity of the weighting mechanisms and processes to adjust weights during the course of the process and prior to the output.","The theory underlying the invention disclosed herein comes from several academic disciplines whose collective work was required to solve problems plaguing all who have sought and are seeking to automate language understanding. Those disciplines include:\n\n","When humans communicate by speaking or writing, they assume that they do not have to begin by sharing all their knowledge about the world so that the recipients can understand what they are saying, but they do assume that the recipients share a huge body of knowledge about the world. In fact, communications are often tailored to address the recipients' expected or perceived knowledge level. In order for a computational system to approximate adult human performance, the system must begin with a corresponding body or world knowledge.","The lexicon and molecules in the knowledge network are dynamic building blocks of successful interpretation. They are dynamic because new lexical entries can be added, new propositions can be added and confidence values of propositions can be changed. The primary processes of interpretation are based on comparing input with this network of propositions, determining the likelihood that specific propositions apply and are true, then delivering the set of the most applicable and likely propositions as the solution or interpretation.","To manage the combinatorial explosion of possibilities, the multi-dimensional interpreter makes no attempt to describe any of the possible interpretations of a sentence or utterance in the knowledge base, but describes components of solutions associated with words and phrases. This mirrors the way people assemble words and phrases to communicate intent. The knowledge base, therefore, attempts to describe each possible solution of each object that is a component of any possible input text or utterance. This approach assumes that most presented inputs will have a sufficient mass of solvable or interpretable components, and that the aggregation of the solved components will be sufficient to describe an acceptable interpretation of the input. It also assumes that the more accurately and dependably the system can resolve the individual objects as components, the more accurate the final interpretation will be.","The problem of polysemy applies to words, phrases and sentences with multiple meanings. Learning and delivering individual solutions to polysemy at the lexical word and phrase levels makes the multi-dimensional interpreter better able to solve aggregate problems of phrase and sentence ambiguity, therefore increasing the accuracy of interpretation. Humans resolve ambiguity using knowledge about the real world. Without the context of the real-world knowledge, the problem of polysemy is too difficult to solve.","The multi-dimensional interpreter requires a massive amount of information about the physical and abstract things in the real world as well as information about linguistic patterns and structures and their interrelationships. The atomic or basic components of this information are encoded in an object base with a lexicon holding lexical entries or objects. These objects can be letters, words, numbers and characters that are not alpha-numeric, but are used commonly in communication. The knowledge network associates these lexical objects with one another in contextually specific logical propositions resembling molecules.","The underlying theory behind the reliance on a lexicon to represent the basic elements or atoms of knowledge is that all human knowledge is represented by words and phrases, and if we cannot describe it using a word or a phrase, we do not know it. As humankind learns and develops new knowledge, new words and phrases are coined. The multi-dimensional interpreter is able to add new words, phrases and other objects to the lexicon to represent knowledge that is new to the system or new to humankind. The knowledge base also contains object bases of non-lexical items such as sounds and images to broaden interpretation capabilities.","To build smart processes, knowledge must be stored intelligently and efficiently. The multi-dimensional interpreter stores the interrelationship information in a massive network of symbolic propositions associated by explicit links. This network is analogous to long-term memory (LTM) in humans. In order to get at this knowledge, the lexicon is used to provide direct access to each proposition in the network associated with that lexical entry or object. Non-lexical objects can also be used to access the knowledge network. This direct access is analogous to a content-addressable mechanism for reading information in long-term memory.","Because of the massive size of the knowledge network and the fact that only small portion of that knowledge will be needed to interpret any given sentence or paragraph, the salient information discovered through searching the knowledge network is moved into a temporary processing area that is preferably optimized short-term memory (STM). While knowledge or information in long-term memory is persistent, the contents of short-term memory are frequently changed and modified during the course of processing.","This invention includes a symbolic processing model representing human short-term memory and a specialized part of the brain called the hippocampus. Evidence suggests that the hippocampus provides a cognitive map of the environment in which a human being is at, at any given time. For animals, whose olfactory sense is critical to survival, the hippocampus appears to play a role in mapping the immediate spatial environment (where one is at a given time).","This type of cognitive map may be primarily visual. On the other hand, the dominant senses in animal behavior are those used for survival: sight, sound, and smell. Coordination of a spatial template of the food-gathering environment and an olfactory path to the location of the food would provide animals with a good survival mechanism.","To interpret complex inputs from multiple senses, we need some kind of context to act as a framework for understanding. This notion treats the perceiver as the central point in the context of what is being perceived. In some ways, this is analogous to treating the brain as a central component of a larger process in which the flow of chemicals and fluids and electricity are not segregated in a closed system but are part of a much larger network of cooperating subsystems.","Furthermore, although the function of the hippocampus is not fully understood, likely role of the hippocampus in cognition is to serve as a contextual map of the environment. for instance, when a person is in a familiar place, such as a kitchen or living room, certain sounds will cue attention. The same sounds in a factory, hospital, automobile, or coal mine could well be ignored or not even registered. The environmental map makes possible such feats as disarming the alarm clock without totally waking up or navigating through the house without turning on the lights. Because of the pivotal role apparently played by the hippocampus in cognition, some artificial neural networks describe a correlating layer as the hippocampus. This is a reasonable approach because cognition, recognition, and comprehension are thought to require more than a reaction in the area of the brain that receives and processes the input.","This invention introduces a new strategy for representing knowledge in an arbitrarily large network of compact propositions. It further introduces an efficient mechanism for extracting salient propositions, organizing them by context in multi-dimensional structures that are functionally similar to human short-term memory, and processing them using methods resembling the chaotic flow of electrical potentials in the human brain. The present invention describes applications using the knowledge network and language processing methods to interpret the meaning of input text, then performs actions such as engaging in natural language dialog to assist users, and\/or translating the input text into other natural languages.","The massive knowledge network is similar to a Bayesian network in that weights attached to each proposition serve as a-priori probabilities. The method, however, extracts these weighted propositions from the knowledge network, and groups them by context in multi-dimensional structures simulating human short-term memory. There they are exposed to processes that simulate the flow of positive (excitatory) and negative (inhibitory) potentials that modify their weights causing some to increase and others to remain unchanged or decrease.","This invention does not parse sentences, but uses hybrid techniques that resemble neural network processes, for example, Bayesian network structures, employing genetic or evolutionary algorithm methods to permit the invention to derive more than one \u201csurviving\u201d gene or solution. Most parsers only use information about all the possible syntactic roles that apply to any given word. This invention preferably uses all the syntactic, semantic, and real-world knowledge that applies to any given object as the basis for correctly determining the meaning of each object in a sentence or ordered sequence of written or spoken human language.","While using the neural network strategies of simulating the flow of electrical potentials in the brain and learning through back propagation, this invention overcomes several weaknesses of most existing neural networks. First, training is more straightforward and less redundant. Second, the input and output can be arbitrarily complex without sacrificing accuracy while most existing neural networks are generally limited to two or three-dimensional problems. This limitation arises from the widely accepted model of storing no explicit values of knowledge, but implicitly representing the learned information in the overall weighting between the complex, but individually meaningless aggregation of simple, ordered nodes in a neural network. In addition, the directional flow of potentials in most existing neural networks limits their ability to simulate human cognitive activity.","This invention overcomes the implicit knowledge weakness by using network nodes with explicit values that are complex propositions describing real-world knowledge. Learning occurs by adding and correcting propositions. Like connectionist neural networks, this invention uses brain-like processes simulating the flow of excitatory and inhibitory electrical potentials to cause correct propositions regarding meaning to \u201cheat up\u201d or emerge. Thus, the multi-dimensional model consists of complex nodes containing explicit information in a non-directional, non-ordered, or chaotic network structure. One advance of this invention is the ability to access salient information among hundreds of thousands to millions of explicit nodes in the multi-dimensional network.","The explicit information in the multi-dimensional network also overcomes the training weakness of most existing neural networks. The multi-dimensional network training process involves adding new information to the knowledge network and changing knowledge in the knowledge network by adjusting weights of vectors of specifically targeted propositions. New information is added in the forms of new lexical and non-lexical object entries, new propositions comprised of a plurality of objects, and new associations between objects and\/or propositions. Furthermore, this invention may be utilized to store and differentiate general knowledge useful for a broad range of applications and users, from domain specific and user specific knowledge.","Because the propositions are composed primarily of words in human languages such as English, the propositions are readable by people who have no special training. Consequently, anyone who speaks the language can \u201cteach\u201d the interpreter about facts in the real world. Adding knowledge to the network expands the ability of the interpreter to recognize and interpret objects and propositions. Knowledge that is already in the network is changed by adjusting the weight associated with a proposition. The aggregation of such changes creates measurable aggregate changes in the behavior of the system enabling it to increase accuracy of interpretation. Though some of the embodiments herein refer specifically to treatment of the English language, any specific embodiment of the unique methods or apparatus of the present invention may be applied to all human languages because the differences between languages require no adjustment to the algorithms or schema, but only to the data objects stored within the same schema.","This invention overcomes a weakness of Bayesian networks in that the greater the number of nodes and connections in a Bayesian network, the poorer the performance. Like neural networks, most Bayesian networks require a process of analyzing all the nodes in sequence from one side to the other. Most of nodes may be irrelevant and useless in the determination of the solution, but they are processed every time regardless. This invention, by gaining direct access to the salient nodes (propositions) in the network through the object base, and placing these nodes in different structures in memory, enables very rapid processing of complex probabilities. It, in effect, uses the input words as a basis for finding those nodes in the network that are most likely to impact the solution and ignores all other nodes in the network.","Comparing and mutually reinforcing the probabilities of the applicability of the propositions leads to an emergent phenomenon of understanding the correct meaning or meanings for each object in a sentence or sequence, thus making it possible to interpret the sentence or sequence with human-like accuracy. To increase efficiency further, this invention includes embodiments in which the propositions are encoded or compressed into forms that are not human-readable.","Additionally, this invention defines a slightly more complex, but highly efficient schema for storing real-world knowledge in a Bayesian style network. This schema optimizes the semantic expressiveness present in the objects. Because this knowledge representation scheme is constituted of a massive collection of compact statements of propositional logic, the metaphor of atoms and molecules is a useful theoretical model. The schema is defined as a network of linked molecules, each molecule comprising a plurality of objects or \u201catoms\u201d with defined functions or meanings. These atoms are typically words in a lexicon, but can also be non-lexical objects such as graphic, sound, or video files. For convenience, letters are assigned to each atomic object such that the head object is assigned the letter \u201cx\u201d and the associated object the letter \u201cy\u201d. Complexity may arise from the use of a variety of explicit relation object (\u201cr\u201d) terms, the presence of an object that represents the context object (\u201cc\u201d), and\/or a qualifier object (\u201cq\u201d) that constrains the proposition and permits the existence of contradictory propositions for the same object in different contexts.","There are generally two aspects of genetic or evolutionary algorithms the interpreter uses. First, genetic algorithms use doping procedures that introduce random variables into formulas to simulate genetic mutation. The interpreter introduces quasi-random variables into the flow of potentials in the process to disrupt and focus the progress of emergence. Second, the genetic algorithm construct that permits more than one gene or solution to \u201csurvive\u201d may be used by the invention to determine if there are more than one intended or inferable meanings in the input text.","Although currently available hardware may be used for processing the algorithms and the structure of propositions in the knowledge representation schema, embodiments of this invention also include hardware apparatus optimally designed to support these structures and processes.","Hardware optimizations embodied in this invention include devices that can physically attach to automated devices. These devices include:","A multi-dimensional interpreter server that can attach to a general purpose computer through an expansion adaptor such as a passive backplane and provide server-attached interpretation and translation services. This device may utilize proprietary and\/or open standard interfaces to make interpretation services available to operating systems, applications and other services attached to the same network or server. For example, an embodiment of the open standard implementation uses Simple Object Access Protocol (SOAP), a currently available Application Programming Interface (API) as a basis for inter-process communication between operating systems, applications and other services and the multi-dimensional interpreter device. For example, SOAP could be used to attach this device to a voice response system of an automated call center attendant or directly to a phone switch to provide real-time interpretation and\/or translation services.","A multi-dimensional interpreter expansion card that can attach to a computer bus and provide interpretation and translation services. An embodiment of the expansion card implementation uses a PCI Bus, a currently available expansion slot common to desktop computers. Another embodiment provides computational services to devices attached to a network using a passive backplane common to currently available server and telecommunications applications.","A knowledge appliance with a human language interface that serves as a portable, handheld, or wearable computing device using spoken language as the primary input mechanism.","An intelligent, wired telecommunication device capable of listening to and translating voice messages, such as messages recorded by a telephone answering system. Such a system may be tailored for consumers and\/or serve as a universal messaging system for commercial and\/or corporate applications.","An intelligent, wireless telecommunication device capable of listening to and translating voice messages, such as messages recorded by a telephone answering system. Such a system may be tailored for consumers and\/or serve as a universal messaging system for commercial and\/or corporate applications.","The invention includes a multi-dimensional natural language processing (NLP) computational system with components and processes that understand and act upon spoken, written, and other forms of human language. The system operates on real-world knowledge stored in a distributed knowledge network () that exhibits neural network-like structure and content, and uses algorithms to mimic certain brain functions (). The algorithms are preferably optimized to rapidly access and process stored knowledge to interpret the meaning of human language text, and\/or perform further processing such as initiating searches or automated business functions, or translating the human language input text from one language to one or more other languages.","The invention embodies a multi-dimensional knowledge network in which each grouping of objects forms a proposition describing real-world knowledge. These propositional groupings consist of objects, including lexical () and\/or non-lexical objects (), arranged in a specific order similar to the structure of a molecule. The lexical and non-lexical objects are the atomic structure in the system, and the propositions are the molecular structure. Each molecular proposition may have a weight. When present, the weight of a proposition can be used as its confidence value or probability, for stochastic or fuzzy processing. Adjusting weights in this system is analogous to cognitive learning in a biological organism and is similar in behavior to calculating posterior probabilities in a Bayesian process.

Many of these are heuristic algorithms and may be triggered by the contents of proposition molecules. In one embodiment, a limited set of objects are assigned as relations [r] and contexts [c]. In such an embodiment, the atoms that most commonly trigger heuristic processes are relations [r] and contexts [c].","Internal Structure of the Interpreter","The above description provides a scheme and structures for forming a knowledge network (). This information is preferably stored in a memory architecture in a digital, analog, or other machine readable format. In order to access the structure efficiently, a gateway structure is preferable. In one embodiment of the present invention, a list is provided as a gateway. The list is composed of a plurality of objects, wherein each object is represented only once in the list. The list may contain both lexical objects (this portion of the list forms a lexicon-) and\/or non-lexical objects (this portion of the list forms an extended lexicon-), referred to collectively, the lexicon and extended lexicon may simply be referred to as an object base that may contain lexical and\/or non-lexical objects.","Generally, to those skilled in the art, a lexicon is a collection of lexical objects that constitute the vocabulary of a language. Similarly, in the multi-dimensional interpreter, the entries in the object base are intended to represent the objects needed to describe the body of human knowledge understood by the system. In order to know about anything, the system utilizing such a list provides an object that can be used to describe or represent that thing. These objects serve as the gateway into the multi-dimensional knowledge network and the nodes in the network. Because each element in a knowledge molecule consists of an object, the object base must possess a corresponding element before a propositional molecule possessing that object can be constructed.","The object base typically may not contain definitions of any of the words or other objects. To serve as a gateway, it may contain links into the knowledge network, whereby a chaining process can be used to connect the objects to encoded knowledge about their meaning and relationships with other objects in the object base. An object in the object base can be an arbitrary combination of characters that bear meaning, as long as it corresponds to something in the human conceptual vocabulary or understanding.","Adding to the Object Base","Two constraints that govern the determination of what goes into the object base are meaningfulness and efficiency. In order to determine meaningfulness, any object considered for entry into the lexicon should fit into one of the positions in a proposition (x, r, y, c, or q). If a valid propositional molecule can be constructed using the proposed object in its entirety as one of the atoms in the molecule, that object is determined to be meaningful.","For maximum efficiency, each atom in a molecule should be indivisible. Indivisibility means that removing any part of the object would change its meaning in the context of one or more knowledge molecules in which the object correctly fits. Indivisibility does not preclude compound lexical objects as described above. For example, the acronym \u201cPOTUS\u201d refers to the compound lexical object \u201cPresident of the United States\u201d. Though each of the words may be distinct lexical objects, the aggregation of these words in the preferred sequence bears a specific meaning in a narrowly defined context such as \u201cUnited States Government\u201d.","The organization of objects in the object base may be optimized for the computing platform on which the system resides. For computing platforms with limited memory and storage resources, the structure is of a single alphabetical list. For computing platforms with significant memory and storage resources, the object base is divided into multiple areas in which each of the areas contain objects having similar characteristics.","The object base is a one-dimensional structure or list. It is structured as a list to facilitate and expedite search. As a list, the object base may be decomposed into a hash table to support high-speed search. A relative pointer can be used to reference each object so that, rather than spelling out the entire object each time it is referenced, the pointer can be used as a synonym for the object. One of the primary characteristics that govern object storage is object length. Due to the hash mechanisms that may be used for searching the object base, alphabetic order is not a prerequisite for efficiency or operability.","Structure of a Molecule Forming a Proposition",{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0117","num":"0140"},"figref":"FIG. 1","b":["101","102","103","104","105"]},{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0118","num":"0141"},"tables":{"@attributes":{"id":"TABLE-US-00005","num":"00005"},"table":{"@attributes":{"frame":"none","colsep":"0","rowsep":"0"},"tgroup":{"@attributes":{"align":"left","colsep":"0","rowsep":"0","cols":"5"},"colspec":[{"@attributes":{"colname":"1","colwidth":"56pt","align":"center"}},{"@attributes":{"colname":"2","colwidth":"21pt","align":"center"}},{"@attributes":{"colname":"3","colwidth":"63pt","align":"center"}},{"@attributes":{"colname":"4","colwidth":"35pt","align":"center"}},{"@attributes":{"colname":"5","colwidth":"42pt","align":"center"}}],"thead":{"row":[{"entry":{"@attributes":{"namest":"1","nameend":"5","align":"center","rowsep":"1"}}},{"entry":["x","r","y","c","w"]},{"entry":{"@attributes":{"namest":"1","nameend":"5","align":"center","rowsep":"1"}}}]},"tbody":{"@attributes":{"valign":"top"},"row":[{"entry":["Saturn","name","planet","astronomy",".6"]},{"entry":{"@attributes":{"namest":"1","nameend":"5","align":"center","rowsep":"1"}}}]}}}},"br":{},"ul":{"@attributes":{"id":"ul0006","list-style":"none"},"li":{"@attributes":{"id":"ul0006-0001","num":"0000"},"ul":{"@attributes":{"id":"ul0007","list-style":"none"},"li":["Binary Logic: Two-valued or dichotomous logic deals with Trues and Falses without anything in between.","Multi-valued Logic: Scales of belief, confidence, or even truth are applied to declarations to express their likelihood, credibility or probability."]}}}},"Confidence values are used in inference processes to select among multiple possible interpretations, decisions, or solutions.

Using the Bayesian formulas supporting the interpreter, this plurality of structures supports efficient mechanisms to determine individual probabilities of each proposition being relevant to the solution. Segregation of specified contexts facilitates this divide-and-conquer approach. Decomposing the problem treats the propositional constraints independently with their own probability vectors (), thus using the values of each early constraint to determine likelihood and narrow the possible scope of later or posterior constraints.","Temporal () and spatial () reasoning are necessary for human beings and autonomous vehicles to navigate and reach destinations without colliding with obstacles. In addition to this obvious application of space and time, many less obvious domains of knowledge involve spatial and temporal constraints. As an example, whenever a product is shipped from a vendor to a customer, the shipment travels through space and time. Specialized context structures described in this illustration may bear responsibility for this reasoning by holding attributes () associated with space (location, origin, destination, route . . . ) and time (starting time, scheduled arrival, actual arrival, delay . . . ) and other contexts.","A taxonomy context structure () may be responsible for resolving classification associations that lead to correct interpretation. For example, a cat is classified as feline in species mammalia, in vertebrata, in the animal kingdom, unless the word is used as slang to refer to a human being (such as in the colloquialism \u201cfat cat\u201d). In the knowledge network, hierarchical relations may be stored with all other types of associations including ascriptive propositions. Nouns that describe people, places, and things may be described in the knowledge network with hierarchical and ascriptive relations. Thus, it may be possible to infer that a word is acting as a noun when enough hierarchical propositions fire.","Taxonomical context structures may possess at least one more dimension than other types of context structures because of the generational nature of taxonomy and the direct association of attributes and inheritance. The dimensions of a network of this type may be ordered as follows:\n\n","In causal reasoning, especially in attempting to find missing information or anaphora, a risk exists for the system to identify coincidental co-occurrences as causally linked. The multi-dimensional interpreter uses a threshold parameter that is high enough to filter out and distinguish coincidence from rational causal analysis. This parameter is determined during the verification-learning phase through empirical verification against a large set of coincidental observations and other sentences with actual missing causal constraints.","The context structure responsible for containing and processing these relations is called the causality context structure (). For interpreting lexical input, the dimensions may be formed as follows:\n\n","The system processes input text by finding propositions that could be linked to each word or object in the text, and placing these propositions into a set of contexts that may or may not help determine the intent of the speaker. The processes that change the vectors associated with each proposition may then show which propositions and which contexts apply to the solution, and which do not. Causal, temporal, spatial and hierarchical contexts are likely to apply to a wide variety of possible inputs. The system also may create very narrow contexts, such as \u201cRoman mythology\u201d and\/or \u201cautomobiles\u201d, one of which may be germane to understanding the intent and\/or meaning of a word such as \u201cSaturn\u201d.","Regularities in data can lead to reasonable causal conclusions in humans.

On the other hand, the correct assertion that \u201cAll people who ate pickles in 1875 are now dead\u201d does not establish a proper causal link between pickles and death. Consequently, it is not the goal of the multi-dimensional interpreter to establish causal links unless it is necessary to achieve an accurate interpretation and subsequent processes. Generating a correct paraphrase is an indicator of correct interpretation.","To achieve the goal of correct paraphrases, the multi-dimensional interpreter may attempt to establish causal links. Because of the inherent complexity of the kindergarten example, no causal link would be established. Because of the deceptive nature of the pickle example, a deceptive causal link may be established in generating a paraphrase. A verbose paraphrase might state, \u201cAll individuals who consumed a food item called pickles in the year 1875 perished from food-borne pathogens.\u201d This would represent the system's interpretation of the speaker's intent in making that statement implying a causal link.","Processing an Input String",{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0195","num":"0258"},"figref":"FIG. 10","b":["1001","1002"]},"The interpreter then scans the individual objects and searches the object base () for a matching object.

Over a short period of time in the interpretation process, the vector may rise and fall any number of times producing an undulating or spiking curve rather than a simple sigmoidal curve. An infinite variety of possible curves exist and depend on the interaction of the input and the knowledge in the network.","The stochastic processes that determine and adjust the fitness of each candidate, attribute, and context structure in the multi-dimensional interpreter operate at the atomic level. This is generally necessary because disambiguation is an atomic level operation that must successfully find the correct meaning or meanings for each object, such as a symbol, word, or phrase. This is possible because every context structure (), attribute (), and candidate () possesses direct ties to knowledge in the knowledge network both at the atomic and molecular levels. In the genetic or evolutionary metaphor, the rise and fall of atomic object vectors can form the primary mechanism of genetic selection.","From a propositional logic perspective, the fitness of an object is determined from the truth values of the propositions at the molecular level. But unlike typical methods for mapping truth values, such as Venn diagrams or truth tables, the multi-dimensional interpreter preferably uses activation values that are derived from wave processes and doping. Under this structure, the starting value of a vector's object comes directly from the a-priori weight of a proposition (, ) in a knowledge network ().

The multi-dimensional interpreter processes may be designed to mimic this emergent behavior. This imitation is achieved through the use of multiple complex contextual constraints (), genetic algorithms to assign, adjust and analyze the fitness of multiple candidates (), attributes () and contexts (), and threshold logic ().","Threshold logic in the multi-dimensional interpreter involves mathematical functions applied to vectors to determine if the magnitude of a vector (, , ) is sufficient to merit attention. This logic conceptually places a bar below which activation is insufficient to emerge to consciousness () and above which attention is drawn to a vector. This bar is expressed as a numerical value that is within range of the expected activation potential of vectors to which the threshold applies. Different thresholds may be applied to different vectors and the thresholds for a single vector or for multiple vectors may be adjusted during the course of processing. Because the thresholds are adjustable, the mathematical function of the threshold is a sigmoidal curve ().","Context structure containers () may be a fundamental structure in the multi-dimensional interpreter because they exhibit emergent behavior. The three levels of vectors, container or context level (), attribute level (), and candidate level (), each possess activation levels that represent the fitness of each object. The threshold factor applicable to each of these levels determines whether or not the vector, with its associated object, emerges to consciousness. At or above threshold magnitude (), an object at any level is said to emerge or attract attention. Parameters in the system define how many emergent objects in each category are fit enough to survive.","Determining the emergence of candidates in a single attribute of a context structure can be compared to a children's game in which an object is hidden in a room and the person who hid the object guides the contestant to the object by telling them they are getting hotter or colder. The nearer they approach the object, the hotter they are, and the further they are, the colder. In the multi-dimensional interpreter system, candidate, attribute, and context structure vectors figuratively heat up and cool down. An automated interpreter agent searches through all hot context structures for hot attributes and selects the hot candidates (surviving genes) based on magnitude and rate of change, for resolutions to the meaning of the input.","Depending on the stage of the genetic selection process at the time of emergence of any given object vector, the results can be different. The word attention, in the context of emergence, can be applied as the final interpretation of a part of input when emergence occurs at or near the end of the interpretation process. When emergence occurs earlier, it can trigger additional processes such as spawning a new wave of activation in the knowledge network, in short-term memory or both. The new wave of activation has the potential to increase and\/or decrease the magnitude of the vector object that spawned the wave, thus potentially forcing it below threshold and deselecting it.","Preferably, the process of selection is based on aggregate activation generated through neural processes in a knowledge network. This process applied to each individual candidate is probabilistic in that the emergence of winning or surviving genes arises from analyzing the probability that this proposition applies to the current input. In other words, each increment of positive and negative activation applied to each candidate respectively increases and decreases the probability that the recipient candidate will emerge victorious. Hence, each increment of activation bolsters or weakens the probability that the recipient proposition will be found true and applicable to solving the problem needed to resolve the meaning of the input.","It is preferred that each context structure vector (), attribute vector (), and candidate object vector () possesses both a direction and a numeric level of activation.

Activation can also be implemented, for example, as two states: 1) below threshold and 2) at or above threshold or \u201cfired\u201d, which yields only six possible states. Both the direction and activation can be calculated from the vector weight, the previous vector weight, and new activation flow potentials. The original vector weight and other constraints can also be combined, to make the state more expressive or richer.","The multi-dimensional interpreter's use of spreading activation (, ) proactively draws attention to good candidate meanings. This makes the vectors representing the good candidates rise or emerge (, ). Other candidates should rise less, retain their a-priori weights, or fall. Because the system is non-deterministic, however, the potential for false positives and false negatives, is significant for any single word in a sentence. The multi-dimensional interpreter's combination of contextual (), semantic (), syntactic () and morphological analysis (), however, mitigates the affect of false positives and false negatives by providing quality checks at each level.","Maximum probability prediction leads to higher error rate, thus the system suppresses maximums during the doping cycles (). Weight annealing is a type of formula () used to take a hyper-extended spike associated with a single attribute or candidate, and push it down one or more steps. This is a bias correction function that creates a smoothing effect on the plot of the overall solution. The multi-dimensional interpreter uses past experience and multi-layered analysis functions to determine the appropriate annealing factors for smoothing elevated candidates, thus automatically propagating to their attribute () and context structure () vectors. Such a formula may be described as follows:\n\n","Many other such formulas may serve as part of a fitness algorithm. When input contains too many unmatched objects, it is possible that no candidates will emerge or survive. In this case the primary strategy is to seek clarification (). When input is disjoint or poorly formed, there is a chance that the plot of posterior Bayesian probability will exhibit high peaks of activation with low valleys in between. The low valleys represent missing concepts or gaps. The combination of seeking clarification and the fitness algorithm should be sufficient to bring about an emergent solution.","As a result of the initiatory action of wave activation and the correlative process of the survival algorithm, patterns may emerge in short-term memory. The patterns in the combined context structures may be represented as hot spots where the weights of certain propositions significantly exceed the average weight of the network as a whole and of the portion of the network temporarily active in short-term memory.

During a venture into record territory, the mathematical phenomenon contains four operative numbers:\n\n","The behavior of these numbers is as follows:","As long as the team continues to produce wins without a loss, a) remains equivalent to b) and b) grows at a constant rate with c) while d) remains static. With a loss, c) returns to 0 and d) grows incrementally while a) and b) remain static.","For example, if a team's current season win loss record is 15 wins and 2 losses, and 15 is the highest number of wins for the team in any previous season, and they have won the last 8 games then:",{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0283","num":"0372"},"tables":{"@attributes":{"id":"TABLE-US-00020","num":"00020"},"table":{"@attributes":{"frame":"none","colsep":"0","rowsep":"0"},"tgroup":{"@attributes":{"align":"left","colsep":"0","rowsep":"0","cols":"3"},"colspec":[{"@attributes":{"colname":"offset","colwidth":"21pt","align":"left"}},{"@attributes":{"colname":"1","colwidth":"133pt","align":"left"}},{"@attributes":{"colname":"2","colwidth":"63pt","align":"char"}}],"thead":{"row":{"entry":[{},{"@attributes":{"namest":"offset","nameend":"2","align":"center","rowsep":"1"}}]}},"tbody":{"@attributes":{"valign":"top"},"row":[{"entry":[{},"a) Number of wins constituting the record =","15"]},{"entry":[{},"b) Number of total wins =","15"]},{"entry":[{},"c) Length of the current streak =","8"]},{"entry":[{},"d) Number of losses =","2"]},{"entry":[{},{"@attributes":{"namest":"offset","nameend":"2","align":"center","rowsep":"1"}}]}]}}}}},"As the streak continues, a), b), and c) grow incrementally in lockstep while d) holds.

The same phenomenon applies to losses, only the names of the variables change.","In a knowledge system with weighted propositions, a record territory learning algorithm tracks the number of times a proposition is hit, then tracks the number of times it proves true as wins and the number of times it proves false as losses. Whenever the number of wins or losses for that proposition in a given processing session or volume (season) exceeds either a previously established threshold or a record, the algorithm adjusts the a-priori confidence value for the proposition. The formula for adjusting the confidence value takes into account the existing confidence value a) (represented by the standing record), the streak, wins and losses.","Positive and negative confidence values may be tracked separately by separate instances of the formula. The formula recognizes the system's maximum and minimum positive or negative confidence values. Consequently, the impact of a new record diminishes for propositions whose values are higher. The function implies mechanisms for permanently storing win\/loss data associated with each proposition.

If in the course of a plurality of subsequent input processing events, the attribute yields emergent candidates, the flag may be removed and the attribute may become a permanent part of the template.","Learning and Supervision","Confidence values that can be applied to a-priori weighting for knowledge molecules () are harder to infer from source text or elicit from an expert than structure (new knowledge molecules), thus we may seek structure in the acquired materials and translate them to confidence values only in the course of input processing and often with the supervision of human instructors.","Supervised learning has many different forms and strategies. Some strategies combine automated and manual processes.  illustrates the flow of process steps of such a strategy. A speaker of the language being processed may review the results of an interpretation process (). The results may be in the form of a paraphrase such as a verbose paraphrase, a clarifying question, a translation and\/or any process triggered as a result of the input. If the reviewer determines that the result is satisfactory and\/or correct (), the result is accepted and the next result may be reviewed (). If the reviewer determines that the result is not satisfactory and\/or correct (), automated processes may be used to adjust the parameters () associated with the formulas for processing inputs in the context structure and\/or structures most involved in the interpretation process.","Once the parameters have been adjusted, the interpreter may be automatically rerun () to reinterpret the same input using the new parameters. In this embodiment, adjustments to parameters in step  would be very small incremental adjustments. If the reviewer determines that the parameter adjustments have affected the results either positively or negatively, but not sufficiently to yield a satisfactory or correct result (), the reviewer may request that the system cyclically repeat steps  and  one or more times with incremental adjustments to determine if the adjustments in parameters improve the result.","If the reviewer determines that the result is not satisfactory and\/or correct (), the reviewer may stop the parameter adjustment process and proceed to the knowledge network adjustment process. Adjusting the knowledge network involves adding new knowledge molecules and\/or adjusting the a-priori weights of existing knowledge molecules. If the reviewer determines that new knowledge is required (), a process to permit manual or automated knowledge acquisition () may be initiated. If the reviewer determines that the existing knowledge is correct but its weight may need adjustment, manual and\/or automated processes to adjust the weighting may be initiated. One automated process may scan the knowledge network upward and\/or downward () to seek similar molecules (). The reviewer may conduct a manual review of the results of the scan (). If the reviewer determines that the initial scan failed to produce appropriately similar molecules, extended scans may be conducted (). If the reviewer determines that the initial scan successfully identified similar molecules, the molecules that originally produced the unsatisfactory and\/or incorrect result may be adjusted based on the similar molecules' weights ().","Initiative learning processes may use a linked review over the knowledge space to find new distributions or propositions. A similarity function may be used to infer such facts from existing knowledge.","New language learning may involve specialized processes including automated and manual learning strategies similar to the ones described in . An example of a new language learning process may be defined as shown in .","Given a lexicon for a new language and a knowledge network for English, the learning process may involve creating associations between the new lexicon and existing propositions, then replicating the English language propositions in the new language. For this to support high-quality translation, the knowledge network should remain intact without losing or changing existing proposition molecules, and it should not gain so many new molecules as to represent separate worlds. The challenge is to add new propositions to the knowledge network that are truly needed to work with the new language. Then the new propositions also should be associated with appropriate English words. If there are no English words that match closely enough, the preferred embodiment defines a strategy to create a new English idiom to use with the new propositional molecules. These are examples of the learning steps:","For each word in the new language's lexicon ( and ), display English synonyms and antonyms (). Then for each synonym and antonym (), determine which synonyms and antonyms apply () and get all existing propositions associated with each applicable English synonym and antonym (). From the set of associated propositions, manually select those propositions that apply to the new lexical entry (). As long as there are more applicable propositions to process (), the system translates atoms for that proposition () for validation. A person may manually review the translations of the atoms of the proposition (), and if the translations are correct (), proceeds to the next proposition (). If the system's attempt to translate the atoms are not all correct (), a person may manually identify incorrect atom translations and replace with correct translations (). This process is repeated for all propositions () for all synonyms and antonyms (). Once this is complete, the system may display the new language synonyms and antonyms, insure they are correct, reverse the process treating the new language as the source and English as the new language (). At the completion of that step, the changes to objects and knowledge molecules made may be permanently committed to the knowledge base ().",{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0303","num":"0392"},"figref":"FIG. 22","b":["2201","2202","2203"],"ul":{"@attributes":{"id":"ul0038","list-style":"none"},"li":{"@attributes":{"id":"ul0038-0001","num":"0000"},"ul":{"@attributes":{"id":"ul0039","list-style":"none"},"li":["A main processor () used to coordinate computational processes.","An additional processor () used to perform a specific set of functions such as language interpretation.","An additional processor () used to perform another specific set of functions such as speech-to-text conversion."]}}}},"The devices depicted in this illustration may be comprised of a single chip or a set of chips and\/or other electronic devices such as resistors and\/or capacitors, and\/or of any other machine configuration needed to process information in the ways described in the preferred embodiments and\/or claims.

This is because the voltages are so small and the network so large that there is no way the conscious mind can track the flow of impulses. This flow appears chaotic when examined with the most sensitive instruments currently in existence, but brain activity yields results because humans are able to recognize, generalize, infer, and make decisions, and even remember things that occur in the brain during subconscious states such as remembering a dream after awakening.","A phenomenon that helps resolve this chaos into choate thoughts is the \u201chot spot\u201d. A cluster of neurons becomes all fired up and triggers responses in the brain that constitute recognition, association, generalization, and resolve. The electrically excited cluster of neurons is the hot spot, and imaging techniques such as CAT scans and magnetic resonance imaging can graphically portray cognition distinguishing regions of the brain that are stimulated from other regions that are not. When a spot gets hot enough, the brain activity becomes noticeable by human consciousness. At that moment, there is a transition from underlying, seemingly chaotic, unconscious brain activity to meaningful, recognizable, conscious cognitive events. This transition characterizes emergence.","Though the exact mechanisms of consciousness in humans are still poorly understood, this invention seeks to imitate both the results and the behavior that leads to the results. By maintaining a contextual store of information upon which to base expectations, the multi-dimensional interpreter is continually prepared to wake up to a familiar reality and process inputs in that context.","Embodiments of the present invention utilizing this type of simulation, besides simulating the brain's ability to interpret complex spoken and written language, has mechanisms and methods of simulating consciousness. The features of consciousness this system may simulate include, but are not limited to, the following:","Perception\u2014By receiving and interpreting audio () and video signals (), correlating the information and providing a basis to act upon the perceived information, the knowledge appliance exhibits the conscious behavior of perception.","Cognition\u2014By interpreting incoming signals the knowledge appliance exhibits the conscious behavior of cognition.","Self-Awareness\u2014By possessing a set of attributes that describe a name and a set of functions the appliance is capable of performing, and another set of functions that other entities, including a user, are capable of performing, the appliance becomes aware of its capabilities in relation to other objects in the real-world.","Prediction\u2014By receiving, tracking and correlating information about the progress of time from a \u201csystem clock\u201d and about its own current location from a global positioning system or similar device, the appliance can predict when events are about to occur. Readily available information from calendars and mapping systems can make it possible for the device to track and perform reasoning processes about its position and\/or, by extension, its users position in space and time. thus","In a distributed knowledge system in which each fragment of knowledge can be considered a proposition, the truth, falsehood and applicability of a proposition can be determined during the course of processing real-world knowledge. Presuming that the domain or context of the knowledge proposition can be determined to match that of the real-world knowledge being processed, the weight of the proposition may be adjusted based on the determined truth, falsehood or applicability.
