title: Peak windowing for crest factor reduction
abstract: In order to reduce the crest factor of a signal for power amplification, a windowing function is applied. The windowing function that is applied is a triangular windowing function. The use of this function produces good results when those results are measured in terms of their effect on a transmitted signal in a WCDMA communications system. The filter for performing the triangular windowing function receives the signal, and applies it to a first delay element. The output from the first delay element is applied to a second delay element. An adder forms a weighted sum of the received signal and the signals at the outputs of the first delay element and the second delay element. A first accumulator is connected to receive an input from the adder and provides a first accumulator output, while a second accumulator is connected to receive an input from the first accumulator output and provides a second accumulator output.

No. 11\/109,536, filed Apr. 18, 2005 now U.S. Pat. No. 7,586,995, and entitled \u201cPEAK WINDOWING FOR CREST FACTOR REDUCTION\u201d, and is herein fully incorporated by reference for all purposes.","This invention relates to signal processing, and in particular to a method and a device for signal processing, before the signal is applied to a power amplifier.","In many communications systems, electronic signals are applied to a power amplifier before transmission. For example, in a base station of a cellular wireless communications system, electronic signals are applied to a power amplifier before being passed to an antenna for transmission over the air interface to the various subscribers.","Power amplifiers are designed such that they operate at maximum efficiency when their input signal levels are within a particular range.","In the case of a Wideband Code Division Multiple Access (WCDMA) or other Code Division Multiple Access (CDMA) system, data streams are multiplied with codes and added together. The composite signal is characterized by large variations in magnitude over time, which results in a large peak-to-average ratio (PAR). This reduces the efficiency of the power amplifiers to which these composite signals are applied before transmission, because the input signal levels are often outside the particular range within which the power amplifiers can operate with maximum efficiency. It is therefore highly desirable to reduce the PAR, without significantly degrading the transmitted signal.","The document \u201cEffect of Clipping in Wideband CDMA System and Simple Algorithm for Peak Windowing\u201d, O. V\u00e4\u00e4n\u00e4nen, J. Vankka and K. Halonen, World Wireless Congress, San Francisco, USA, May 28-31, 2002, pp. 614-619 describes a technique for reducing the PAR of a WCDMA signal. A windowing algorithm is applied to the signal, after upconversion to an intermediate frequency. More specifically, the document proposes the use of a windowing algorithm based on a Hamming function, which is a known mathematical function. The windowing algorithm is therefore known as a Hamming window.","However, the use of a Hamming window function requires the use of relatively large amounts of hardware to implement. This is a particular problem if a long window is used, although the use of a long window is advantageous from the point of view of improving the performance of the algorithm.","The possibility of an efficient implementation of the windowing function is particularly relevant when the device is to be implemented in a Field Programmable Gate Array (FPGA), when hardware resources are typically more limited than in a specifically designed integrated circuit, such as an ASIC.","In an embodiment of the invention, the windowing function that is applied is a triangular windowing function. It has surprisingly been found by the inventors that the use of this function produces good results when applied to a signal that is to be supplied to a power amplifier for amplification. In particular, the use of this function produces good results when those results are measured in terms of their effect on a transmitted signal in a WCDMA communications system.","In another embodiment of the invention, a filter performs a triangular windowing function on a received signal using only registers and adders\/subtractors. The filter receives the signal, and applies it to a first delay element. The output from the first delay element is applied to a second delay element. An adder forms a weighted sum of the received signal and the signals at the outputs of the first delay element and the second delay element. A first accumulator is connected to receive an input from the adder and provides a first accumulator output, while a second accumulator is connected to receive an input from the first accumulator output and provides a second accumulator output.","This filter, comprising registers, adders and subtractors, can be implemented particularly efficiently, especially in a FPGA. This means that the filter can be implemented conveniently and at low cost.",{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0020","num":"0019"},"figref":"FIG. 1"},"In this illustrated embodiment, the transmitter  forms part of a base station in a CDMA wireless communications system. As such, the downlink signal, sent from the transmitter , is made up of a relatively large number of individual signals combined together. In , the individual data signals are represented by the input lines , . . . , . These individual data signals are applied to respective modulators , . . . , , where, as will be well known to the person skilled in the art, they are multiplied by respective spreading codes. It will be appreciated that the operation of the modulators , . . . , is complex, but, for the purposes of understanding the present invention, it is sufficient to know that the outputs of the modulator are baseband signals, whose amplitudes vary with time.","The modulator outputs are then applied to a frequency upconversion block , which converts the baseband signal to a signal at the desired radio frequency. This radio frequency signal is then applied to a power amplifier , for amplification to a desired power level, and is then applied to an antenna  for transmission.","Unless special measures are taken, the radio frequency signal applied to the power amplifier  has a relatively high peak-to-average ratio (PAR), or crest factor. That is, the peaks in the signal level are considerably higher than the average level of the signal. A disadvantage of the relatively high peak-to-average ratio (PAR) of the signal is that the power amplifier  is designed to operate efficiently with input signal levels in a particular range. When the input signal level falls outside that range, the power amplifier  can no longer operate efficiently.","In order to mitigate this disadvantage, it is known to take action to reduce the peak levels in the modulator output signal. In this illustrated embodiment of the invention, the action that is taken is to apply a windowing function at an intermediate frequency.","Thus, within the frequency upconversion block , the baseband modulator output signals are applied to respective first upconverters , . . . , , which also receive signals at respective first intermediate frequencies IF, . . . , IF, and convert the baseband modulator output signals to the first intermediate frequency.","The signals at the first intermediate frequency are then combined, with the composite signal at the first intermediate frequency being applied to a windowing block , which applies a windowing function, as will be described in more detail below.","The output of the windowing block  is applied to a second upconverter , which also receives a signal at a second intermediate frequency IF, and converts the signal to the desired radio frequency for transmission.",{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0028","num":"0027"},"figref":["FIG. 2","FIG. 1"]},"Specifically, the signal  represents the sort of signal that would typically be obtained in a CDMA system, before any windowing function is applied. As can be seen in , the signal  reaches a peak value. However, to avoid inefficient operation of the power amplifier , it is preferred that the level of the signal should not exceed a level L.","One way to achieve this is to apply a clipping function to the signal  to produce a clipped signal . That is, the clipped signal  is exactly equal to the original signal , except that, when the original signal  exceeds the level L, the clipped signal  is restricted to the level . This has the disadvantage that the clipping adds sharp corners to the clipped signal , at the points where the clipping begins and ends. These sharp corners will result in frequency leakage into adjacent frequency bands.","In accordance with the preferred embodiment of the present invention, therefore, a windowing function is applied to the original signal .  shows the form of the windowed signal , and it can be seen that this avoids introducing the sharp corners into the signal.","Clipping can be described mathematically by the following equation:\n\n()=()\u00b7()\n\nin which x(n) is the original signal, y(n) is the clipped output signal, and c(n) is a clipping function, and where the clipping function is given by:\n",{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0033","num":"0032"},"maths":{"@attributes":{"id":"MATH-US-00001","num":"00001"},"math":{"@attributes":{"overflow":"scroll"},"mrow":{"mrow":[{"mi":"c","mo":"\u2061","mrow":{"mo":["(",")"],"mi":"n"}},{"mrow":{"mo":["{","\u2062","}"],"mtable":{"mtr":[{"mtd":{"mrow":{"mn":"1","mo":[",","\u2062"],"mstyle":{"mspace":{"@attributes":{"width":"3.6em","height":"3.6ex"}}},"mrow":{"mrow":{"mi":"if","mo":["\u2062","\u2062"],"mstyle":{"mspace":{"@attributes":{"width":"0.8em","height":"0.8ex"}}},"mrow":{"mo":["\uf603","\uf604"],"mrow":{"mi":"x","mo":"\u2061","mrow":{"mo":["(",")"],"mi":"n"}}}},"mo":"\u2264","mi":"A"}}}},{"mtd":{"mrow":{"mfrac":{"mi":"A","mrow":{"mo":["\uf603","\uf604"],"mrow":{"mi":"x","mo":"\u2061","mrow":{"mo":["(",")"],"mi":"n"}}}},"mo":[",","\u2062"],"mstyle":{"mspace":{"@attributes":{"width":"0.8em","height":"0.8ex"}}},"mrow":{"mrow":{"mi":"if","mo":["\u2062","\u2062"],"mstyle":{"mspace":{"@attributes":{"width":"0.8em","height":"0.8ex"}}},"mrow":{"mo":["\uf603","\uf604"],"mrow":{"mi":"x","mo":"\u2061","mrow":{"mo":["(",")"],"mi":"n"}}}},"mo":">","mi":"A"}}}}]},"mstyle":{"mspace":{"@attributes":{"width":"0.3em","height":"0.3ex"}}}},"mo":"."}],"mo":"="}}},"br":{}},"In the case of windowing, the clipping function c(n) is replaced with b(n).

That is, based on the current value x(n) of the input, a value for c(n) is calculated, determined by the relationship between x(n) and the clipping threshold A. From that, and based on the triangular window function described above, a value for b(n) is calculated, and hence a value for the output y(n) is calculated.","There is thus described a system which provides good performance in terms of its crest factor reduction, without excessively adversely affecting the other properties of the signal, while being easy to implement.","Although the invention has been described with particular reference to a CDMA wireless communications system, it could equally be applied to other wireless communications systems, such as OFDM systems. Further, although the invention has been described in terms of a wireless communication system, the crest factor of any signal can be reduced, if required, in a corresponding way."],"BRFSUM":[{},{}],"brief-description-of-drawings":[{},{}],"description-of-drawings":{"heading":"BRIEF DESCRIPTION OF THE DRAWINGS","p":[{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0013","num":"0012"},"figref":"FIG. 1"},{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0014","num":"0013"},"figref":"FIG. 2"},{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0015","num":"0014"},"figref":"FIG. 3"},{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0016","num":"0015"},"figref":"FIG. 4"},{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0017","num":"0016"},"figref":"FIG. 5"},{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0018","num":"0017"},"figref":["FIG. 6","FIG. 5"]},{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0019","num":"0018"},"figref":["FIG. 7","FIG. 3"]}]},"DETDESC":[{},{}]}
