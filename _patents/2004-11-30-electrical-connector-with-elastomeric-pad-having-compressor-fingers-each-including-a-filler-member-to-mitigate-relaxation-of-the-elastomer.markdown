title: Electrical connector with elastomeric pad having compressor fingers each including a filler member to mitigate relaxation of the elastomer
abstract: An electrical connector includes connector pads on a printed circuit board and contact members on an insulating substrate. The contact members are pressed against the contact pads by a compression mat having compressor fingers. A clamping arrangement forces the compressor fingers against the substrate and thereby presses the contact members against the contact pads. To counteract the inherent tendency of the compressor fingers to undergo stress relaxation after the compressor mat has been clamped, the connector also includes filler members disposed at least partially within the compressor fingers, essentially a “button-within-a-button” arrangement. Optionally, a filler deflection member may be interposed between the compression mat and a clamping plate of the clamping arrangement so that the filler deflection member abuts against the filler members. Alternatively, the filler members may be integral features of the deflection member.

No. 10\/929,474, filed Aug. 31, 2004, which is a divisional of U.S. patent application Ser. No. 10\/691,294 that has issued as U.S. Pat. No. 6,814,589, entitled \u201cELECTRICAL CONNECTOR WITH ELASTOMERIC ELEMENT AND RESTRAINER MEMBER TO OFFSET RELAXATION OF THE ELASTOMER\u201d, both of which are assigned to the assignee of the instant application.","1. Field of Invention","The present invention relates in general to the electrical connector field. More particularly, the present invention relates to an electrical connector of the type that uses a compression mat made out of elastomer material to press contact members against contact pads.","2. Background Art","Connectors are in widespread use in the electronics industry. One class of electrical connectors employs a first mechanical support that holds first contacts and a second mechanical support the holds second contacts. In use the first and second contacts are either pressed against one another or inserted one inside the other. One disadvantage of this class of connector is that at least one of the first and second mechanical supports must typically be mounted on a housing or other structure, and the contacts must be soldered to conductors.","In another class of connectors, printed circuit wiring extends to the edge of a printed circuit board. The edge of the printed circuit board is inserted into a fixture having contacts that engage the wiring.","In a further class of connectors, contact members on a ribbon cable are pressed against contact pads on a printed circuit board. Pressure is exerted on the back of the ribbon cable by a compression mat having compressor fingers that are aligned with the contact members and contact pads. The compression mat is clamped to the printed circuit board. The compression mat and its compressor fingers are made of elastomer materials, and the compressor fingers act somewhat as springs. When the clamping arrangement is tightened, the compressor fingers are placed under a state of compression and bulge outward, like small barrels. A connector of this type is disclosed in U.S. Pat. No. 6,607,120.","Connectors of this latter type have a drawback in that the elastomer material of the compression mat has the tendency to relax after the clamping arrangement has been tightened to a desired state. The compressor fingers bulge outward to assume a barrel-like shape. The relaxation of the material reduces the pressure forcing the contact members against the connector pads, and thus may lead to faulty connections due to decreasing actuation load with the passage of time.","One might consider adjusting the geometry or hardness of a compression mat in an attempt to minimize this stress relaxation. However, as the hardness of a compression mat increases, so does the actuation load that is required to compress the compressor fingers to the necessary degree. Furthermore, attempts might be made to shorten the compressor fingers in an attempt to minimize stress relaxation, but shorter compression fingers pose reliability concerns due to assembly tolerance stack (e.g., compressor fingers that are not quite long enough but are still within tolerance may not press the contact members against the contact pads with sufficient force to ensure a reliable connection).","Another problem with conventional compression mats is that the compressor fingers are prone to off-axis loading, so that one or more compressor fingers may skew to one side. This phenomenon, too, is detrimental to reliability.","The primary object of the present invention is to provide a connector which employs an elastomeric compression mat for pressing contact members against contact pads on a printed circuit board, but without the drawbacks discussed above with respect to the prior art.","A related object is to improve the reliability of a connector which employs a compression mat to force contact members against contact pads.","A further object is to provide filler members disposed at least partially within compressor fingers of a compression mat that reduce the tendency of the compressor fingers to relax after initial compression and which may also reduce skewing of the compressor fingers.","In accordance with one aspect of the invention, these and other objects that will become apparent in the ensuing detailed description can be attained by providing a connector that includes connector pads in a contact region on a printed circuit board and contact members that are disposed in a contact region on a first side of an insulating substrate. The contact region of the substrate is aligned with the contact region of the printed circuit board. The connector also includes a compression mat having compressor fingers that contact a second side of the substrate in alignment with the contact members on the first side, and a clamping arrangement to press the compression mat toward the printed circuit board. In order to counteract the inherent tendency of the compressor fingers to undergo stress relaxation after the compressor mat has been clamped, the connector also includes a plurality of filler members, with each filler member being disposed at least partially within one of the compressor fingers. This is referred to herein as a \u201cbutton-within-a-button\u201d arrangement. Optionally, a filler deflection member that abuts an end surface of the filler members may be interposed between the compression mat and a clamping plate of clamping arrangement. Alternatively, the filler members may be integral features of the deflection member. The filler deflection member may be used, for example, if additional compressive forces are needed to establish a positive and reliable connection between the contact members and the contact pads.","In accordance with another aspect of the invention, a compression mat having compression fingers is used in conjunction with filler members in a method for electrically connecting pads that are disposed within a contact region on a printed circuit board to contact members that are disposed within a contact region on a first side on an insulating substrate. The method includes the step providing each of the compressor fingers with a filler member extending at least partially into the compressor finger. The method also includes the step of placing the contact region of the substrate in a face-to-face relationship with the contact region of the printed circuit board and the step of positioning the compressor mat adjacent to a second side of the substrate, with the compressor fingers being aligned with the contact members on the first side of the substrate. Finally, the method includes the step of pressing the compression mat toward the printed circuit board. Optionally, the method may include the additional step of interposing a filler deflection member between the compression mat and a clamping plate of a clamping arrangement that secures the substrate, the compression mat, and the filler deflection member to the printed circuit board. In this optional embodiment, the filler deflection member abuts an end surface of the filler members. Alternatively, the filler members may be integral features of the deflection member.","The present invention is directed to an improved connector that can be used, for example, to connect a ribbon cable to contact pads on an integrated circuit board. The use of the present invention to connect ribbon cables is exemplary and not limiting. Those skilled in the art will appreciate that a connector in accordance with the present invention may be used in other applications.  illustrates a first printed circuit board  having circuitry such as integrated circuits  and a second printed circuit board  having circuitry such as integrated circuits .

This exerts a compressive force on the compressor fingers , which act somewhat as springs. However, the compression mat  and its compressor fingers  are made of a rubbery, elastomeric material such as thermal silicone rubber. As discussed in the \u201cBackground of the Invention\u201d section of this document, the elastomeric material has a tendency to relax over a period of time after it has been placed in a state of compression. The result is that the pressure forcing the contact members  against the contact pads  would ordinarily be reduced after the clamping assembly  is originally tightened. In order to reduce the tendency of the elastomeric material to relax, the connector  also includes filler members . Filler members  are made of a material having a stiffness, or durometer measurement, which is smaller or larger than that of the elastomeric material of the compression mat  and its compressor fingers . Each filler member  is disposed at least partially within one of the compressor fingers , essentially in a \u201cbutton-within-a-button\u201d arrangement.","The purpose of the clamping assembly  is to force the compression mat  toward the printed circuit board . It will be apparent that there are many possible ways to achieve this purpose and that the clamping assembly  may take many forms. In the form shown in , the clamping assembly  includes a clamping member  having two alignment holes  for passage of threaded metal bolts . The clamping member  is constructed of stainless steel or other suitable metal. The clamping assembly  also includes clamping plate  having two threaded holes  for receiving the threads of bolt . The clamping plate  is constructed of stainless steel or other suitable metal.","During assembly, the bolts  pass through the alignment holes  of clamping member , the alignment holes  (shown in ) of the printed circuit board , the alignment holes  (shown in ) of the ribbon cable , the alignment holes  (shown in ) of compression mat , and the threaded holes  of clamping plate . The bolts  are then tightened to compress the compression fingers  so as to force the contact members  tightly against the contact pads .","As mentioned above, the clamping assembly  may take many forms. In a modification of clamping assembly  shown in , ribbon cable  and compression mat  may be aligned by features on clamping plate  and\/or a frame member. In this modification, which is discussed in detail below with reference to , alignment pins of clamping plate  and alignment posts of the frame member are used to align the ribbon cable  and the compression mat  in lieu of bolts  passing through the alignment holes  of ribbon cable  and the alignment holes  of compression mat .","The compression mat  may be made by compression molding, from (for example) thermal silicone rubber or other silicone-based material. Other suitable materials for compression mat  include polyurethane, flexibilized epoxies, and thermal elastomers. Preferably, compression mat  is compression molded with removable inserts present at selected locations in the compression mold. The inserts will subsequently be removed from compression mat  and replaced with filler members . Each insert is positioned in the compression mold so that it extends into an area of the mold that defines one of the compressor fingers . The silicone-based material (preferably, a precursor material in a liquid state) is injected around the inserts into the compression mold. Preferably, prior to injecting the silicone-based material into the compression mold, the inserts are coated with a conventional silicone mold release to aid in the subsequent removal of the inserts from the compression mat . Also, removal of the inserts may be aided by appropriate selection of the material from which the inserts are made. For example, the inserts may be made of stainless steel. The silicone-based material is then cured to form the compression mat  and its compressor fingers . After the compression mat  has cured, the inserts are removed from the compression mat  to form recesses. Then, the recesses are back-filled with (for example) a flexible epoxy adhesive (preferably, a precursor material in a liquid state) that is cured to form filler members . Other suitable materials for filler members  include thermal silicone rubber or other silicone-based materials, polyurethane, epoxies, acrylics, and thermal elastomers. Alternatively, the filler members  may be pre-formed and then placed into the recesses.","The inserts may be a part of the compression mold, or may be separate from the compression mold. In the former case, the inserts may extend directly from the mold face. In the latter case, the inserts may extend (in unitary fashion) from a mold attachment plate placed on the mold face, or may be individually placed on the mold face.","In another alternative, the recesses may be cut into the compression mat . For example, the recesses may be cut into a commercially available compression mat using a laser. Compression mats with compression fingers are commercially available from (for example) InterCon Systems, Inc., of Harrisburg, Pa. as part of their C-BYTE\u2122 connector system. In still another alternative, the compression mat  may be compression molded with filler members  pre-formed and present in the compression mold.","The filler members  are made of a material harder or softer than that of compression pad  and its compressor fingers  to achieve the desired effect, e.g., mitigating stress relaxation and\/or skewing. Additionally, the dimensions, i.e., height and width, of the filler members  can be varied to achieve the desired effect. The normal force required to compress the compression pad  and its compressor fingers  to the nominal deflection can be adjusted, as well as the degree to which stress relaxation and\/or skewing occurs. It is typically desirable to compress the compression mat  and its compressor fingers between about 16\u201331 mils (24 nominal) to achieve the required contact force between contact members  and contact pads . However, those skilled in the art will appreciate that the magnitude of the desired compression is a function of the compression mat geometry and stiffness. Consequently, the desired deflection may be stated as a percentage of button height. The greater the compression of compression mat , the greater the stress relaxation.","Referring now to , the filler members  preferably have a height (denoted as \u201ch\u201d in ) extending into the compressor fingers  about equal to one half of the height (denoted as \u201cH\u201d in ) of compressor fingers . Similarly, the filler members  preferably have a width (denoted as \u201cw\u201d in ) about equal to one half of the width (denoted as \u201cW\u201d in ) of compressor fingers . However, the height and width ratios may be varied to achieve the desired effect. Those skilled in the art will appreciate that the spirit and scope of the invention are not limited to the preferred height and width ratios.",{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0040","num":"0039"},"figref":"FIG. 6","b":["60","20","62","64","64","40","64","66","20","64","60","20","40","62","64","31","52","66","54","52","66","20","40","42","52"]},{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0041","num":"0040"},"figref":"FIG. 7","b":["70","20","40","46","70","46","70","46","70","70","70","70","46","44","70","32","31","26","10"]},{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0042","num":"0041"},"figref":["FIG. 8","FIG. 9","FIG. 8","FIG. 9"]},{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0043","num":"0042"},"tables":{"@attributes":{"id":"TABLE-US-00001","num":"00001"},"table":{"@attributes":{"frame":"none","colsep":"0","rowsep":"0"},"tgroup":[{"@attributes":{"align":"left","colsep":"0","rowsep":"0","cols":"4"},"colspec":[{"@attributes":{"colname":"1","colwidth":"70pt","align":"left"}},{"@attributes":{"colname":"2","colwidth":"56pt","align":"center"}},{"@attributes":{"colname":"3","colwidth":"35pt","align":"center"}},{"@attributes":{"colname":"4","colwidth":"56pt","align":"center"}}],"thead":{"row":[{"entry":{"@attributes":{"namest":"1","nameend":"4","align":"center","rowsep":"1"}}},{"entry":[{},{},"Deflection",{}]},{"entry":["Fill Material","Shore A Hardness","Force (lbs)","Relaxation %"]},{"entry":{"@attributes":{"namest":"1","nameend":"4","align":"center","rowsep":"1"}}}]},"tbody":{"@attributes":{"valign":"top"},"row":{"entry":{}}}},{"@attributes":{"align":"left","colsep":"0","rowsep":"0","cols":"4"},"colspec":[{"@attributes":{"colname":"1","colwidth":"70pt","align":"left"}},{"@attributes":{"colname":"2","colwidth":"56pt","align":"char","char":"."}},{"@attributes":{"colname":"3","colwidth":"35pt","align":"char","char":"."}},{"@attributes":{"colname":"4","colwidth":"56pt","align":"char","char":"."}}],"tbody":{"@attributes":{"valign":"top"},"row":[{"entry":["Dow Corning RTV627","64","104.0","10.1"]},{"entry":["3M DP460",">100","227.7","50.7"]},{"entry":["3M DP100","88","238.0","36.8"]},{"entry":["3M DP105","44","86.4","8.8"]},{"entry":{"@attributes":{"namest":"1","nameend":"4","align":"center","rowsep":"1"}}}]}}]}}},"When the filler members were made of a material that is harder than the compression mat and its compressor fingers, the deflection force drastically increases.
