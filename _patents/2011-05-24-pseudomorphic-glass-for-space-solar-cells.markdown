{"@attributes":{"id":"description"},"GOVINT":[{},{}],"heading":["STATEMENT OF GOVERNMENT INTEREST","BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION","SUMMARY","DESCRIPTION OF THE PREFERRED EMBODIMENT"],"p":["The conditions under which this invention was made are such as to entitle the Government of the United States under paragraph 1(a) of Executive Order 10096, as represented by the Secretary of the Air Force, to the entire right, title and interest therein, including foreign rights.","The invention relates generally to coverglass materials for spacecraft solar arrays and, in particular to a new coverglass material that provides high UV spectral transmissivity in a robust, flexible, and fully encapsulating format.","Traditional space solar arrays generally consist of solar cells bonded to rigid panel substrates and covered with ceria-doped borosilicate microsheets of glass. The rigid panels below and glass sheet above provide protection for the sensitive photovoltaic cells from the ultraviolet light, atomic oxygen and radiation e.g., protons and electrons, present in the space environment. Although coverglass materials have worked satisfactorily for existing solar cell technologies, their cost, fragility, and lack of complete encapsulation (the metal cell to cell interconnects are not covered by the coverglass) have led many organizations to search for a simpler alternative. In addition, space solar cell developers have indicated that advanced solar cells will require access to a wider spectral range than current coverglass materials provide. These efforts have primarily focused on either silicones or polyimide materials which could be applied in a variety of methods. To date, none have been developed which have the needed spectral transmissivity and environmental stability for the space environment.","A new solar cell design, called inverted metamorphic multijunction (IMM), has been recently developed that offers higher efficiency, plus the potential for significantly lower mass and flexibility. For an IMM cell, 10-15 microns of active semiconductor photovoltaic material are removed from the growth substrate resulting in an extremely efficient solar cell (>32% AM0) which is very light and incredibly fragile. Incorporating this new device into the standard rigid panel substrate and coverglass design negates the mass and flexibility opportunities available with the IMM. Thus, there is an even greater need to find coverglass replacement materials suitable for developing a low mass, environmentally stable, and flexible solar array blanket.","For thin, flexible blankets, environmental protection is required on both sides of the photovoltaic cell in order to shield it from the space environment. Kapton, a polyimide film developed by DuPont, is generally viewed as a reasonable option for a flexible substrate, as it has been used previously and is compatible with the space environment. In order to obtain sufficient thickness for radiation protection, about 8 mils of Kapton would be required to equal the shielding protection of 5 mils of coverglass. Kapton has a coefficient of thermal expansion which is roughly ten times greater than that of the IMM device. Thick Kapton films, such as this, may cause the fragile IMM device to fail under the extreme thermal cycling expected on orbit (<\u2212100\u00b0 C. to >+100\u00b0 C.) due to the differences in the coefficient of thermal expansion.","Thus there is a need for a protective, flexible, environmentally stable coverglass replacement for both conventional solar arrays as well as for flexible solar arrays, a coverglass material that can be used with recently developed IMM cells to provide a tremendous increase in mass specific power and volumetric power density.","Pseudomorphic Glass (PMG) consists of spheres-like beads of coverglass material, typically fused silica or ceria-doped borosilicate glasses of 20-40 microns diameter, embedded in a matrix of conventional coverglass adhesives. In this hybrid configuration, the matrix provides the mechanical integrity and the glass spheres provide the optical characteristics. PMG may replace convention coverglass for rigid solar panels or the beads may be combined with Kapton to protect the underside of the solar panels thus forming a flexible solar panel. PMG can be manufactured as microsheets that adhere to the solar cells or may be sprayed onto the cells. PMG has a greater transmission bandwidth than conventional coverglass materials required for new solar cell designs. The thickness of the PMG coating can be readily tailored to the shielding requirements of a particular mission. A multi-layer hybrid PMG coverglass using a thin top layer of ceria-doped borosilicate beads and a bottom layer of fused silica beads yields enhanced UV protection and a broadened spectral transmission bandwidth.","PseudoMorphic Glass (PMG) uses conventional solar array materials (coverglasses and adhesives) but in a novel hybrid format that leverages the favorable properties of each. PMG consists of small diameter spheres of traditional coverglass materials, such as ceria-doped borosilicate glass and\/or fused silica, imbedded in a matrix of either coverglass adhesives, such as DC93-500, a clear silicon adhesive by Dow Corning, or substrate replacement materials, such as Kapton. In this hybrid configuration, the matrix provides the mechanical integrity, and the glass spheres provide the primary radiation shielding.  shows a cross-section of a flexible solar panel blanket design incorporating PMG coverglass on the top as well as PMG for the substrate. In addition, PMG could be incorporated in conventional rigid panel designs, as shown in , wherein the PMG replaces the conventional coverglass.",{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0025","num":"0024"},"figref":["FIG. 3A","FIG. 3B"]},{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0026","num":"0025"},"figref":["FIG. 4","FIG. 4"]},"A variety of coverglass adhesives from Dow-Corning and NuSil in combination with ceria-doped borosilicate and fused silica spheres were investigated (see ). Efforts were made to maximize the bead loading in order to maximize the radiation stopping power per unit of PMG thickness. Due to the differing mechanical shape of the fused silica and borosilicate glass, the maximum bead content we were able to reproducibly form using the doctor blade technique was significantly different, 0.9:1 (bead to adhesive ratio by mass) for fused silica and 1.8:1 for borosilicate glass. We also investigated the effect of bead density on overall optical transmission. Those tests demonstrated that reducing the bead density by 50% only increased the overall transmission by \u02dc1-2%. This result is understandable given that not all optical scattering events are necessarily harmful. A significant fraction of these are backscatter events, thus incident light that is reflected from a bead\/adhesive interface has a significant probability of being reflected back toward the solar cell through another reflection event.",{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0028","num":"0027"},"figref":"FIG. 6"},"Samples of PMG were bonded to various solar cells to determine the impact of PMG transmission on overall performance.  is a photograph of a Spectrolab ITJ triple junction solar cell covered with a 5 mil fused silica PMG film. The PMG material appears opaque due to a significant amount of total internal reflection when free standing. This loss mechanism is largely eliminated once the film is bonded to a high index solar cell. Notice the clarity with which the grid fingers can be seen on the PMG coated solar cell in .",{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0030","num":"0029"},"figref":["FIGS. 8A and 8B","FIG. 6","FIG. 8A","FIG. 8B"]},"Investigation into the environmental stability and protective nature of PMG was initiated. Of initial concern was the ability of the PMG film to withstand UV radiation. Bare samples of PMG adhesives were subjected to 1000 equivalent sun hours of external UV testing.  shows the percent change in spectral absorption for pure adhesive samples only. This testing demonstrated that DC93-500 (DC9) and SCV1-2590 (SCV1) were the most stable and were relatively equivalent.","PMG films tested under the same conditions (1000 sun equivalent hours) demonstrate the positive aspects of ceria doping of the bead material.  shows the percent change in absorption for bare adhesive as well as fused silica PMG films with two concentrations of beads (0.9:1 and 0.45:1). A calculation was made to estimate the PMG film performance based on the behavior of the adhesive assuming a simple volumetric displacement model, i.e., replacing UV sensitive adhesive with insensitive beads. The general agreement between the predicted behavior (dashed lines) and measured PMG materials (solid lines) suggests that inherent UV durability in fused silica PMG is limited by the amount of adhesive that can be replace with fused silica beads.",{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0033","num":"0032"},"figref":"FIG. 11"},"Initial testing of bare PMG as well as PMG coated solar cells subjected to electron and proton irradiation was undertaken.  shows the remaining factor for GaAs solar cells coated with ceria-doped borosilicate PMG (CDB PMG), fused silica PMG (FS PMG), conventional coverglass and a bare cell subjected to a 2\u00d710\/cm1-MeV electron fluence, where Voc is the open circuit voltage, Jsc is the short circuit current, and FF is the fill factor. Overall, the fused silica PMG compares well with conventional coverglass, with ceria-doped borosilicate PMG slightly lower in performance. A similar test was conducted on bare PMG samples subjected to a 1\u00d710\/cm1-MeV electron fluence. Optical characterization of the PMG samples showed no change in properties (no increase in absorption, reflection, etc), thus it is unclear as to why this ceria PMG sample showed lower performance. It is likely due to GaAs cell to cell variations as this data is for single samples.","A similar set of GaAs cells was subjected to 50 keV proton irradiation. At this energy, the protons are completely absorbed in the PMG\/coverglass layer, thus one would expect that the underlying GaAs cell would not experience any damage.  shows the remaining factor for proton fluences of 4\u00d710\/cmand 4\u00d710\/cm. As expected, the bare GaAs devices experienced significant damage (Jsc and Efficiency were completely degraded for 4\u00d710\/cm). The PMG films behaved like coverglass up to 4\u00d710\/cmfluence. As the fluence increased, the PMG films demonstrated a slight amount of Jsc loss. Optical micrographs suggest that the loss in Jsc is likely due to an increase in reflectance. These reflectance losses appear to be coming from cracks in the PMG, likely caused by mechanical degradation of the PMG adhesive (adhesive material cross-linking).","PMG applied to a flexible blanket design solar panels offers coverglass heritage performance in a format that enables improved manufacturing, flexibility and performance. The PMG thickness can be tailored for the shielding requirements of the particular mission\/orbit and not for ground handling yield issues. Conformal anti-reflection coatings and electrostatic discharge (ESD) coatings could be deposited on the entire coated blanket. The ability to conformally coat current rigid solar arrays for improved electrostatic discharge (ESD) protection is an additional benefit. Last year, 10% of new geostationary (GEO) spacecraft suffered electrical power system degradation\/failures, with the vast majority of them being solar cell string losses.","New solar cell technologies require optical cover systems (coverglass, coatings, adhesives) that transmit photons from 300 nm to >1500 nm. Current coverglass chemistries are unable to meet this transmission bandwidth. The development of new coverglass technologies is being limited by the need to be able to form microsheets of the new material. The use of PMG eliminates this manufacturing limitation. The PMG material may offer improved off normal light capture characteristics compared to conventional planar coverglass technology. This is particularly of interest for solar arrays with less than 2-axis tracking and may represent an improvement in orbital energy capture.","The PMG approach allows the glass spheres to provide the bulk of radiation protection while keeping the volume of binder matrix material limited. Limited binder volume means reduced potential for optical degradation from environmental challenges. The PMG material can be applied to the array panel following cell laydown, potentially using a spray-on process for reduced costs and increased yields since many cells are rejected due to cracked coverglass.","Controlling the coefficient of thermal expansion (CTE) mismatch is and will continue to be an important issue for space solar arrays. The CTE of PMG materials can be altered by varying both the ratio of beads and adhesives as well as by altering the choice of bead and\/or adhesive materials. Such an approach may reduce the difference in CTE mismatch between the PMG and the photovoltaic device."],"BRFSUM":[{},{}],"brief-description-of-drawings":[{},{}],"description-of-drawings":{"heading":"BRIEF DESCRIPTION OF THE DRAWINGS","p":[{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0009","num":"0008"},"figref":"FIG. 1"},{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0010","num":"0009"},"figref":"FIG. 2"},{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0011","num":"0010"},"figref":"FIG. 3A"},{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0012","num":"0011"},"figref":"FIG. 3B"},{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0013","num":"0012"},"figref":"FIG. 4"},{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0014","num":"0013"},"figref":"FIG. 5"},{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0015","num":"0014"},"figref":"FIG. 6"},{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0016","num":"0015"},"figref":"FIG. 7"},{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0017","num":"0016"},"figref":"FIG. 8A"},{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0018","num":"0017"},"figref":"FIG. 8B"},{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0019","num":"0018"},"figref":"FIG. 9"},{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0020","num":"0019"},"figref":"FIG. 10"},{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0021","num":"0020"},"figref":"FIG. 11"},{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0022","num":"0021"},"figref":"FIG. 12","sup":["15","2 "]},{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0023","num":"0022"},"figref":"FIG. 13","sup":["14","2 ","15","2 "]}]},"DETDESC":[{},{}]}
