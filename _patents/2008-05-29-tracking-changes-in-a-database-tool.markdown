All Rights Reserved.","The present application relates generally to the technical field of algorithms and programming and, in one specific example, the display of data in a database.","Structured data resources (e.g., databases and spreadsheets) are widely used to store, manage and process data that is susceptible to such structure and organization. A database, as an example of structured data, may be used by many individuals (e.g., knowledge workers) who are not database administrators. These knowledge workers may make changes to the database in terms of changing the data in a table of the database or changing the arrangement of a schema associated with various database tables. Over time, these changes may be made by a number of individuals. Further, many of these changes may be collaborative in nature.","In the following description, for purposes of explanation, numerous specific details are set forth to provide a thorough understanding of an example embodiment. It may be evident, however, to one skilled in the art that the present invention will be practiced without these specific details.","In some example embodiments, a system and method is illustrated for tracking changes or edits to a structured data resource (e.g., a table, schema, or document). A table may be visually represented as a grid, and may be referred to herein as a list. Example changes or edits may include the editing of record data, the changing of data (e.g., the addition or deletion of a record) within a row or column, the editing of a data style (e.g., the use of bold, italics, strike though) for a row or column, the adding or deletion of rows or columns, the changing of data types, the editing of relationships between tables in a schema, the editing of functions (e.g., mathematical formula, expressions, or equations) used to process the data included in a table or tables, the creation of new tables, the editing of privileges associated editing a table or schema, or some other suitable change. These edits may be made by one or more users acting collaboratively to edit a table. Edits or changes may be reflected in edit data. Associated with the edit data may be identity information identifying the user making an edit and the time and date of the edit. This edit data may be displayed later as an edit history (e.g., edit history data) associated with a particular database table or schema. This edit history may reflect edits over time. In some example cases, the table may be thought of as a list.","In some example embodiments, edit data may be recorded on a session basis and ultimately stored into a log file. This log file may be a text file (e.g., .txt formatted file) including Unicode or American Standard Code for Information Interchange (ASCII) based characters. Further, this log file may be stored into persistent or non-persistent memory. This log file may be retrieved as an edit history. A session may include a Transmission Control Protocol\/Internet Protocol (TCP\/IP) based session, a user activity based session, a temporal based session, or some other suitable basis for a session. User activity may include for example the user using some type of input device (e.g., a mouse, light pen, keyboard or other suitable input device) to interact with one or more devices and via a GUI. This input device may act as a selection device. The edit data may be recorded into the log file may record for a particular session. The log file may then be stored into a user edit history database.","In some example embodiments, a screen object or widget may be used to display this edit history. A display element (e.g., a screen object or widget) may be an element of a GUI that displays an information arrangement changeable by the user. A screen object or widget may include a graphical pointer, tooltip, a drop down menu, or other suitable screen object or widget. The screen objects or widget may be implemented via a browser-based client engine such as is used with FLASH\u2122, Asynchronous JavaScript and XML (AJAX), ACTIVE X\u2122, or Java. Additionally, screen objects or widgets may be components as may appear on a Visual Basic (VB) form, a C# form, or via a Java or C\/C++ implementation. In one example embodiment, a graphical pointer (e.g., a mouse pointer) may be used in combination with another screen object or widget to display the edit history. For example, an edit history may be displayed where an input command is provided to execute a function associated with the mouse pointer and\/or screen object or widget. This function may be a mouse-over function, a focus function, right-click function, left-click function, keyboard function, or other suitable. A focus function (e.g., focus) may be a function that facilitates an indication that a GUI screen object or widget is currently selected to receive input. In some example embodiments, focus includes a function that may be implemented which utilizes a Focus Follows Mouse (e.g., FFM) policy, where the focus automatically follows the current placement of the mouse pointer.","In some example embodiments, the input command may be provided with respect to a portion of a table or schema so as to retrieve and display the edit history with respect to that portion. For example, an edit history may be displayed via the screen object or widget with respect to a particular table, row, column, or schema. This edit history may be displayed via the screen object or widget being proximate to the particular table, row, column, function or schema. Proximate may include a measure of pixels between the screen object or widget and the particular table, row, column, or schema as displayed with a GUI. This measure may be within, for example, 0-100 pixels. Further, a screen object or widget may be used to turn off or on the display of the edit history, of the tracking of the edit history. Other suitable information, in addition to identifying information, may be displayed in the edit history.","In some example embodiments, the system and method shown herein may be implemented in real time. For example, in cases where an edit occurs to a table or schema this change may be reflected in real time and may be visible to a plurality of users. Further, through the use of, for example, Application Programming Interfaces (API) such as Open Database Connectivity (ODBC) the system and method illustrated herein may be platform independent such that it may be implemented with a plurality of database products (see database products outlined below).","Example System",{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0033","num":"0032"},"figref":"FIG. 1","b":["100","101","102","108","101","102","103","104","105","106","102","102","107","107","101","107","102","108","108","108","101","108","101","108","108","109","110"]},"In some example embodiments, operatively connected to this database server  is a table data database  and\/or a user edit history database .

These components, and the functionality associated with each, may be used by client, server, or peer computer systems. These various components can be implemented into the system on an as-needed basis. These components may be written in an object-oriented computer language such that a component oriented or object-oriented programming technique can be implemented using a Visual Component Library (VCL), Component Library for Cross Platform (CLX), Java Beans (JB), Enterprise Java Beans (EJB), Component Object Model (COM), or Distributed Component Object Model (DCOM)), or other suitable technique. These components are linked to other components via various Application Programming Interfaces (APIs) and then compiled into one complete server and\/or client application. The method for using components in the building of client and server applications is well known in the art. Further, these components may be linked together via various distributed programming protocols as distributed computing components.","Distributed Computing Components and Protocols","Some example embodiments may include remote procedure calls being used to implement one or more of the above-illustrated components across a distributed programming environment. For example, a logic level may reside on a first computer system that is located remotely from a second computer system including an interface level (e.g., a GUI). These first and second computer systems can be configured in a server-client, peer-to-peer, or some other configuration. The various levels can be written using the above-illustrated component design principles and can be written in the same programming language or in different programming languages. Various protocols may be implemented to enable these various levels and the components included therein to communicate regardless of the programming language used to write these components. For example, an operation written in C++ using Common Object Request Broker Architecture (CORBA) or Simple Object Access Protocol (SOAP) can communicate with another remote module written in Java\u2122. Suitable protocols include SOAP, CORBA, and other protocols well-known in the art.","A System of Transmission between a Server and Client","Some embodiments may use the Open Systems Interconnection (OSI) model or Transmission Control Protocol\/Internet Protocol (TCP\/IP) protocol stack model for defining the protocols used by a network to transmit data. In applying these models, a system of data transmission between a server and client, or between peer computer systems, is illustrated as a series of roughly five layers comprising: an application layer, a transport layer, a network layer, a data link layer, and a physical layer. In the case of software having a three-tier architecture, the various tiers (e.g., the interface, logic, and storage tiers) reside on the application layer of the TCP\/IP protocol stack. In an example implementation using the TCP\/IP protocol stack model, data from an application residing at the application layer is loaded into the data load field of a TCP segment residing at the transport layer. This TCP segment also includes port information for a recipient software application residing remotely. This TCP segment is loaded into the data load field of an IP datagram residing at the network layer. Next, this IP datagram is loaded into a frame residing at the data link layer. This frame is then encoded at the physical layer and the data transmitted over a network such as the Internet, a LAN, a WAN, or some other suitable network. In some cases, Internet refers to a network of networks. These networks may use a variety of protocols for the exchange of data, including the aforementioned TCP\/IP, or some other suitable protocol. These networks may be organized within a variety of topologies (e.g., a star topology) or structures.","A Computer System",{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0065","num":"0064"},"figref":"FIG. 21","b":"2100"},"The example computer system  includes a processor  (e.g., a CPU, a Graphics Processing Unit (GPU) or both), a main memory , and a static memory , which communicate with each other via a bus .
