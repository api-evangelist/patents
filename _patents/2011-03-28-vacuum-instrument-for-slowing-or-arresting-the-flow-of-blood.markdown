{"@attributes":{"id":"description"},"RELAPP":[{},{}],"heading":["PRIORITY CLAIM","FIELD OF THE INVENTION","BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION","SUMMARY OF THE INVENTION","DETAILED DESCRIPTION OF THE PREFERRED EMBODIMENTS"],"p":["This application is a continuation of application Ser. No. 10\/677,848 filed Oct. 2, 2003, entitled \u201cVACUUM INSTRUMENT FOR SLOWING OR ARRESTING THE FLOW OF BLOOD\u201d which issued as U.S. Pat. No. 7,935,094, which is a continuation of application Ser. No. 09\/489,632, filed Jan. 24, 2000 entitled \u201cSURGICAL VACUUM INSTRUMENT FOR RETRACTING, EXTRACTING, AND MANIPULATING TISSUE\u201d, which issued as U.S. Pat. No. 6,641,575, which claims priority to Provisional Application No. 60\/117,300, filed Jan. 26, 1999 entitled \u201cVACUUM-SUCTION SURGICAL RETRACTOR, EXTRACTOR, AND MANIPULATOR\u201d.","The present invention relates generally to the field of surgery. More specifically, the present invention relates to a vacuum device that can be positioned over a wound or laceration site to slow or completely stop bleeding.","The quality and efficient progress of a surgical case depends on adequate visualization of the internal organs. A surgeon will typically use retraction devices to move certain organs or hold them in place so that another structure, organ, or pathologic entity can be visualized adequately to facilitate surgery on the structure. The most common devices used for retraction involve metal retractors which have been produced in various shapes and sizes to provide atraumatic manipulation of delicate living tissues. Such sharp or rigid clamp devices, such as forceps, are often coupled to organs and traction applied to move the organ away from the surgical site to expose the surgical area in question. Occasionally the organs are retracted so that adhesions attached to those organs are stretched or placed under tension and can be more easily lysed, cut or dissected. For example, adhesions which connect the fallopian tubes, ovaries and uterus can be better visualized if the uterus is retracted exposing the adhesions so that surgical lysis with a sharp tool or laser dissection can progress more accurately and swiftly.","Complications may result from the use of conventional clamping devices of the prior art. Clamping devices frequently traumatize and damage the tissue or organs to which they are clamped. These complications may be compounded in laparoscopic surgery due to the limited visibility and space constraints commiserate with such surgery.","Laparoscopy involves small incisions (typically on the order of 5 to 12 mm, and up to 20 mm) in the abdomen or pelvis through which instruments or probes are placed for dissection, manipulation, extraction, and other operative techniques. Due in particular to this limited accessibility, there is a need for atraumatic retraction devices that can apply a high degree of leverage and forcefully retract, extract, or manipulate certain intra-cavity structures or organs to facilitate dissection or enhance visualization of adjacent structures.","Suction cups of various shapes and sizes have been used in the field of obstetrics to assist in the vaginal and operative delivery of newborns for over thirty years. Current state of the art involves the suction cup that is applied to the fetal scalp during the second stage (pushing through the birth canal) of labor. The obstetrician applies traction to the infant's head via a \u201cstring,\u201d \u201cwand\u201d or \u201cflexible or rigid shaft with a handle\u201d coupled to the suction cup. The traction is applied in an outward fashion while the delivering mother pushes, thereby assisting in the delivery of the newborn. These suction cups are typically made of silicone, rubber, vinyl or other plastic, or combinations of plastic and rubber. Suction is generally applied through suction tubing which is coupled to a nipple on the vacuum cup, the nipple communicating with the interior of the cup. The method by which the suction is produced can vary from large stationary mechanical vacuum\/suction devices to hand-held pumps similar to that which are used to bleed brake fluid from brake lines of automobiles.","It has been proposed to similarly utilize suction devices to manipulate tissue during surgery. Such proposals have generally fallen short of expectations, and have exhibited various disadvantages. For example, U.S. patent to Bilweis discloses an endoscopic surgical instrument which includes a tube with a suction cup at one end and a bulb at its opposite end. The cup is placed on a target tissue and the bulb is compressed and released in order to apply a suction to the tissue. The tissue is released by again compressing the bulb. The Bilweis device, however is difficult to utilize in that the surgeon has very little control over the level of vacuum applied to the tissue, and no means by which to determine the level that is applied. Further, releasing the tissue may be difficult or impossible in that the vacuum may not be completely released upon complete compression of the bulb. Moreover, manipulation of the tissue is limited by the direct application of force along the tube, either by movement of the tube or by movement of a trocar through which the tube extends. These fields of movement are not versatile, and may be inadequate for purposes of a given surgery. Additionally, tensioning the Bilweis device requires the assistance of a second medical professional.","In overcoming these and other disadvantages of the prior art, the invention provides a surgical vacuum device including a vacuum cup sized for attachment to and manipulation of a target tissue. For the purposes of this disclosure, the term target tissue will be used to indicate any tissue to which the device will be applied, and specifically includes organs as well as any other bodily tissue, even if it is not specifically stated. The device further includes a vacuum hose for applying a vacuum to the interior of the cup, and structure for applying a tensioning force to the cup once it has been placed and a vacuum applied. The tensioning structure may be in the form of the vacuum hose itself, a control shaft, a handle, or tensioning cords or hooks coupled to the cup either directly or via the elongated control shaft or handle, but preferably includes a combination of these forms. By so including a combination of manipulation mechanisms, the device provides the surgeon with an added range of motion of the cup, facilitating ease of both placement and application of a tensioning force. The vacuum device may be so utilized with minimal or no trauma to the target tissue or surrounding tissues.","The device may be readily utilized and is particularly desirable in laparoscopic procedures. A trocar is inserted through an incision with a surrounding sheath or cannula. Once the trocar is removed, a compressed cup is advanced through the sheath disposed in the incision. Manipulation of the cup in the abdomen, for example, is facilitated preferably using a combination of the tensioning structures to provide the surgeon with a device that may be utilized in a broad range of procedures.","The invention additionally provides an apparatus by which the tension may be held without the need of a surgical assistant. Once an appropriate traction force is applied to the cup, the tensioning structure, for example, the cord, the hooks, or the vacuum tube are secured in position. The cup may be tethered via the tensioning structure to an external framework such as a frame anchored to or adjacent to the surgical field or directly attached to a self retaining retractor at the incision, or a frame coupled to the table or the like. Alternately, the cup may be tethered to the patient himself via a clamp at the incision site or location.","The device may also be advantageously used to apply a tamponade at a wound site, rupture, laceration, or other bleeding site. By applying a mild vacuum to the site, the target site is squeezed, transmitting a mild pressure which slows or arrests bleeding. This procedure may be utilized both internally, and on external body surfaces as a sort of vacuum tourniquet until the site can be otherwise repaired or treated.","Turning now to the drawings, there is shown in  vacuum devices  of two different embodiments constructed in accordance with teachings of the invention. The device  includes a suction cup  having a back wall  from which a side wall  depends, the side wall  forming a basal opening  at a side wall edge  for placement on an organ, or other tissue. In order to minimize the possibility of damage or trauma to the body tissue, the side wall edge  may display a substantially rounded edge. It will be appreciated by those of skill in the art that this rounded edge may likewise facilitate sealing of the cup  against tissue, particularly in a mushroom-shaped cup  as illustrated in , inasmuch as the rounded edge may readily conform to certain irregularities in the tissue surface and maintain a sealing engagement as the tissue is drawn into the cup .","The cup  may be of a range of sizes and of various compositions, depending upon the particular application in which it is utilized as described below. The cup , however, will preferably run on the order of 3 to 205 mm (approximately 0.1 to 8 inches) in diameter, although it may be smaller or larger. The cup  may be of any appropriate shape, so long as a seal may be established with the target tissue, and a vacuum established and maintained at a workable level. The cup  illustrated in  has a generally mushroom shape, while the cup  illustrated in  has a generally bell shape. The cup  may be formed of any appropriate material which is acceptable for surgical usage. For example, the cup  may be formed of rubber, plastic, silastic, silicone, plastic such as polyethylene, or metals, such as stainless steel to provide desired cup characteristics for a given usage, e.g., level of flexibility. The currently preferred design utilizes a polyethylene material which results in a relatively transparent cup . In this way, the surgeon can readily visualize the interaction of the cup  with the tissue (see ) and identify potential problems with the engagement or adverse reaction with the tissue.","In order to introduce a vacuum into the cup , a vacuum opening  is provided in one of the walls ,  of the cup . A hose  connected to a standard vacuum source (not shown) is coupled to the opening  to direct the suction to the interior of the cup . The hose  is preferably composed of a flexible rubber or plastic, although it may be substantially rigid. While hose  may be coupled directly to the opening  during molding such that it forms a single piece, or ultrasonically welded or chemically bonded or the like, after molding. A hollow nipple  is preferably provided around which the hose  may be appropriately secured. Barbs  may be provided about the nipple in order to enhance the strength of the coupling. Alternately, or in conjunction with the barbs , the hose  may be chemically bonded, ultrasonically welded or the like to the cup  or nipple .","The device  also includes tractioning structure  by which the cup  may be manipulated once placement and vacuum has been achieved. This structure may be in the form of the hose  itself, which might function as a tether by which a tractive force may be applied. It will be appreciated that the tractioning structure , such as the hose , might additionally be of some assistance in manipulation and placement of the cup .","In the embodiment illustrated in , the nipple  is elongated to form a hollow stem , which acts as a control arm by which the cup  may be manipulated. In order to further facilitate manipulation of the cup  of , a handle  is coupled to the hollow stem . It will be appreciated that the handle  may be separate from the vacuum hose .","Further, manipulation of the cup  may be provided by an external or removable structure. As shown in , one or more elongated rods  having hooks  or the like on the distal ends may be provided, as shown in . The hooks  may be engaged with openings  in the device  to maneuver the cup  into a desired position on a tissue. Once positioned, the hooks  may be removed or used to apply a tractive force to the cup . Those of skill in the art will appreciate that, while they may be used on any design, the rods  and hooks  will be particularly useful in placement and manipulation of cups which do not include a handle or elongated stem, such as the cups disclosed in .","As shown in , a device  having the flexible hose  attached directly to the cup , or to only a short nipple , or a device  having no separate manipulation rod or handle may include an elongated, stiffening rod or stylet  which stiffens a segment of the hose  and acts as a control arm to permit manipulation of the cup . The stylet  is preferably hollow, and is disposed within the hose  substantially adjacent the cup  such that the rod  functions in a manner similar to the elongated stem  of , while allowing the application of a vacuum. The stylet  may further include a tether  or the like such that the rod  may be removed from the vacuum hose  by pulling the rod  axially therethrough. Alternately, a rigid sheath may be disposed around the hose  and slid in or out as needed.","A tractioning structure which includes a fraction cord  or the like may be provided. As illustrated in , the traction cord  may be coupled to the handle  by openings  through the handle . Alternately, the traction cord may be coupled to the cup  by way of ears  extending from the nipple , as shown in , or directly from the cup  as shown in .","Further, an alternate tractioning structure such as the structure disclosed, for example, in the following patents and publications related to obstetrical vacuum extractors may be utilized, the patents and publications being hereby incorporated by reference: U.S. Pat. Nos. 4,512,347; 4,620,544; 4,730,619; 5,395,379; 5,569,265; and 5,713,909; O'Grady et al., Vacuum Extraction in Modern Obstetric Practice, pp. 13-21 (The Parthenon Publishing Group, Inc. 1995); Vacca, Handbook of Vacuum Extraction in Obstetric Practice, pp. 1-12 (Edward Arnold 1992).","According to another feature of the invention, the traction applied to the cup  may be maintained mechanically, in lieu of an assistant or surgeon holding the traction by hand. For example, the cord  may be coupled to a frame  extending above the operating table , as illustrated in . The cord  may be clamped to the frame  at a sliding bracket , the frame  preferably comprising upright supports , which are bracketed to the table  at bracket , and a crossbar . The frame  is preferably positioned at the head of the table , as illustrated in , or at the foot of the table  such that it does not interfere with the surgeon's access to the surgical field .","Alternately, the device  may be coupled to a conventional self-retaining retractor  as illustrated in . While it may be coupled by any appropriate method, the traction cord  may be hooked on a lock nut  of the refractor . Similarly, during laparoscopic procedures, the cord  might be clipped via an appropriate clip  directly to the patient's skin, as illustrated in . It will be appreciated that in this particular application, the cord  or other tether is applied through one incision, while the suction hose  extends through another incision.","Additionally, according to one feature of the invention, once the cup  is properly placed on the tissue or organ, and the appropriate suction level established, the suction level may be maintained within an acceptable range without continuous adjustment of the pumping device. In order to so maintain the vacuum, a valve or clamp  of any known design may be provided between the cup  and the pump (not shown). As shown in , the clamp  may be disposed such that it simply crimps the flexible vacuum hose . In this way, the established vacuum will be essentially maintained on the tissue.","The vacuum device  may be utilized in procedures which are intra- or extra-cavitary, that is, procedures which involve body surfaces, orifices, or internal organs, and in both laparotomy and laparoscopic procedures. The device  can be utilized as a retractor by attaching to a target organ to allow for better visualization of other organs, as a manipulator to move target organs from one position to another, or as an extractor to \u201cdeliver\u201d organs from inside to outside of the body. The level of suction applied to the cup will be dependent not only upon the features of the device  including the size of the cup , but also on the features of the particular target organ and the type of movement which is required. It will be appreciated that the level of traction force applied will typically be lower than that used when delivering newborns, and, accordingly, vacuum required to prevent release of the cup from the target organ will generally be less than the vacuum level applied with an obstetrical vacuum extractor during delivery.","When a vacuum is applied to a suction cup  on a structure having a blood flow, blood will typically pool inside the site, which may lead to the formation of a hematoma. When an obstetrical vacuum extractor is applied to a fetal scalp during vacuum extraction assisted deliveries of newborns, for example, occasionally a small bruise or hematoma occurs on the scalp (cephalohematoma). Additionally, some soft tissue edema and swelling may occur on the area of the scalp where the vacuum was applied. This is called a \u201cchinion\u201d or \u201ccaput.\u201d Similar results may be possible in tissue to which the invention is applied, but the occurrence and extent of such reactions will be dependent upon the vascularization of the target tissue, the length of time the tissue or organ is held, the material from which the cup  is formed, and the level of suction applied. For example, a hematoma may be possible for tissues such as uterine muscle, while it would not be likely in pathologic or physiologic cystic entities, such as ovarian cysts. It will be appreciated, however, that these effects are less likely to result in target tissue during use of the present invention because the level of vacuum applied to such tissue to maintain a traction force is generally considerably less than that required during vacuum assisted delivery.","The device  is particularly useful during laparoscopic procedures. In order to permit the device  to be moved into place through a small incision typical in laparoscopic surgery, the cup  is preferably formed of a relatively flexible, but resilient material such that the cup  may be advanced through a sheath, cannula, trocar, or other endoscopic device into the body cavity. For example, an incision may be made, a trocar (not shown) and sleeve, cannula, or sheath  inserted into the incision , and the trocar removed. The flexible cup  for use in laparoscopic procedures is preferably formed of a natural rubber or polymer material such as, for example, silastic, flexible rubber, or a thermoplastic elastomer such as Kraton. Referring to , a flexible cup  constructed in accordance with teachings of this invention is schematically illustrated folded within a cannula or sheath  for delivery through a body cavity through the sheath  inserted into the small incision . Once the suction cup  is intra-cavitarily positioned, the sheath  may be withdrawn slightly from the cup  as illustrated in .","In the embodiment illustrated in , the elongated hollow stem  may be used to advance the cup  and to position the cup . A vacuum may then be applied via the vacuum hose , and an appropriate traction applied to the stem  or hose  to pull the tissue toward the incision  site. Under this application of tension, the hose  must be securely coupled to the cup  and preferably be made of strong flexible rubber or plastic. Using this arrangement, much thought must be given to the location of the incision  to provide optimal traction in a desired direction to facilitate surgery. Once traction is applied and a clamp device used on the exterior portion of the hose  can both serve to block egress of the vacuum and anchor the hose  firmly to the body wall above the incision , as shown, for example, in . In this way, the clamp device affixes the hose  in the stretched or tension position to the abdominal wall to maintain the retraction. Alternately, a plastic or metal clamp or the like may be used to affix the device  to another part of the patient or other structure, such as the table, as illustrated in , for example.","It will be appreciated, however, that the cup  may be applied to the target tissue and maneuvered according to any of the arrangements disclosed herein. For example, the cup  in , the cup of  is inserted through a trocar  extending through a first incision and by means of the stylet . If the stylet  is then withdrawn to just below the incision line, the hose  becomes flexible. The tether  or rods  with hooks may likewise be delivered through the original trocar or sheath or they may be extended through a second incision , as illustrated in , and utilized to manipulate the cup  or apply a tensioning force. In this way, the cup  may be tensioned or manipulated at an angle other than would generally be attainable when manipulating the device  through a single incision.","By way of example, during a typical surgery for excising an ovarian cyst intact, the cup will be applied to the ovary adjacent or over the cyst area. An incision is then made with a second device through a second sheath to expose the cyst and the surrounding ovarian tissue. The cup is then reapplied directly to the cyst wall. Traction is asserted on the cup and cyst, and counter-dissection performed to free the cyst from the surrounding ovary. Suction is maintained and the cyst is pulled through the original incision or through a second abdominal or transvaginal incision intact. It will be appreciated that the original incision may need slight widening if it is utilized. Similar procedures may be utilized for excising or manipulating tumors in neurosurgical or urological surgeries.","Returning to , when the vacuum is no longer required, the suction may be released by, for example, opening the valve or clamp. The flaccid suction cup  may then be reintroduced to the sheath , and the sheath removed along with the suction cup  from the body by asserting traction on the hose , stem , or other structure.","It will be appreciated by those of skill in the art that the vacuum device  may be utilized in a variety of procedures. For example, occasionally internal organs can become adherent to the abdomen or pelvic sidewalls or to other structures rendering them fixed and immovable. A suction cup appropriately sized for the target organ may be disposed, suction applied, and traction or counter-traction applied gently to retract the organ or to lift it out of the body cavity so that adhesions may be lysed by the surgeon or assistant surgeon. Should other tissue obscure visualization of the target organ or adhesions, additional suction devices may be applied.","The suction device  is particularly effective in surgery or gynecological surgery involving the extraction or removal of tumors from within organ structures. For example, fibroid tumors (smooth muscle tumors of varying shapes and sizes with rounded smooth surfaces) often are embedded in the wall of the uterus. When the uterine wall is dissected and the tumor exposed, a surgeon's assistant typically uses sharp extraction instruments, such as clamps or hooks, to put traction on the tumor while the surgeon bluntly and sharply dissects the tumor free from the organ. According to the invention, the suction device  can be applied to the tumor and traction applied as the surgeon dissects the tumor from the organ. In this way, the surgeon can avoid the additional blood loss that accompanies the use of sharp tools to extract the tumor, as such sharp tools often cause maceration and laceration of the tissues during traction. While the optimal diameter of the cup  may vary as it is chosen to correlate with the diameter of the structure to be removed or extracted, it has been determined that a vacuum device  including a cup  having a diameter on the order of 20 mm up to 80-100 mm and formed of a plastic, metal, silastic, or rubber material is particularly useful in this type of surgery.","By way of further example, if one ovary is attached to a pathologic entity such as a fallopian tube with an ectopic pregnancy and the ovary must remain intact, the suction cup  can be applied to the ovary, a vacuum applied, and the adhesions or attachment between the tube and ovary can be better visualized and any attachments more safely lysed. This avoids any sharp instrument being used to manipulate either the tube or ovary, avoiding complications which may lead to bleeding, infection, or unnecessary removal of adjacent normal organs. It has been determined that a vacuum device  including a cup  having a diameter on the order of 10-50 mm and formed of a flexible plastic, silastic or rubber material is particularly useful in this type of surgery. Similarly formed cups of the following diameters are likewise desirable for the following types of tissues during various procedures: gallbladder, 20-50 mm; uterus 40-100 mm; fibroid 10-100 mm; large ectopic pregnancy, 20-50 mm; cecum (transfixion through laparoscope as assistance in appendectomy), 20-50 mm; tumors, 20-100 mm.","According to another aspect of the invention, the vacuum device  may be utilized as a tamponade for bleeding tissue. Thus, if a tissue displays a site which is bleeding, the cup  and the vacuum may be applied at that site until the surgery can progress sufficiently to repair or remove the structure in question. For example, if there is a ruptured ovarian cyst or ectopic pregnancy noted during surgery, laparoscopic or otherwise, a suction cup  can be applied adjacent or over the bleeding site, and negative pressure applied to curtail bloodflow in and around the bleeding site until the organ or pathologic entity can be safely treated or excised.  schematically illustrates an organ  having a ruptured cyst or other laceration . Under these circumstances, a cup  may be positioned over the laceration site  and sufficient vacuum applied to squeeze the tissue surrounding the site and transmit pressure on the periphery of the site, closing the aperture of the laceration to either slow or completely stop the bleeding.","While this aspect of the invention has been described with regard to a bleeding area on an internal tissue, the procedure is likewise applicable to the exterior surface of the body such that the vacuum device  acts as vacuum tourniquet of sorts. The cup  is applied to a wound and the applied vacuum transmits the tissue deep in the wound site to create a tamponade or pressure effect, much like applying pressure to a bleeding wound. In this way, the procedure is particularly useful on the torso of the body, where a tourniquet could not be applied. The procedure may readily be applied in trauma situations where facilities are unavailable for full treatment of the wound. In an era when blood loss may necessitate transfusion, and transfusion can introduce pathogens such as the AIDS and hepatitis virus to the recipient, any strategy which can efficiently curtail or arrest blood loss as a temporizing method during surgery should be welcomed by the surgical community.","In an embodiment of the invention, shown in  a first passageway  extends from the inside cup  through the forward portion of the framework  into fluid communication with the forward end of cylinder  to allow liquids or gases to be drawn from cup  as it embraces the head of the fetus to draw a vacuum thereon and maintain a secure connection allowing the physician to pull the head of the fetus partially through the birth canal upon the uterine contraction of the mother during the birthing process. A first check valve  is configured to allow the passage of fluid through a first passageway  from the cup  into the cylinder upon the retraction of the piston . However, the first check valve  is oriented to prevent the reinjection of withdrawn fluids into the cup  upon the forward advance of the piston after the vacuum is released in cup  at the cessation of the contraction of the mother.","In an embodiment of the invention, shown in  in order to expel the liquids and gases withdrawn through the first passageway  into the cylinder  a second or exhaust passageway or opening  is provided. The second passageway  opens into the first passageway  and as the piston  reciprocates toward the forward end of the cylinder , the check valve  closes and the fluids are forced to flow through the second passageway  which allows the discharge of such fluids through a second check valve .","In an embodiment of the invention, shown in  a third passageway  is formed in the frame to extend to the first passageway  intermediate the cup  and the first check valve . Its outermost opening at a remote area of the frame, is closed by a sealing valve  having a thumb lever  which allows the physician to use his thumb to depress lever  and thereby lift the sealing valve  and open the third passageway  to the atmosphere. Opening the sealing valve  allows air from the atmosphere to flow through the passages  and  into cup  and thereby relieve the vacuum created by the retraction of piston  in cylinder ."],"BRFSUM":[{},{}],"brief-description-of-drawings":[{},{}],"description-of-drawings":{"heading":"BRIEF DESCRIPTION OF THE DRAWINGS","p":[{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0013","num":"0012"},"figref":"FIG. 1"},{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0014","num":"0013"},"figref":"FIG. 2"},{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0015","num":"0014"},"figref":"FIG. 3"},{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0016","num":"0015"},"figref":"FIG. 4"},{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0017","num":"0016"},"figref":["FIG. 5","FIG. 1"]},{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0018","num":"0017"},"figref":["FIG. 6","FIG. 3"]},{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0019","num":"0018"},"figref":["FIG. 7","FIG. 2"]},{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0020","num":"0019"},"figref":["FIGS. 8-13","FIG. 1"]},{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0021","num":"0020"},"figref":"FIGS. 14A and 14B"},{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0022","num":"0021"},"figref":"FIG. 15"},{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0023","num":"0022"},"figref":"FIG. 16"}]},"DETDESC":[{},{}]}
