title: Head restraint device for use with a high performance vehicle
abstract: A head and neck restraint device for being worn by a driver while operating a high performance vehicle in which the device controls the driver's head from snapping forward and downwards during a frontal vehicular crash. The device includes a pair of anchor straps that are worn along the back of the driver. The straps are adapted for being connected to the driver's helmet and for being anchored to either the vehicle's seat belt assembly and/or to the driver's legs. The restraint device itself does not inhibit the driver from exiting the vehicle as exiting may occur after simply unlatching the vehicle's seat belt assembly. Moreover, since the restraint device is neither rigid nor bulky the driver may quickly exit the vehicle without being restricted by the device.

No. 09\/993,839, filed Nov. 16,2001, now U.S. Pat. No. 6,499,149; which is a continuation-in-part U.S. patent application Ser. No. 09\/837,215, filed Apr. 19, 2001, which is now abandoned.

No. 09\/837,215, filed Apr. 19, 2001, which is now abandoned.","The present invention relates to a method and apparatus for controlling a driver's head and neck when subjected to deceleration forces, and more particularly, to a device for controlling the forward and downward movement of the head and neck of a driver during a frontal crash of a high performance vehicle.","Currently, drivers of high performance vehicles use a standard five or six point seat belt assembly in which all the straps tie into a common buckle to restrain the driver during a crash. However, these seat belts do not restrain the driver's head or neck, allowing the head to uncontrollably snap forward when the vehicle is subject to a frontal impact. This uncontrolled movement of the head has resulted in serious injury and death.","Recent efforts to improve safety for high performance vehicle drivers include devices designed to restrain the head and neck of the driver during a frontal crash. One such device is the \u201cHanns Device\u201d, described in U.S. Pat. No. 6,009,566 to Hubbard, which includes a rigid yoke worn by the driver to which a safety helmet is tethered.","Unfortunately, because of the rigid bulky yoke, the Hanns Device itself may be a safety hazard by impeding the driver from exiting the vehicle during an emergency situation. With high performance vehicles, egress into and out of the vehicle is through the driver-side window frame. When a vehicle crash occurs it is important that the driver quickly escape from the vehicle. This need to quickly exit the vehicle is particularly critical when the driver and\/or vehicle is on fire or the driver is seriously injured. However, since the yoke is stiff and bulky, the Hanns Device can impede the driver from exiting the vehicle by making it more difficult to fit through the driver-side window frame. Consequently, valuable time in removing the driver from a dangerous crash site and to treat the driver may be lost.","Another disadvantage of the Hanns Device is that the driver's seat must be modified to accommodate the bulky yoke. Accordingly, additional expense is incurred and the device cannot be used in vehicles which have not been modified.","A further disadvantage of the Hanns Device is that the rigid bulky yoke is uncomfortable to some drivers and unnecessarily restricts their mobility when operating the vehicle.","Other head and neck restraints do not have a positive anchor into which forces from the head and neck can be transferred. Instead, they are mounted to a transient object, such as the driver's clothing or to a chest or waist strap. Accordingly, these types of devices do not provide the needed restraint during impact.","What is needed is a device which restrains a driver's head and neck during a frontal crash with a vehicle. Additionally, needed is for the device to be comfortable and to not impede the driver's egress into and out of the vehicle.","The applicant is aware of the following U.S. Patents concerning a race car helmet restraint:",{"@attributes":{"id":"P-d0e941","num":"00002"},"tables":{"@attributes":{"id":"TABLE-US-00001","num":"00001"},"table":{"@attributes":{"frame":"none","colsep":"0","rowsep":"0"},"tgroup":{"@attributes":{"align":"left","colsep":"0","rowsep":"0","cols":"4"},"colspec":[{"@attributes":{"colname":"1","colwidth":"49pt","align":"left"}},{"@attributes":{"colname":"2","colwidth":"35pt","align":"left"}},{"@attributes":{"colname":"3","colwidth":"49pt","align":"left"}},{"@attributes":{"colname":"4","colwidth":"84pt","align":"left"}}],"thead":{"row":[{"entry":{"@attributes":{"namest":"1","nameend":"4","align":"center","rowsep":"1"}}},{"entry":["U.S. Pat.

The head restraint has a restraining strap which applies a single force to the head to restrain the head from horizontal forward motion and a strap assembly on the helmet to hold the head upright. The restraining strap pulls the head directly back near the middle of the head and helmet. The restraining strap only applies the force when the deceleration forces are above a predetermined level. The attachment of the strap to the helmet allows the helmet to rotate about a vertical axis approximately 180 degree. The restraint can also be connected to the torso of the occupant to simultaneously retract the head and the torso. The restraint must be detached for the occupant to exit the vehicle.","Adams et al. describes a seat insert for a vehicle which maintains an occupant of the vehicle in a forward position during high G acceleration. The seat insert has a head support member for supporting the occupant's head during a forward, leaning posture. A head support member restraint cord is provided to restrain the movement of the head support member during the occupant's forward lean. The top and bottom of the helmet are restrained to the head support member which is behind and above the top of the helmet. The head support member tends to resist motions of the occupant's head which are downward due to accelerations. The seat insert also includes a back plate assembly connected to the head support member for supporting the spine in its natural curvature. The back plate assembly is able to pivot forward relative to the seat of the vehicle. The seat insert is able to transfer G-induced weight from the spine to the back plate assembly and ultimately to the existing seat of the vehicle. The seat insert restrains the driver relative to the seat and must rely on restraint of the torso to be compatible with the head restraint for restraining the head relative to the torso.","Monson et al. describes a head support apparatus which can be attached to a body support device. The apparatus includes a beam housing attachable to the body support device such as to be rigid in the y-z plane but to be rotatable about a x-axis. The x-axis is defined as extending through the subject's face to the back of the head. The y-axis is defined as extending laterally from ear to ear and the z-axis is defined as extending vertically from the top of the head through the subject's chin. A U-shaped rigid beam is mountable in a channel of the beam housing such that the beam is rigidly supported within the x-y plane but is able to be rotated about the x-axis. Helmet attachments are provided for supporting the helmet relative to the rigid beam within the x-z plane but allowing rotation of the helmet about the y-axis.","Allan describes a head restraining system including a helmet having a chin protector formed thereon, a keeper plate overlying the shoulders, upper chest, including the sternum area, and upper back of the driver, a plurality of straps connecting the shoulder, chest and back portion of the keeper plate to aligned portions of the helmet and a pair of shoulder straps securing the keeper plate to the driver.","Landau describes a brain and spinal cord protector which is provided to protect the brain and spinal cord of a user against a fall. The protector comprises a jacket which is worn about the user's torso, a head shield shaped to cover the user's head, a support extending from the jacket to the head shield to position the head shield above the jacket so that the inner surface of the head shield is spaced from the user's head.","Hubbard describes the head and neck restraint device for occupants of high performance vehicles. The support device includes a restraining yoke and a collar. The restraining yoke has two front portions which extend out from the shoulders of the driver along the torso of the occupant, and also include a rear portion which extends behind the neck and shoulders of the occupant. The collar of the device extends upwards from the rear portion of the restraining yoke behind the head of the occupant. The collar of the device is connected by tethers to the helmet worn by the occupant. Shoulder belts of the shoulder harness provided in the vehicle extend over the front portion and rear portion of the restraining yoke when the device is mounted on the occupant such that the device is between shoulder belt and the occupant. The collar acts to transfer forces from the helmet through the tethers to the collar of the restraining yoke which transfers the forces to the shoulder harness thereby reducing the forces being transmitted to the neck of the occupant.","The invention is a method and apparatus for controlling a driver's head and neck during a frontal crash of a high performance vehicle. The device connects the driver's helmet to the vehicle seat belt assembly to transfer forces from the helmet, through the device, to the seat belt assembly. During normal operation, the device is worn on the driver and does not impede the driver's mobility while operating the vehicle or while entering or exiting the vehicle. During an impact, the harness device keeps the driver's head and neck in alignment with the driver's spine to keep the head from snapping forward.","In the broadest sense, the present invention is a restraint device for controlling the head and neck of a driver during a frontal crash of a vehicle. The restraint device includes at least one anchor strap having a first end positionable along the back of the driver and a second end positionable between the legs of the driver. A first attachment means is attached to the first end of the anchor straps for releasably attaching to an article wearable on the driver. A second attachment means is attached to the second end of the anchor strap for releasably attaching to a seat belt assembly. When the vehicle is subjected to frontal impact, the anchor strap is placed in tension and restrains the head and neck of the wearer from snapping forward. In particular, the restraint device may be attached to a helmet, skull cap or head band.","Also in the broadest sense, the present invention is a restraint device for controlling the head and neck of a driver during a frontal crash of the vehicle in which the restraint device includes at least one anchor strap having a first end positionable along the back of the driver and having a second end. An attachment means is provided on the first end for attaching to an article wearable on a wearer's head. The restraint device also includes first and second leg straps which extend from the second end of the anchor strap for encircling the legs of the wearer. When the vehicle is subjected to a frontal impact, the anchor strap is placed in tension, restraining the wearer's head from snapping forward.","Further in the broadest sense, the present invention is a restraint restraining a wearer during a vehicle impact. The restraint device includes at least one strap extending along the back of the wearer, a first means for attaching the strap to an article wearable on the wearer's head, and a second means for attaching said strap to a seat belt assembly. Preferably, the article is a helmet, skull cap or head strap. Optionally, the restraint device can be provided with front tethers which extend from a frontal strap on the restraint device. The front tethers are attachable to the article wearable on the wearer's head.","The principal object of the present invention is to provide a head restraint device for controlling a driver's head and neck during a frontal crash of a high performance vehicle.","Another object of the invention is to provide a head restraint device which is carried on the driver.","A further object of the invention is to provide a head restraint device which is not bulky.","Another object of the invention is to provide a head restraint device which is not rigid.","A further object of the invention is to provide head restraint device which is comfortable to wear.","Another object of the invention is to provide a head restraint device which does not impede ingress or egress into or out of a vehicle.","Another object of the invention is to provide a head restraint device which releaseably attaches to a high performance vehicle seat belt assembly and to a safety helmet.","A further object of the invention is to provide a head restraint device which maintains the head and neck of a driver in alignment with the driver's spine during a frontal impact of a high performance vehicle.","Another object of the invention is to provide a head restraint device which transfers forces from a driver's helmet to a vehicle's seat belt assembly during a frontal impact of the vehicle.","The invention is a device for restraining and controlling a driver's head and neck during a frontal crash of a high performance vehicle. The restraint device accomplishes this task by connecting the driver's helmet to a standard five or six point seat belt assembly which serves as a hard point between the device and the vehicle. During normal operation, the device does not impede the driver's mobility while operating the vehicle, or while entering or exiting the vehicle. During an impact, the device transfers forces from the helmet, through the device, to the seat belt assembly to keep the head and neck in alignment with the spine and to keep the driver's head from snapping forward.","The present invention incorporates by reference the following: U.S. Utility patent application Filed Nov. 16, 2001, Ser. No. 09\/993,839 issued Dec. 31, 2002 as U.S. Pat. No. 6,499,149 B2; and Design Patent Application Filed May 31, 2002, Ser. No. 29\/161,634.","Referring now to the drawings, and particularly to , the restraint device  is comprised of a plurality of interconnected straps which are worn by the driver. The straps include a pair of anchor straps  positionable along the back of the driver and having a first end  for releasably attaching to a helmet (not shown) and a second end  for releasably attaching to a seat belt assembly (not shown); chest and waist straps ,  respectively disposed horizontally about the upper torso and lower torso of the driver; and a pair of shoulder straps  for maintaining the device  in position on the driver. The straps can be made of any suitable material such as nylon webbing, polyester, and cotton. Although the straps can be made with different widths, preferably the anchor straps , chest strap  and waist strap  are each 1 inch (2.54 cm) wide.","When worn, the anchor straps  extend along the driver's back with the first ends  terminating at or about shoulder height and the second end  wrapped forwardly between the driver's legs for attachment to the seat belt assembly. The first ends  of the anchor straps  are generally parallel and spaced apart a distance approximately equivalent to the width of a racing helmet. The second ends  of the anchor straps  converge towards each other where they may be combined into a single strap , as shown in , or remain as two separate straps, as shown in  webbing slide adjuster  is provided at the second ends  of the anchor straps  to provide height adjustment of the device to accommodate different drivers.","The free terminus of the second end  of each anchor strap  attaches to a seat belt anchor  having a tongue  for releasably attaching to a vehicle's five point or six point seat belt assembly which serves as a \u201chard point\u201d into which forces applied to the device  are transferred.","The free terminus of the first end  of each anchor strap  is provided with a D-ring  for attachment to a complementary helmet tether  which attaches the helmet to the anchor strap . Each helmet tether  has a upper end  having a quick release helmet hook  for releasably attaching to a D-ring helmet clip , and an opposing lower end  adjustably attachable to the anchor strap D-ring . Each quick release helmet hook  is provided with a latch  to which a quick release tether  is attached to provide a quick and simple means for detaching the device  from the helmet.","In an alternative embodiment (not shown), the anchor straps  can be lengthened to be directly attached to the helmet. In this embodiment, the D-rings  provided on the anchor straps  are replaced by quick release helmet hooks for releasably attaching the anchor straps  to the D-ring helmet clips . A webbing slide adjuster is provided on the first ends of the anchor straps  to adjust the anchor straps  to the helmet to accommodate drivers of different heights.","Referring to , the D-ring helmet hooks  are provided on opposed sides of the helmet shell so that the helmet tethers and first ends  of anchor straps  run generally vertically downward from, and parallel to, the sides of the helmet. This predetermined spacing of the first ends  of the anchor straps , and the second ends  of the anchor straps  tying into the seat belt assembly, reduces the magnitude of torsion forces applied to the driver's neck during a crash by generally equally loading the anchor straps  on each side of the driver's head. Accordingly, the anchor straps  tend to maintain the driver's head in a forward facing position and control the driver's head from snapping forward.","The chest strap  is generally horizontally disposed and is secured perpendicular to the first ends  of the anchor straps  by sewing or the like. The anchor straps  are separated along the chest strap  by the predetermined distance which is approximately equal to the outer width of the helmet shell. When the anchor straps  are placed in tension, the chest strap  maintains the spacing between the anchor straps  at the predetermined distance.","The chest strap  is provided with a buckle  at one end and a complementary tongue  at the opposed end so that the ends of the chest strap  can be releasably fastened together once disposed about the driver. The chest strap  is also provided with a webbing tie  for length adjustment of the chest strap  so that the device  can be tightened against the driver and can be worn by drivers of different girth.","The waist strap  is generally horizontally disposed beneath the chest strap  and is secured perpendicular to the anchor straps  by sewing or the like. The anchor straps  are separated along the waist strap  by a predetermined distance. When the anchor straps  are placed in tension, the waist strap  maintains the spacing between the anchor straps . The waist strap  is provided with a buckle  at one end and a complementary tongue  at the opposed end so that the ends of the waist strap  can be releasably fastened together once the strap is disposed about the driver. The waist strap  is provided with a webbing tie  for length adjustment so that the device can be tightened against the driver and can accommodate different sized drivers.","The pair of shoulder straps  extend from the anchor straps  to the chest strap  and are attached to these straps ,  by sewing or the like. The shoulder straps  have sufficient length to define a suitable space through which the driver's arms and shoulders can be received. The shoulder straps  do not perform a safety function, but instead assist in holding the device  in position on the driver when the device  is not connected to the driver's helmet, particularly when the driver is in a standing position, such as before entering or after exiting the vehicle.","An alternative embodiment of the restraint device  is shown in FIG. . The device  is as described above, and similarly numbered, except that the second ends  of the anchor straps  are attachable to the driver's legs instead of the seat belt assembly. In the alternative embodiment, leg straps  are provided at the free terminus of the second end  of the anchor straps . The driver's legs are inserted through the leg straps  which snugly fit around the driver's upper thigh. The mass of the driver's legs anchors the device  against decelerations forces applied to the driver's head and neck. A secondary strap  can also be provided which attaches the leg straps  to the waist strap . Additionally, a suitable adjustment means (not shown), such as a webbing tie, can be provided to tighten or loosen the leg straps so that a snug fit is universally achieved about the driver's upper thighs.","Any of the previously described embodiments can be made integral with a driver's racing suit to make getting into and out of the device easier. For example, the restraint devices ,  shown in  can be attached to the racing suit  as illustrated in . Suitable means can be used integrate the restraint device ,  into the suit such as, for example, sewing the device thereto. In such a case, the shoulder straps  would be optional as a suit would carry the restraint device. Moreover, the chest and waist straps ,  would be optional since spacing of the anchor straps  would be achieved by sewing the anchor straps  into the suit at the predetermined locations.","Referring to , to attach the integrated device  to the helmet and seat belt assembly, the first ends  of the anchor straps  exit from a shoulder portion of the racing suit  for attachment to the helmet tethers  or to the helmet. Likewise, the free terminus of the second ends  of the anchor straps  extend from the racing suit between the legs of the driver, to expose the seat belt anchor  for attachment to the seat belt assembly.","Referring to , to attach the integrated device  to the helmet, the first ends  of the anchor straps  exit from a shoulder portion of the racing suit  for attachment to the helmet tethers  or to the helmet. The drivers' legs are inserted through the leg straps  which snugly fit around the driver's upper thighs. Optionally, a secondary strap  can be provided which attaches the leg straps  to the waist strap . Additionally, a suitable adjustment means, such as a webbing tie, can be provided to tighten and loosen the leg straps so that a snug fit is achieved about the driver's upper thigh.","Any of the previously described restraint devices can be attached to a helmet at more than one location (not shown). For example, the helmet can be provided with forward and rearward clips on each side of the helmet. A pair of Y-shaped tethers can attach the restraint device to the helmet clips.","Referring to , another embodiment of a head restraint device  is shown. The restraint device  illustrates front tethers  in addition to rear tethers . The front tethers  extend from straps  at the front torso of the driver, for attachment to a helmet. The front and rear tethers ,  may attach to the same helmet clips, or may attach to separate helmet clips. Front tethers may be provided on any of the previously described embodiments.","Any of the previously described restraint devices, such as the device  illustrated in , may be attached to a head band, skull cap (not shown), or the like, which is worn beneath the helmet. The head band comprises a band that encircles the driver's head and tethers that extend from the band and are attachable to the restraint device D-rings may be used to releasably secure the tethers to the restraint device.","Referring to , in use, the device  is attached to the driver by inserting the driver's arms and shoulders through the shoulder straps  with the anchor straps  disposed along the back of the driver. The waist and chest straps ,  are wrapped around and buckled in front of the driver. Helmet tethers  are attached to the helmet clip  and the lower ends  of the tethers  are tied to the anchor strap D-rings . The anchor straps , chest strap  and waist strap  are adjusted as necessary to properly fit the driver. The device  is then carried on the driver as the driver enters the vehicle. Once in the vehicle, the seat belt anchor  is secured to the vehicle's seat belt assembly and any final adjustments to the various straps are made.","Referring to , in the event of a frontal or angular frontal impact to the vehicle, the anchor straps  are placed in tension loaded by the driver's head and body forward travel. Under tension, the anchor straps  pull against forward travel of the driver's head and neck to keep them general alignment with the spine. Accordingly, the driver's head is restrained from snapping forward. Moreover, since the tethers  and first ends  of the anchor straps  extend vertically downward from the sides of the helmet, and are separated the predetermined distance by the chest and waist straps , , the device  limits torsion forces applied to the driver's neck.","The restraint device  illustrated in  functions as previously described except that the amount of tension in which the anchor straps  can be placed is limited by the resisting force of the driver's legs instead of the seat belt assembly. Consequently, under certain circumstances, the anchor straps  could pull up the legs of the driver thereby allowing the driver's head to move forward a greater amount than if the device  were secured to the seat belt assembly.","If the driver is involved in a crash, the restraint device  is advantageously not permanently mounted to the vehicle. Hence, to exit the vehicle, the driver simply unlatches the seat belt assembly and the restraint device  is simultaneously released from the seat belt assembly. Since the device  moves with the driver and is neither bulky nor rigid, the driver can quickly exit the vehicle unrestricted by the device .","From the foregoing, it is readily apparent that I have invented a race car driver head and neck restraint device to be worn,by a driver while operating a high performance vehicle. The device maintains the driver's head and neck in general alignment with the driver's spine in the event of frontal crash by the vehicle. The restraint device is carried on the driver and is releasably attachable at one end to a safety helmet and that the other end to a standard seat belt assembly of vehicle. The restraint device is neither bulky nor rigid and therefore does not impede egress into and out of the vehicle.","It is to be understood that the foregoing description and specific embodiments are merely illustrative of the best mode of the invention and the principles thereof, and that various modifications and additions may be made to the apparatus by those skilled in the art, without departing from the spirit and scope of this invention, which is therefore understood to be limited only by the scope of the appended claims."],"BRFSUM":[{},{}],"brief-description-of-drawings":[{},{}],"description-of-drawings":{"heading":"BRIEF DESCRIPTION OF THE DRAWINGS","p":["The foregoing and other objects will become more readily apparent by referring to the following detailed description and the appended drawings in which:",{"@attributes":{"id":"P-00032","num":"00032"},"figref":"FIG. 1"},{"@attributes":{"id":"P-00033","num":"00033"},"figref":["FIG. 2","FIG. 1"]},{"@attributes":{"id":"P-00034","num":"00034"},"figref":"FIG. 3"},{"@attributes":{"id":"P-00035","num":"00035"},"figref":["FIG. 4","FIG. 2"]},{"@attributes":{"id":"P-00036","num":"00036"},"figref":["FIG. 5","FIG. 2"]},{"@attributes":{"id":"P-00037","num":"00037"},"figref":["FIG. 6","FIG. 1"]},{"@attributes":{"id":"P-00038","num":"00038"},"figref":["FIG. 7","FIG. 1"]},{"@attributes":{"id":"P-00039","num":"00039"},"figref":["FIG. 8","FIG. 3"]},{"@attributes":{"id":"P-00040","num":"00040"},"figref":["FIG. 9","FIG. 3"]},{"@attributes":{"id":"P-00041","num":"00041"},"figref":"FIG. 10"},{"@attributes":{"id":"P-00042","num":"00042"},"figref":["FIG. 11","FIG. 10"]},{"@attributes":{"id":"P-00043","num":"00043"},"figref":["FIG. 12","FIG. 11"]}]},"DETDESC":[{},{}]}
