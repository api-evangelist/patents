title: Method and apparatus for creating templates
abstract: A template creator creates a template class that stores at least one template parameter. The template creator also specifies at least one additional object to be created when an instance of the template class is created. A template user initiates the creation of a new instance of the template class. If an error occurs during the creation of the new instance of the template class, the template user receives a report identifying the error.

{"@attributes":{"id":"description"},"RELAPP":[{},{}],"heading":["RELATED APPLICATIONS","TECHNICAL FIELD","BACKGROUND","SUMMARY","DETAILED DESCRIPTION"],"p":["This application is a Continuation of Ser. No. 10\/081,442, U.S. Pat. No. 7,100,167, filed Feb. 19, 2002, and issued Aug. 29, 2006, entitled \u201cMethod and Apparatus for Creating Templates\u201d, and incorporated herein by reference.","That application is a continuation-in-part of Ser. No. 09\/847,534, U.S. Pat. No. 7,275,250 filed May 1, 2001, and issued Sep. 25, 2007, entitled \u201cMethod and Apparatus for Correlating Events\u201d, and also incorporated herein by reference.","The present invention relates to computing systems and, more particularly, to a language for describing templates used to collect and correlate various events generated throughout a computing environment.","Computer systems, such as servers and desktop personal computers, are expected to operate without constant monitoring. These computer systems typically perform various tasks without the user's knowledge. When performing these tasks, the computer system often encounters events that require a particular action (such as logging the event, generating an alert for a particular system or application, or performing an action in response to the event). Various mechanisms are available to handle these events.","A computing enterprise typically includes one or more networks, services, and systems that exchange data and other information with one another. The enterprise may include one or more security mechanisms to safeguard data and authenticate users and may utilize one or more different data transmission protocols. At any particular time, one or more networks, services or systems may be down (e.g., powered down or disconnected from one or more networks). Networks, services or systems can be down for scheduled maintenance, upgrades, overload or failure. Application programs attempting to obtain event data must contend with the various networks, services, and systems in the enterprise when they are down. Additionally, application programs must contend with the security and network topology limitations of the enterprise as well as the various protocols used in the enterprise.","Operating system components, services, and applications generate a variety of different events. A particular component or application may request to be informed of a particular event (e.g., when a server crashes or when a user logs on to the system). Other components or applications may want to be notified when a particular series of events occur within a particular time period. For example, a network administrator may want to know when a server crashes within three seconds of a user logging into the system. Server crashes alone may be relatively common and user logins may also be common such that the network administrator is not particularly interested in either event by itself. However, when these two events occur within a few seconds of one another, there may be a relationship between the two events (e.g., the user login was at least partially responsible for the server crash).","Existing systems provide predefined functions that allow a network administrator or other user to create a relationship between two events. This relationship between two events is commonly referred to as a \u201ccorrelation\u201d between the two events. The predefined correlation functions provided by existing systems require the user to select from one of the predefined functions. If the correlation function desired by the user has not already been created, the user must request that the developer or supplier of the functions create a new function to meet the user's needs. If the developer or supplier is willing to create a new correlation function, this custom development work may be very expensive. Depending on the expected demand for the new correlation function, the developer or supplier may not be willing to create the requested function.","If the developer is unwilling to create a new correlation function or the cost is too high, the user can attempt to use an existing correlation function that is \u201cclosest\u201d to the user's requirements. Such a solution may result in a significant number of unwanted event notifications or may result in a failure to notify the user of a desired sequence of events.","The system and method described herein addresses the limitations of the prior art by providing a template description language that allows a user to develop functions that identify certain events and correlations between multiple events and\/or data.","The system and method described herein supports a template description language that allows a user to create templates that are used to correlate multiple events and\/or data elements. The templates created using the template description language in turn create state machines to execute a function, such as an event correlation function. The template description language supports the development of two general types of templates: correlation helper templates and correlation scenario templates. A correlation helper template is used to parameterize a particular aspect of a correlation scenario. The correlation helper template does not define a complete correlation scenario, but instead leaves one or more parameters to be defined by the user implementing the template. A correlation scenario template defines a specific correlation scenario and maintains its own correlation state. Correlation scenario templates can be used as building blocks to create larger, more complex correlation scenario templates. The templates described herein allow a user to develop templates to perform any desired event and\/or data correlation functions.","In one embodiment, a template creator creates a template class that stores at least one template parameter. The template creator specifies at least one additional object to be created when an instance of the template class is created. A template user initiates the creation of a new instance of the template class. If an error occurs during the creation of the new instance of the template class, the template user receives a report identifying the error.","Another embodiment creates a first template class and designates inputs and outputs associated with the first template class. A second template class is created and inputs and outputs associated with the second template class are designated. A third template class is created by combining the first template class and the second template class.","In a particular embodiment, a template description structure includes at least one template class that stores multiple template parameters. The template description structure also includes at least one template builder class that identifies at least one additional object to be created with each instance of the template class. The template description structure further includes at least one order parameter that identifies the order in which the template builder classes are instantiated.","The system and method described herein provides a template description language that allows a user to define templates that perform various correlation functions between events and\/or data. A correlation helper template is used to parameterize one or more aspects of a correlation scenario. The correlation helper template leaves one or more parameters to be defined by the user creating an instance of the template. A correlation scenario template may be used as a building block to create larger, more complex correlation scenario templates.","Web-Based Enterprise Management (WBEM) provides uniform access to management information throughout an enterprise. WBEM is an industry initiative to develop technology for accessing management information in an enterprise environment. This management information includes, for example, information on the state of system memory, inventories of currently installed client applications, and other information related to the status of the system. A particular embodiment of the event-handling system is represented using Windows Management Instrumentation (WMI) developed by Microsoft Corporation of Redmond, Wash., which provides an infrastructure to handle various events generated by event sources throughout an enterprise.","WMI technology enables systems, applications, networks, and other managed components to be represented using the Common Information Model (CIM) designed by the Distributed Management Task Force (DMTF). This model is used to perform correlation functions discussed herein. CIM is an extensible data model for representing objects that exist in typical management environments. CIM is able to model anything in the managed environment, regardless of the location of the data source. The Managed Object Format (MOF) language is used to define and store modeled data. In addition to data modeling, WMI provides a set of base services that include query-based information retrieval and event notification. Access to these services and to the management data is provided through a single programming interface.","WMI classes define the basic units of management. Each WMI class is a template for a type of managed object. For example, Win32_DiskDrive is a model representing a physical disk drive. For each physical disk drive that exists, there is an instance of the Win32_DiskDrive class. WMI classes may contain properties, which describe the data of the class and methods, which describe the behavior of the class.","WMI classes describe managed objects that are independent of a particular implementation or technology. WMI includes an eventing subsystem that follows the publish-subscribe model, in which an event consumer subscribes for a selection of events (generated by one or more event providers) and performs an action as a result of receiving the event. WMI also provides a centralized mechanism for collecting and storing event data. This stored event data is accessible by other systems via WMI tools and\/or application programming interfaces (APIs).","Although particular embodiments are discussed herein as using WMI, alternate embodiments may utilize any enterprise management system or application, whether web-based or otherwise. The event providers and event consumers discussed herein are selected for purposes of explanation. The teachings of the present invention can be used with any type of event provider and any type of event consumer. Additionally, the event-handling system and method described herein can be applied to any type of enterprise or other arrangement of computing devices, applications, and\/or networks.",{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0031","num":"0030"},"figref":"FIG. 1","b":["100","114","102","100","106","114","102","112","104"]},"Event providers  include, for example, systems, services or applications that generate event data. An exemplary event provider is a disk drive (or an application that monitors the status of a disk drive). The disk drive may generate an event indicating the available storage capacity on the disk drive or indicating the amount of data currently stored on the disk drive. The disk drive may also generate an event indicating that the disk drive is nearly full of data (e.g., when ninety-five percent or more of the disk drive's capacity is used).","Event consumers  may request to be notified of certain events (also referred to as \u201csubscribing\u201d to an event). An example event consumer is an application that manages multiple storage devices in an enterprise. The application may request to receive events generated by any of the disk drives or other storage devices in the enterprise. The application can use this event information to distribute storage tasks among the multiple storage devices based on the available capacity of each device and\/or the quantity of read or write requests received by each storage device.","System  also includes a set of policies , which are accessible by WMI module . Policies  may control the configuration of one or more systems in the enterprise. Other policies may define various activities, such as event filtering, event correlation, and the forwarding of events to particular devices or applications. A database  is coupled to WMI module . Database  stores various information related to the enterprise. For example, database  can store event data (i.e., creating an event log), policy data, and enterprise configuration information.","The WMI module  uses WMI features to provide a distributed architecture that is capable of selecting, filtering, correlating, forwarding, storing, and delivering event data in an enterprise. The WMI module also allows event consumers to request data related to a particular event, request data from a particular node or device in the enterprise, define the manner in which events are correlated with one another, define how certain events should be forwarded, and define how to store event data.","The WMI module  provides a policy-based administration of the enterprise. The policy infrastructure allows administrators to set a policy in the Directory Service (DS) and the WMI module ensures that the proper set of WMI objects (e.g., filters, bindings, correlators, consumers, and configuration objects) are delivered to the proper devices or applications in the enterprise.","As shown in , policies  and database  are separate from WMI module . However, in alternate embodiments, policies  and\/or database  may be integrated into WMI module .","Table 1 below identifies various types of event providers available in a particular embodiment. Additionally, the table includes a description of the events generated by each event provider. For example, the Win32 Provider generates events that include information related to the operating system, computer system, peripheral devices, file systems, and security for a particular device (such as a computer system) in the enterprise.",{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0039","num":"0038"},"tables":{"@attributes":{"id":"TABLE-US-00001","num":"00001"},"table":{"@attributes":{"frame":"none","colsep":"0","rowsep":"0"},"tgroup":{"@attributes":{"align":"left","colsep":"0","rowsep":"0","cols":"3"},"colspec":[{"@attributes":{"colname":"offset","colwidth":"14pt","align":"left"}},{"@attributes":{"colname":"1","colwidth":"70pt","align":"left"}},{"@attributes":{"colname":"2","colwidth":"133pt","align":"left"}}],"thead":{"row":[{"entry":[{},"TABLE 1"]},{"entry":[{},{"@attributes":{"namest":"offset","nameend":"2","align":"center","rowsep":"1"}}]},{"entry":[{},"Event Provider","Description of Events Provided"]},{"entry":[{},{"@attributes":{"namest":"offset","nameend":"2","align":"center","rowsep":"1"}}]}]},"tbody":{"@attributes":{"valign":"top"},"row":[{"entry":[{},"Win32 Provider","Supplies information about the"]},{"entry":[{},{},"operating system, computer system,"]},{"entry":[{},{},"peripheral devices, file systems, and"]},{"entry":[{},{},"security."]},{"entry":[{},"WDM Provider","Supplies low-level Windows Driver"]},{"entry":[{},{},"Model (WDM) information for user"]},{"entry":[{},{},"input devices, storage devices, network"]},{"entry":[{},{},"interfaces, and communications ports."]},{"entry":[{},"Performance","Exposes the raw performance counter"]},{"entry":[{},"Counter Provider","information used to compute various"]},{"entry":[{},{},"performance values."]},{"entry":[{},"Windows Installer","Supplies information about"]},{"entry":[{},"Provider","applications installed with the"]},{"entry":[{},{},"Windows Installer."]},{"entry":[{},{"@attributes":{"namest":"offset","nameend":"2","align":"center","rowsep":"1"}}]}]}}}}},{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0040","num":"0039"},"figref":"FIG. 2","b":["200","202","200","204","206"]},"At block , the procedure  determines whether a new subscription for event information has been received.

Example data elements include the available disk space, the current memory utilization, and the number of users logged into particular servers. An example correlation function that correlates two events generates an email message when two different server crashes occur within five second of one another. An example correlation function that correlates an event with data generates an event when a server crashes and the available storage space on the server's hard drive is less than five megabytes. Another example correlation function pages an administrator when the available storage space on a server's hard disk stays below ten megabytes for at least five minutes.

Thus, the administrator need not understand the complete syntax of the state machine and need not understand the programming language used to define and create the state machine.","After defining the schema for the StateA state machine, the transitions for the state machine (i.e., the transitions from one state to another) are defined by subscribing to various events. Specifically, the transition is defined by the updating consumer and the event that causes the transition is defined by the event subscription. These event subscriptions function as the transitions for the state machine. When an appropriate event occurs, the state machine transitions to the next state. The state machine transitions are defined by identifying the event that will cause the transition and identifying the action to perform based on the occurrence of the event. The action may include, for example, generating an email message, logging event data to a file, or forwarding an event to one or more destinations. The transitions are defined using updating consumer instances.","After defining the transitions for the state machine, an updating consumer is used to update the state of the state machine. The updating consumer (named \u201cupdate\u201d) is a class object. One or more instances of the updating consumer can be implemented simultaneously to handle the updating of different state machines. An example updating consumer implementation is illustrated below.\n\n","While a particular state machine is operating, the various internal states of the state machine can be obtained (e.g., queried). This allows an administrator or other user to observe the correlation as the various events occur in a system. Even if the conditions have not yet been met to generate the appropriate event, the administrator can observe the current state or value of different properties (e.g., how many crashes have occurred or how much time is left before the state machine is reset). The ability to observe the various states and properties of the state machine assists with troubleshooting and determining whether the desired correlation function has been properly established.","Various examples have been discussed herein in which two different events are correlated with one another or an event is correlated with data. However, in alternate embodiments, any number of events can be combined together to form a correlation function.

In this role, the template does not define a complete correlation scenario. A distinguishing characteristic of this type of template is that it does not define any correlation state.

Unlike a correlation helper template, a correlation scenario template is autonomous. It maintains its own correlation state and is comprised of correlation primitives, correlation helper templates, and even other correlation scenario templates. A desirable feature of the correlation scenario templates is that they can act as building blocks that a high-level user (e.g., a system administrator) can assemble to create a larger, more complex, correlation scenario template. In order to realize this goal, correlation scenario templates must be designed with well-defined characteristics that allow them to be combined in many, often unpredictable, ways.","Correlation Helper Template Design Guidelines","There are a few guidelines for developing helper correlation templates.

A condition expression is one that identifies a particular condition of the template input that is of interest to the template. An example of this might be a template which performs actions on transition into a \u2018True\u2019 and \u2018False\u2019 state. The condition describing the True state is specified by a condition expression. The template can then automatically determine the False state by performing a NOT(condition_expression).

Thus, correlation scenario templates should follow all the guidelines for designing scenarios using correlation primitives. They should also follow the guidelines for designing helper correlation templates. Design guidelines for correlation scenario templates impose even more structure than helper correlation template design so that templates can be easily composed. There are two categories of correlation scenario templates. These are ones that use events as their input (event-based) and ones that use a data set as their input (data-based).","Event-Based Correlation Scenario Templates","Event-based correlation scenario templates allow for the correlation of events. With event-driven scenarios, users are concerned with things such as how often an event occurs, if the event has occurred within a certain amount of time, etc. An important characteristic of event-driven correlation scenario templates is that they typically do not need to be initialized. An event occurs and its action is taken immediately (or soon thereafter). Typically, the user is unable to discover the state of the inputs to this scenario, since events occur instantaneously and cannot be reviewed at some later time.","Data-Based Correlation Scenario Templates","Although all correlation actions are taken as a result of some event (such as a WMI event), the input to a certain class of correlation scenario templates is better described by a data set description. Also, since data exists in the real world, part of the correlation scenario template implementation is concerned with going out and discovering the current state of the data. A data-driven correlation scenario template is concerned with things such as whether A met a particular condition for 5 minutes or what is the trend of A, etc. There are two subtypes of data-based correlation scenario templates, property-based and condition-based.","Property-Based","Property-based correlation scenario templates are concerned with a specified property of the data set. This means that the scenario will maintain some state that is related to the value of the specified property. Examples of this type of scenario are trend or average correlation templates. These scenarios would be concerned with keeping the average or trend of a specified property. Property based correlation scenario templates usually require the property be of a certain type. For example the trend or average updating consumer scenario would require the property to be one of the numeric types.","Condition-Based","A condition-based correlation scenario template is concerned with watching a specified condition. This means that the scenario will keep some state that is based on the truth value of the condition over the specified data set. Examples of this type of scenario is seeing if a certain condition holds over each element of the data set for a specified amount of time, if a certain condition holds for a specified number of elements of the data set at any given time, etc.","Correlation scenario templates formally declare their input and output using class level qualifiers.

This property is called the correlation Id property. A Correlation Id is the unique id of the state instances of a correlation scenario. This id is usually determined from the id of the data or the events that the state instances represent. The correlation Id property is the name of the property of the data or event that has a value that can be used as the correlation Id. The name of this property, as input to a correlation scenario template, helps the template implementation derive a unique id for the correlation state instances. For correlation scenario templates having multiple instances per scenario, this id will typically be the relative pathname of the data instance it represents. Some scenarios have only a single instance per scenario. In these cases, the correlation Id will most likely be the class name of the data instance(s) it is representing.","An important point about correlation Ids is that the they need to be the id of the \u2018real-world\u2019 data instance it represents. In the cases where there is a single correlation scenario template having state representing \u2018real-world\u2019 data instances, this previous statement is obvious. However, when correlation scenario templates have state that represents the data instances of other correlation scenario templates (known as \u201clayered correlation scenario templates\u201d), the correlation Ids must be that of the original \u2018real-world\u2019 data instances, not of the immediate correlation data instances. In other words, the Id of the \u2018real-world\u2019 data instance must be propagated when layering correlation scenario templates. This rule allows correlation templates to be combined later using joining correlation scenario templates.","Correlation Scenario Template Example",{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0127","num":"0139"},"tables":{"@attributes":{"id":"TABLE-US-00021","num":"00021"},"table":{"@attributes":{"frame":"none","colsep":"0","rowsep":"0","pgwide":"1"},"tgroup":[{"@attributes":{"align":"left","colsep":"0","rowsep":"0","cols":"1"},"colspec":{"@attributes":{"colname":"1","colwidth":"273pt","align":"left"}},"thead":{"row":{"entry":{"@attributes":{"namest":"1","nameend":"1","align":"center","rowsep":"1"}}}},"tbody":{"@attributes":{"valign":"top"},"row":[{"entry":"\/\/ Example classes and instances."},{"entry":"class ExampleClass"},{"entry":"{"},{"entry":"\u2003[key] string Name;"},{"entry":"\u2003boolean Prop;"},{"entry":"};"},{"entry":"instance of ExampleClass"},{"entry":"{"},{"entry":"\u2003Name = \u201cA\u201d;"},{"entry":"\u2003Prop = TRUE;"},{"entry":"};"},{"entry":"instance of ExampleClass"},{"entry":"{"},{"entry":"\u2003Name = \u201cB\u201d;"},{"entry":"\u2003Prop = FALSE;"},{"entry":"};"},{"entry":"\/\/ the correlation scenario definition"},{"entry":"[ dynamic, provider(\u201cMicrosoft WMI Transient Provider\u201d)]"},{"entry":"class ExampleCorrelationState : MSFT_CorrelationStateBase"},{"entry":"{"},{"entry":"\u2003boolean ReceivedEventA;"},{"entry":"\u2003boolean ReceivedEventB;"},{"entry":"\u2003[trns_egg_timer] uint32 Timer;"},{"entry":"};"},{"entry":"Class BothAandBEvent : MSFT_UCEventBase"},{"entry":"{"},{"entry":"\u2003string Name;"},{"entry":"};"},{"entry":"\/* the template class *\/"},{"entry":"[dynamic, provider(\u201cMicrosoft WMI Template Provider\u201d)]"},{"entry":"class SimpleCorrelationTemplate : MSFT_CorrelationScenarioTemplate"},{"entry":"{"},{"entry":"\u2003[crln_event_query] string EventQueryA;"},{"entry":"\u2003[crln_event_query] string EventQueryB;"},{"entry":"};"},{"entry":"\/* the template builders *\/"},{"entry":"instance of MSFT_TemplateBuilder"},{"entry":"{"},{"entry":"\u2003Name = \u201cInitializerUC\u201d;"},{"entry":"\u2003Template = \u201cSimpleCorrelationTemplate\u201d;"},{"entry":"\u2003Target = instance of MSFT_UpdatingConsumer"},{"entry":"\u2003{"},{"entry":"\u2003\u2003\/* this naming scheme allows a user to determine the entire"},{"entry":"ancestry of a template instance.
