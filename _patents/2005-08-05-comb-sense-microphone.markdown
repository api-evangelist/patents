title: Comb sense microphone
abstract: There is provided a rigid hinged substrate, which forms a diaphragm for miniature microphones. A series of fingers disposed radially around the perimeter of the diaphragm interacts with mating fingers disposed adjacent the diaphragm with a small gap in between. The fingers are interdigitated. The movement of the diaphragm fingers relative to the fixed fingers varies the capacitance, thereby allowing creation of an electrical signal responsive to varying sound pressure at the diaphragm. Because the fingers may be formed with great stiffness, the classic problem in typical capacitive microphones of attraction of the diaphragm to the back plate is effectively overcome. The multiple fingers allow the creation of a microphone having a high output voltage relative to conventional microphones. This yields a very low noise microphone. The diaphragm may be readily formed using well known silicon microfabrication techniques so as to reduce manufacturing costs.

As the flexible diaphragm moves relative to the back plate in response to varying sound pressure, the capacitance of the microphone varies. This variation in capacitance may be translated to an electrical signal using a number of well known techniques. One such method is shown in  which is a schematic diagram of a typical capacitor (condenser) microphone  of the prior art. A fixed back plate  is spaced apart a distance d  from a flexible diaphragm . A DC bias voltage Vb is applied across back plate  and diaphragm .","An amplifier  has an input electrically connected to diaphragm  so as to produce an output voltage Vo in response to movement of diaphragm  relative to back plate . Because the output signal Vo is proportional to bias voltage Vb, it is desirable to make Vb as high as possible so as to maximize output signal voltage Vo of microphone .","Unfortunately, the bias voltage Vb exerts an electrostatic force on diaphragm  in the direction of the back plate. This limits the practical upper limit of the bias voltage Vb. This electrostatic force, f, is given by the equation:",{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0008","num":"0007"},"maths":{"@attributes":{"id":"MATH-US-00001","num":"00001"},"math":{"@attributes":{"overflow":"scroll"},"mtable":{"mtr":{"mtd":[{"mrow":{"mi":"f","mo":"=","mrow":{"mfrac":{"mo":"\u2146","mrow":{"mo":"\u2146","mi":"x"}},"mo":"\u2062","mrow":{"mo":["(",")"],"mrow":{"mfrac":{"mn":["1","2"]},"mo":"\u2062","msubsup":{"mi":["CV","b"],"mn":"2"}}}}}},{"mrow":{"mo":["(",")"],"mn":"1"}}]}}}},"br":{}},{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0009","num":"0008"},"maths":{"@attributes":{"id":"MATH-US-00002","num":"00002"},"math":{"@attributes":{"overflow":"scroll"},"mtable":{"mtr":{"mtd":[{"mrow":{"mi":"C","mo":"=","mfrac":{"mrow":[{"mi":["\u025b","A"],"mo":["\u2062","\u2062"],"mstyle":{"mspace":{"@attributes":{"width":"0.3em","height":"0.3ex"}}}},{"mstyle":[{"mspace":{"@attributes":{"width":"0.3em","height":"0.3ex"}}},{"mspace":{"@attributes":{"width":"0.3em","height":"0.3ex"}}}],"mo":["\u2062","\u2062"],"mrow":{"mi":["d","x"],"mo":"+"}}]}}},{"mrow":{"mo":["(",")"],"mn":"2"}}]}}}},"br":{},"ul":{"@attributes":{"id":"ul0001","list-style":"none"},"li":{"@attributes":{"id":"ul0001-0001","num":"0000"},"ul":{"@attributes":{"id":"ul0002","list-style":"none"},"li":["(\u03b5=8.86\u00d710farads\/meter);","A is the area of the diaphragm  of the microphone;","d is the nominal distance  between the back plate  and the diaphragm ; and","x is the displacement of the diaphragm, a positive value indicating displacement away from the back plate ."]}}}},"Combining Equations (1) and (2) yields:",{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0011","num":"0014"},"maths":{"@attributes":{"id":"MATH-US-00003","num":"00003"},"math":{"@attributes":{"overflow":"scroll"},"mtable":{"mtr":{"mtd":[{"mrow":{"mi":"f","mo":"=","mfrac":{"mrow":[{"mrow":{"mo":"-","msubsup":{"mi":["V","b"],"mn":"2"}},"mo":["\u2062","\u2062","\u2062"],"mi":["\u025b","A"],"mstyle":{"mspace":{"@attributes":{"width":"0.3em","height":"0.3ex"}}}},{"mn":"2","mo":"\u2062","msup":{"mrow":{"mo":["(",")"],"mrow":{"mi":["d","x"],"mo":"+"}},"mn":"2"}}]}}},{"mrow":{"mo":["(",")"],"mn":"3"}}]}}}}},"It will be noted that regardless of the polarity of Vb, this electrostatic force f acts to pull diaphragm  towards back plate . If Vb is increased beyond a certain magnitude, diaphragm  collapses against back plate . In order to avoid this collapse, the diaphragm must be designed to have sufficient stiffness. Unfortunately, this requirement for diaphragm stiffness conflicts with the need for high diaphragm compliance necessary to ensure responsiveness to sound pressure.","Because in microphones of this construction, electrostatic force f does not vary linearly with x, distortion of the output signal relative to the sensed acoustic pressure typically results.","Yet another problem occurs in these types of microphones. The presence of back plate  typically causes excessive viscous damping of the diaphragm . This damping is caused by the squeezing of the air in the narrow gap  separating the back plate  and the diaphragm .","The comb sense microphone of the present invention overcomes all of these shortcomings of microphones of the prior art.","In accordance with the present invention there is provided an ultra-miniature microphone incorporating a rigid silicon resiliently supported substrate which forms a diaphragm. A series of fingers disposed around the perimeter of the diaphragm interacts with mating fingers disposed adjacent the diaphragm fingers with a small gap in between. In other words, the fingers are interdigitated. The movement of the diaphragm fingers relative to the fixed fingers varies the capacitance, thereby allowing creation of an electrical signal responsive to a varying sound pressure at the diaphragm. Because the electrostatic force on the fingers does not have a significant dependence on the out-of-plane displacement of the diaphragm, the classic problem of attraction of the diaphragm to the back plate discussed hereinabove is effectively overcome. The diaphragm can be designed to be very compliant without creating instabilities due to electrostatic forces. The multiple fingers allow creation of a microphone having a high output voltage relative to microphones of the prior art. This, in turn, allows creation of very low noise microphones.","The diaphragm is readily formed using well-known silicon microfabrication techniques to yield low manufacturing costs.","It should be noted that many capacitive sensors utilize interdigitated comb fingers. The primary uses of this sensing approach are in silicon accelerometers and gyroscopes well known to those of skill in those arts. Such sensors generally consist of a resiliently supported proof mass that moves relative to the surrounding substrate due to the motion of the substrate. An essential feature of these constructions is that the proof mass is supported only on a small fraction of its perimeter, allowing a significant portion of the perimeter to be available for capacitive detection of the relative motion of the proof mass and the surrounding substrate through the use of comb fingers. This requirement has precluded the use of comb fingers for capacitive sensing in microphones because the typical approach to the formation of a microphone diaphragm is to construct a very thin plate that is effectively clamped along its entire perimeter. Because silicon accelerometers and gyroscopes utilize compliant hinges rather than entirely clamped perimeters, they readily permit the use of comb fingers for sensing.","A highly efficient capacitance microphone that overcomes the deficiencies of classic capacitance microphones of the prior art described hereinabove may be formed by making a diaphragm having a series of fingers disposed around its perimeter. These fingers are then interdigitated with corresponding fingers on a fixed structure analogous to a back plate in microphone  ().","Referring now to , there is shown a schematic cross-sectional view of an interdigitated finger structure, generally at reference number . A series of fingers  projects from the surface of a substrate . The surface of substrate  is free to move out of the plane of the figure and forms the diaphragm of a microphone. Additional fingers  project from the surface of a fixed structure  representative of a microphone back plate. Fingers  projecting from diaphragm  are free to move with the diaphragm out of the plane of the figure as well as in the direction x indicated by arrow  relative to the fixed structure .","Referring now also to , there is shown an end view of a portion of the fingers of showing one each of fingers , . Fingers  and  are separated by a gap d . Fingers  and  may overlap one another a distance h .","Each finger ,  has a length l (not shown) in a direction perpendicular to the cross-sectional view of .
