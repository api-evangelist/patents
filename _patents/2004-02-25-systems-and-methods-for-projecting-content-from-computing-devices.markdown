The copyright owner has no objection to the facsimile reproduction by anyone of the patent document or the patent disclosure, as it appears in the Patent and Trademark Office patent files or records, but otherwise reserves all copyright rights whatsoever. The following notice shall apply to this document: Copyright \u00a9 2003, Microsoft Corp.","This invention relates to systems, methods and user interfaces for enabling wireless projection of content from a computing device to an alternate display, such as a projector.","Personal computers and portable\/mobile computing devices, such as laptop computers, Tablet computers, notebook computers, sub-notebook computers and handheld computing devices, etc., as well as other present and future variants of portable\/mobile computing devices, are sometimes used to transmit content to a third party device for manipulation or rendering. Such portable or mobile computing devices will be referred to herein simply as \u201cmobile computing devices\u201d or \u201cmobile devices\u201d without limitation. For instance, mobile devices can be used in situations, such as meetings, to display a presentation on a display, such as a large format display surface, e.g., projector or monitor, in the meeting environment. Currently, when such a situation arises, users making presentations using a mobile computer physically connect the portable\/mobile computer via a cable to the projector or to an intermediate electronic system that controls the projector. However, laptop users wanting to present in a conference room must sit close to the projector control and swap VGA, and possibly also audio cables to present. The cord is typically not long enough and causes a musical chairs effect between every presentation as people move around to get the right person close enough to plug in their laptop. A user may then have to adjust screen resolution and\/or audio settings each time a new presenter takes control of the projector display. In addition, users ideally want to project their display not just to the conference room projector but also to the laptops of various attendees in the meeting room.","The need to physically connect a cable, however, is undesirable for a variety of reasons. First, it requires a user with the mobile computing device to know that the mobile computing device can connect and also how to connect the mobile computing device, i.e., to know that their mobile computing device includes a connector or port for receiving the projector cable, and that such a connection plus some combination of obscure keystrokes (e.g., function key plus F5 key) switches the output of the portable or mobile computing device from the ordinary display of the mobile computing device to the port. Secondly, anytime one or more physical steps are introduced in a computing process, the time it takes to complete the process increases. For instance, a user must bring the mobile device to the cable, connect the cable, and secure the connection so that disconnection does not happen easily. Moreover, to the extent that male and female connector components are physical components, they are subject to abuse, and ordinary wear and tear. For instance, often the pins of a connector can become bent, damaged, metal fatigued, etc. in which case the connector components, either male or female, may no longer function properly.","In addition, the content\/data that is ultimately sent to the projector cannot be simultaneously viewed on the computers of meeting attendees. While wireless technology is rapidly gathering momentum in the marketplace, currently, there is no generic mechanism for receiving wireless data by a display, such as a projector. Moreover, there is no generic mechanism for a mobile device to wirelessly transmit content to a display, such as a projector. Still further, there is no generic mechanism for third party computing devices to receive content.","Accordingly, there is a need in the art to add wireless technology to projectors to allow easy access for mobile users, enabling the ability to bring together a plurality of mobile users into the same room for collaborative meetings and providing a seamless connection where a wired solution is not practical. Furthermore, there is a need in the art to remove issues associated with cabling, making projectors easier to install and tidier, without signal degradation over longer distances. Moreover, there is a need in the art to switch between multiple mobile device sources, for example, if multiple people are presenting from their mobile devices. It would be still further desirable to provide a mechanism and corresponding user interface to allow users to find available wireless projectors or other computers, change or enable settings and connect specified content to them. Similarly, on the receiving side, it would be desirable to include a mechanism and corresponding user interface for users of other computers to accept \u201cprojected\u201d content\/data from a source mobile computer.","In consideration of the above-identified shortcomings of the art, the present invention provides systems and methods that enable an alternate display device to wirelessly receive content from a computing device, freeing users from the burden of physically connecting the computing device via a cable. In another aspect, the content capable of being sent to the display device can also be simultaneously or separately viewed on the computing devices of other nearby computing devices. In various embodiments, the invention includes generic mechanism(s) and corresponding user interfaces for computing devices to engage in discovery of devices to which content may be delivered, for accepting delivery of the content where appropriate and for initiating transmission of content.","Other advantages and features of the invention are described below.","The invention is directed to systems and methods that enable a display device, such as a projector or large display monitor, to wirelessly receive content from a computing device, freeing users from the burden of physically connecting the computing device via a cable. In another aspect, the content capable of being sent to the display device can also be simultaneously or separately viewed on the computing devices of other nearby computing devices. In various embodiments, a projector is provided with wireless functionality, allowing computing devices to wirelessly transmit content in turn to the projector, e.g., useful for collaborative meetings and conference presentations. Since cabling issues are removed, the projector is easier to install, there is no content degradation over significant distances and switching between multiple computing device sources is facilitated. Accordingly, content presenters can be more mobile within the signaling capabilities of wireless technologies, without being tied to physical locations such as \u201cnear the projector\u201d or \u201cnear a wall socket.\u201d","The following definitions should be considered an aid in considering one or more terms utilized herein, but not intended to limit the broader meanings of any of the terms as understood by one of ordinary skill in the art.","Wi-Fi (Wireless Fidelity): Wi-Fi technology provides networking using radio technology. Wi-Fi networks operate in the unlicensed 2.4 to 5 GHz radio bands, which has the capacity to transfers data at 11 Mbps, but typically delivers 7 Mbps of real data throughput. This provides performance similar to the basic 10 Base-T wired Ethernet networks used in many offices. Alternate display devices in accordance with the invention include, but are not limited, to Wi-Fi 802.11b technology, currently the most common form of wireless communication in the projector and computer industry.","Peer-to-Peer (Ad Hoc): Wireless configuration in which one or more computers can share a projector equipped with the same wireless capability. Peer-to peer implies that each projector user has the same capabilities and each user can initiate a communication session with the projector (or theoretically each other). Ad hoc is Latin meaning \u2018for this\u2019 or \u2018for this purpose only,\u2019 implying a temporary or spontaneous arrangement, as is the case of mobile wireless computers that come and go from a presentation room. This arrangement allows equal access for all users and thus collaborative meetings or shared presentations are possible.","Alternate Display Device, or Projector Device: The projector device uses both Terminal Services and UPnP. The device exposes the methods that a MRM device uses to control the device and establish a connection via Terminal Services. This could be an actual projector or another device, such as a laptop, hooked to a projector.","RA: Remote Assistance.","Terminal Services (TS): Terminal Services is responsible for the protocol used to \u201cstream\u201d the screen of the user.","UPnP Device Host and Control Point: The Universal Plug and Play (UPnP) protocol is used for discovery of the device. In addition, the device is hosted within the UPnP Device Host service.","RDP Salem Layer: The RDP Salem Layer understands the Remote Assistance \u201ctickets\u201d used for establishing a connection.","Salem Layer for TS: Salem Layer is a current ticket generation layer for Remote Assistance.","Exemplary Networked and Distributed Environments","One of ordinary skill in the art can appreciate that the invention can be implemented in connection with any computer or other client or server device, which can be deployed as part of a computer network, or in a distributed computing environment. In this regard, the present invention pertains to any computer system or environment having any number of memory or storage units, and any number of applications and processes occurring across any number of storage units or volumes, which may be used in connection with wireless transmission of content in accordance with the present invention. The present invention may apply to an environment with server computers and client computers deployed in a network environment or distributed computing environment, having remote or local storage. The present invention may also be applied to standalone computing devices, having programming language functionality, interpretation and execution capabilities for generating, receiving and transmitting information in connection with remote or local services. With network sources for digital media proliferating more than ever, the invention is particularly relevant to those computing devices operating in a network or distributed computing environment, and thus the transmission techniques in accordance with the present invention can be applied with great efficacy in those environments.","Distributed computing provides sharing of computer resources and services by exchange between computing devices and systems. These resources and services include the exchange of information, cache storage and disk storage for files. Distributed computing takes advantage of network connectivity, allowing clients to leverage their collective power and storage to benefit the entire enterprise. In this regard, a variety of devices may have applications, objects or resources that may implicate the ability to wirelessly project content via the invention.",{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0033","num":"0032"},"figref":["FIG. 2A","FIG. 2A"],"b":["10","10","110","110","110","14","10","10","110","110","110"],"i":["a","b","a","b","c","a","b","a","b","c"]},"It can also be appreciated that an object, such as , may be hosted on another computing device , , etc. or , , etc. Thus, although the physical environment depicted may show the connected devices as computers, such illustration is merely exemplary and the physical environment may alternatively be depicted or described comprising various digital devices such as PDAs, televisions, MP3 players, etc., software objects such as interfaces, COM objects, or any device that may be utilized in connection with a media experience.","There are a variety of systems, components, and network configurations that support distributed computing environments. For example, computing systems may be connected together by wired or wireless systems, by local networks or widely distributed networks. Currently, many of the networks are coupled to the Internet, which provides an infrastructure for widely distributed computing and encompasses many different networks. Any of the infrastructures may be used for exemplary communications made incident to the provision of wireless content projection according to the present invention.","In home networking environments, there are at least four disparate network transport media that may each support a unique protocol, such as Power line, data (both wireless and wired), voice (e.g., telephone) and entertainment media. Most home control devices such as light switches and appliances may use power lines for connectivity. Data Services may enter the home as broadband (e.g., either DSL or Cable modem) and are accessible within the home using either wireless (e.g., HomeRF or 802.11B) or wired (e.g., Home PNA, Cat 5, Ethernet, even power line) connectivity. Voice traffic may enter the home either as wired (e.g., Cat 3) or wireless (e.g., cell phones) and may be distributed within the home using Cat 3 wiring. Entertainment media, or other graphical data, may enter the home either through satellite or cable and is typically distributed in the home using coaxial cable. IEEE 1394 and DVI are also digital interconnects for clusters of media devices. All of these network environments and others that may emerge as protocol standards may be interconnected to form a network, such as an intranet, that may be connected to the outside world by way of the Internet. In short, a variety of disparate sources exist for the storage and transmission of data, and consequently, moving forward, computing devices will require ways of sharing data, such as data accessed or utilized incident to program objects, which request or make use of the wireless content transmission mechanism(s) in accordance with the present invention.","The Internet commonly refers to the collection of networks and gateways that utilize the TCP\/IP suite of protocols, which are well-known in the art of computer networking. TCP\/IP is an acronym for \u201cTransmission Control Protocol\/Internet Protocol.\u201d The Internet can be described as a system of geographically distributed remote computer networks interconnected by computers executing networking protocols that allow users to interact and share information over the network(s). Because of such wide-spread information sharing, remote networks such as the Internet have thus far generally evolved into an open system for which developers can design software applications for performing specialized operations or services, essentially without restriction.","Thus, the network infrastructure enables a host of network topologies such as client\/server, peer-to-peer, or hybrid architectures. The \u201cclient\u201d is a member of a class or group that uses the services of another class or group to which it is not related. Thus, in computing, a client is a process, i.e., roughly a set of instructions or tasks, that requests a service provided by another program. The client process utilizes the requested service without having to \u201cknow\u201d any working details about the other program or the service itself. In a client\/server architecture, particularly a networked system, a client is usually a computer that accesses shared network resources provided by another computer, e.g., a server. In the example of , computers , , etc. can be thought of as clients and computers , , etc. can be thought of as the server where server , , etc. maintains the data that is then replicated in the client computers , , etc., although any computer can be considered a client, a server, or both, depending on the circumstances. For instance, computer may be a laptop, and computing devices , , etc. may be remote media devices, or alternate display devices. Any of these computing devices may be processing data or requesting services or tasks that may implicate the wireless transmission\/reception of content in accordance with the invention.","A server is typically a remote computer system accessible over a remote or local network, such as the Internet. The client process may be active in a first computer system, and the server process may be active in a second computer system, communicating with one another over a communications medium, thus providing distributed functionality and allowing multiple clients to take advantage of the information-gathering capabilities of the server. Any software objects utilized pursuant to the invention may be distributed across multiple computing devices or objects.","Client(s) and server(s) communicate with one another utilizing the functionality provided by protocol layer(s). For example, HyperText Transfer Protocol (HTTP) is a common protocol that is used in conjunction with the World Wide Web (WWW), or \u201cthe Web.\u201d For instance, remote desktop protocol (RDP) is a common protocol utilized for remote computing. Typically, a computer network address such as an Internet Protocol (IP) address or other reference such as a Universal Resource Locator (URL) can be used to identify the server or client computers to each other. The network address can be referred to as a URL address. Communication can be provided over a communications medium, e.g., client(s) and server(s) may be coupled to one another via TCP\/IP connection(s) for high-capacity communication.","Thus,  illustrates an exemplary networked or distributed environment, with a server in communication with client computers via a network\/bus, in which the present invention may be employed. In more detail, a number of servers , , etc., are interconnected via a communications network\/bus , which may be a LAN, WAN, intranet, the Internet, etc., with a number of client or remote computing devices , , , , , etc., such as a portable computer, handheld computer, thin client, networked appliance, or other device, such as a VCR, TV, oven, light, heater and the like in accordance with the present invention. It is thus contemplated that the present invention may apply to any computing device having media abilities when it comes to storage, creation, user interface, rendering, etc.","In a network environment in which the communications network\/bus  is the Internet, for example, the servers , , etc. can be Web servers with which the clients , , , , , etc. communicate via any of a number of known protocols such as HTTP. Servers , , etc. may also serve as clients , , , , , etc., as may be characteristic of a distributed computing environment.","Communications may be wired or wireless, where appropriate. Client devices , , , , , etc. may or may not communicate via communications network\/bus , and may have independent communications associated therewith. For example, in the case of a TV or VCR, there may or may not be a networked aspect to the control thereof. Each client computer , , , , , etc. and server computer , , etc. may be equipped with various application program modules or objects  and with connections or access to various types of storage elements or objects, across which files or data streams may be stored or to which portion(s) of files or data streams may be downloaded, transmitted or migrated. Any one or more of computers , , , , etc. may be responsible for the maintenance and updating of a database  or other storage element, such as a database or memory  for storing data processed according to the invention. Thus, the present invention can be utilized in a computer network environment having client computers , , etc. that can access and interact with a computer network\/bus  and server computers , , etc. that may interact with client computers , , etc. and other like devices, and databases .","Exemplary Computing Device",{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0044","num":"0043"},"figref":"FIG. 2B"},"Although not required, the invention can be implemented via an operating system, for use by a developer of services for a device or object, and\/or included within application software that operates in connection with the wireless delivery of content in accordance with the invention. Software may be described in the general context of computer-executable instructions, such as program modules, being executed by one or more computers, such as client workstations, servers or other devices. Generally, program modules include routines, programs, objects, components, data structures and the like that perform particular tasks or implement particular abstract data types. Typically, the functionality of the program modules may be combined or distributed as desired in various embodiments. Moreover, those skilled in the art will appreciate that the invention may be practiced with other computer system configurations and protocols.

The invention may also be practiced in distributed computing environments where tasks are performed by remote processing devices that are linked through a communications network\/bus or other data transmission medium. In a distributed computing environment, program modules may be located in both local and remote computer storage media including memory storage devices, and client nodes may in turn behave as server nodes.",{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0046","num":"0045"},"figref":"FIG. 2B","b":["100","100","100","100"]},"With reference to , an exemplary system for implementing the invention includes a general purpose computing device in the form of a computer .

Communication media typically embodies computer readable instructions, data structures, program modules or other data in a modulated data signal such as a carrier wave or other transport mechanism and includes any information delivery media. The term \u201cmodulated data signal\u201d means a signal that has one or more of its characteristics set or changed in such a manner as to encode information in the signal. By way of example, and not limitation, communication media includes wired media such as a wired network or direct-wired connection, and wireless media such as acoustic, RF, infrared and other wireless media. Combinations of any of the above should also be included within the scope of computer readable media.","The system memory  includes computer storage media in the form of volatile and\/or nonvolatile memory such as read only memory (ROM)  and random access memory (RAM) .

Note that these components can either be the same as or different from operating system , application programs , other program modules  and program data . Operating system , application programs , other program modules  and program data  are given different numbers here to illustrate that, at a minimum, they are different copies. A user may enter commands and information into the computer  through input devices such as a keyboard  and pointing device , commonly referred to as a mouse, trackball or touch pad. Other input devices (not shown) may include a microphone, joystick, game pad, satellite dish, scanner, or the like. These and other input devices are often connected to the processing unit  through a user input interface  that is coupled to the system bus , but may be connected by other interface and bus structures, such as a parallel port, game port or a universal serial bus (USB). A graphics interface , such as Northbridge, may also be connected to the system bus . Northbridge is a chipset that communicates with the CPU, or host processing unit , and assumes responsibility for accelerated graphics port (AGP) communications. One or more graphics processing units (GPUs)  may communicate with graphics interface . In this regard, GPUs  generally include on-chip memory storage, such as register storage and GPUs  communicate with a video memory , wherein the application variables of the invention may have impact.

A modem, which may be internal or external, may be connected to the system bus via the user input interface of input , or other appropriate mechanism. In a networked environment, program modules depicted relative to the computer , or portions thereof, may be stored in a remote memory storage device. It will be appreciated that the network connections shown and described are exemplary and other means of establishing a communications link between the computers may be used.","Exemplary Distributed Computing Frameworks or Architectures","Various distributed computing frameworks have been and are being developed in light of the convergence of personal computing and the Internet. Individuals and business users alike are provided with a seamlessly interoperable and Web-enabled interface for applications and computing devices, making computing activities increasingly Web browser or network-oriented.","For example, MICROSOFT\u00ae's managed code platform, i.e., .NET, includes servers, building-block services, such as Web-based data storage and downloadable device software. Generally speaking, the .NET platform provides (1) the ability to make the entire range of computing devices work together and to have user information automatically updated and synchronized on all of them, (2) increased interactive capability for Web pages, enabled by greater use of XML rather than HTML, (3) online services that feature customized access and delivery of products and services to the user from a central starting point for the management of various applications, such as e-mail, for example, or software, such as Office .NET, (4) centralized data storage, which increases efficiency and ease of access to information, as well as synchronization of information among users and devices, (5) the ability to integrate various communications media, such as e-mail, faxes, and telephones, (6) for developers, the ability to create reusable modules, thereby increasing productivity and reducing the number of programming errors and (7) many other cross-platform and language integration features as well.","While some exemplary embodiments herein are described in connection with software residing on a computing device, one or more portions of the invention may also be implemented via an operating system, application programming interface (API) or a \u201cmiddle man\u201d object, a control object, hardware, firmware, intermediate language instructions or objects, etc., such that the methods of the invention may be included in, supported in or accessed via all of the languages and services enabled by managed code, such as .NET code, and in other distributed computing frameworks as well.","Overview of Remote Desktop Protocol and Terminal Server Sessions","The Microsoft Remote Desktop Protocol (RDP) is one example of a protocol that can be used to port a media experience from a host to a remote media consumption device. RDP provides remote display and input capabilities over network connections for Windows-based applications running on a server. RDP is designed to support different types of network topologies and multiple LAN protocols.","On the server, RDP uses its own video driver to render display output by constructing the rendering information into network packets using the protocol and sending them over the network to the client. On the client, RDP receives rendering data and interprets the packets into corresponding graphics device interface API calls. For the input path, client mouse and keyboard events are redirected from the client to the server. On the server, RDP uses its own virtual keyboard and mouse-driver to receive the keyboard and mouse events. From a non-limiting feature standpoint, RDP includes encryption, bandwidth reduction features, roaming disconnect, clipboard mapping, print redirection, virtual channels, remote control and network load balancing.","Terminal Server provides an exemplary remote computing environment as an extension of a server, such as Windows NT Server. With merely a thin client, users can experience the server desktop operating system and applications completely off the server. With Terminal Server, users are provided access to Windows-based applications from any of the following types of desktops: (A) low-cost hardware, commonly referred to as Windows-based terminals, which are marketed by third-party hardware vendors, (B) Windows desktop operating systems, such as Windows 95 or Microsoft Windows NT Workstation by running the Terminal Server client as a window within the local desktop environment, and (C) X-based Terminals, UNIX-based desktops as well as Apple Macintosh, MS-DOS and other networked computers (through add-on software).","Terminal Server comprises three main components: the Terminal Server multiuser core, the Remote Desktop Protocol (RDP) and the thin client software.","Terminal Server is the multiuser server core that provides the ability to host multiple, simultaneous client sessions on other devices. Terminal Server is capable of directly hosting compatible multiuser client desktops running on a variety of Windows-based and non-Windows-based hardware. Standard Windows-based applications do not need modification to run on the Terminal Server, and all standard Windows NT-based management infrastructure and technologies can be used to manage the client desktops. In this way, corporations can take advantage of the rich choice of applications and tools offered by the Windows environment.","RDP is the protocol of Terminal Server that allows a thin client to communicate with the Terminal Server over the network. This protocol is based on the International Telecommunications Union (ITU) T.120 protocol, an international, standard multichannel conferencing protocol. RDP is tuned for high-bandwidth enterprise environments and also supports encrypted sessions.","The thin client component is software that presents, or displays, a Windows user interface on a range of desktop hardware including Windows-based terminal devices and personal computers.","An Object Manager of Terminal Server provides that applications and system programs of different sessions do not collide. Every object name created within a session is appended with a unique identifier number associated with the individual session that created it (SessionID). The Terminal Server service is entirely protocol-independent, so it can function using RDP or a third-party add-on protocol such as Citrix's ICA.","RDP is a multichannel capable protocol allowing for separate virtual channels for carrying serial device communication and presentation data from the server, as well as encrypted client mouse and keyboard data. Virtual channels are software extensions that can be used to add functional enhancements to a Terminal Services application. Examples of functional enhancements might include: support for special types of hardware, audio, or other additions to the core functionality provided by the Terminal Services RDP. RDP provides multiplexed management of multiple virtual channels.","A virtual channel application has two parts, a client-side component and a server-side component. The server-side component is an executable program running on the Terminal Server. The client-side component is a DLL that is loaded into memory on the client computer when the Terminal Services client program runs.","Virtual channels can add functional enhancements to a Terminal Services client, independent of the RDP protocol. With virtual channel support, new features can be added without having to update the client or server software, or the RDP protocol.","Several other capabilities are also part of the T.120 standards definition, including, for example, multipoint data delivery, which allows data from an application to be delivered \u201creal-time\u201d to multiple parties. Multicast-enabled delivery allows for reliable delivery services of data transmissions. It increases the performance for the customer while at the same time reducing the load on the network infrastructure. RDP is beneficial for connectivity purposes because it provides an extensible base from which to build more abilities. This is in part because RDP provides up to 64,000 separate channels for data transmission, as well as provisions for multipoint transmission.","RDP is designed to support many different types of Network topologies, such as ISDN, POTS, and many LAN protocols, such as IPX, Netbios, TCP\/IP, and so forth.","The activity involved in sending and receiving data through the RDP stack is essentially the same as the seven-layer OSI (open systems interconnection) model standards for common LAN networking today. Data from an application or service to be transmitted is passed down through the protocol stacks, sectioned, directed to a channel, encrypted, wrapped, framed, packaged onto the network protocol, and finally addressed and sent over the wire to the client.","The return data works the same way in reverse, with the packet being stripped of its address, then unwrapped, decrypted, and so on, until the data is presented to the application for use. Some portions of the protocol stack modifications occur between the 4th and 7th layers, where the data is encrypted, wrapped and framed, directed to a channel, and prioritized.","With RDP, advantageously, the complexities of dealing with the Protocol stack are abstracted away from the application developer. The application developer simply writes the application, and the RDP stack implemented by the Terminal Server and its client connections takes care of the rest.","When starting, Terminal Server boots and loads the core operating system, and the Terminal Server service is started and begins waiting for session connections. Each connection is given a unique session identifier or \u201cSessionID,\u201d to represent an individual session to the Terminal Server and each process created within a session is \u201ctagged\u201d with the associated SessionID to differentiate its namespace from other session namespaces. When a user logs on to a Terminal Services-enabled computer, a session is started for the user, identified by unique session ID. Because each logon to a Terminal Services client receives a separate session ID, the user-experience is similar to being logged on to multiple computers at the same time, e.g., an office computer and a home computer.","The console (Terminal Server keyboard, mouse, and video) session is the first to load and is treated as a special-case client connection and assigned SessionID0. The console session starts as a normal system session, with the configured display, mouse, and keyboard drivers loaded.","After creating the console session, the Terminal Server service then calls the Session Manager to create two (by default) idle client sessions awaiting client connections. To create the idle sessions, the Session Manager executes the client server run-time subsystem process, and a new SessionID is assigned to that process.","Unlike the console session, client sessions are configured to load separate drivers for the display, keyboard, and mouse. The new display driver is the Remote Desktop Protocol (RDP) display device driver, and the mouse and keyboard drivers are replaced with the RDP driver. These drivers allow the RDP client session to be both available and interactive, remotely. Finally, Terminal Server also invokes a connection listener thread for the RDP protocol, which listens for RDP client connections on a TCP port. Processes with different SessionIDs are prevented from accessing another session's data.","In an exemplary implementation, the client initiates a connection to the Terminal Server through the TCP port. The Terminal Server RDP listener thread detects the session request and creates a new RDP stack instance to handle the new session request. The listener thread hands over the incoming session to the new RDP stack instance and continues listening on the TCP port for further connection attempts. Each RDP stack is created as the client sessions are connected to handle negotiation of session configuration details.","After user logon, the desktop, or application, if in single application mode, is displayed for the user. When the user selects an application to run, the mouse commands are passed to the Terminal Server, which launches the selected application into a new virtual memory space.","If a user decides to disconnect the session, the processes and all virtual memory space remain and are paged off to the physical disk if physical memory is required for other processes. An additional benefit of RDP is that of being able to change session screen resolutions, depending on what the user requests for the session. For example, if a user had previously connected to a Terminal Server session at 800\u00d7600 resolution and disconnected, and then moved to a different computer that only supported 640\u00d7480 resolution and reconnected to the existing session, the desktop would be redrawn to support the new resolution.","Logoff is typically very simple to implement. Once a user logs off from the session, all processes associated with the SessionID are terminated and any memory allocated to the session is released.","Systems and Methods for Wirelessly Transmitting and Receiving Content","In one aspect, the invention enables a display device, such as a projector or large display monitor, to include wireless technology, allowing the display device to receive content\/data from a mobile computing device. Thus, users can need not physically connect the mobile device to a cable. In another aspect, the content\/data that is being sent to the display device from a mobile device can be simultaneously viewed on the computing devices of meeting attendees. Wireless technology is rapidly gathering momentum in the projector marketplace. With a projector manufactured with wireless functionality, such as Wi-Fi, in \u201cad-hoc\u201d mode, projectors allow easy access for mobile users to provide content. Such a projector provides the ability to bring together a plurality of mobile users into the same room, or room(s) near enough for wireless technology, for collaborative meetings. Additionally, the invention provides an easy connection where a wired solution is not practical, i.e., cabling issues are removed.","Thus, with the invention, a projector is easier to install, tidier and there is no signal loss or degradation over significant distances. With the invention, it is also easier to switch between multiple PC sources, for instance, if there are multiple people presenting from their own laptops. Accordingly, presenters can be more mobile in the room, or otherwise within the capabilities of wireless technologies, and they do not have to be near the projector or near a wall socket. In one embodiment of the invention, by including wireless technology, such as Wi-Fi, capable of projecting to a projector or other mobile device in the operating system of a mobile device, the mobile device is able to project wirelessly without the need for additional installation of software or hardware to the mobile device.","In one embodiment, the invention leverages wireless technology built into projectors and uses Universal Plug and Play (UPnP) to advertise the projector's presence, users portable\/mobile computer to find, and control the projectors. The invention can utilize a Terminal Service session to connect the display to the user's machine.","The invention facilitates a great integrated experience between portable\/mobile computer drives projectors and the displays of other portable\/mobile computers. Adding wireless capability to projectors allows easy access for mobile users, providing the ability to bring together a number of mobile users into the same room for collaborative meetings, and providing an easy connection where a wired solution is not practical. Cabling issues are removed, therefore the projector is easier to install, tidier, and there is no signal loss over longer distances. It is much easier to switch between multiple PC sources, especially if multiple people are presenting from their own laptops and presenters can be more mobile in the room\u2014they do not have to be near the projector or near a wall socket.","One of the main benefits of wireless technology in accordance with the invention can be seen in a room with multiple presenters, where each speaker previously had to plug their laptop into a projector connection and unplug it when each was finished, i.e., with the invention, collaborative group presentations can be achieved without switching cables. Three scenarios enabled by the invention include Mirror, Extended Monitor and 1:N. In an exemplary Mirror scenario, Melissa walks into a conference room and sets her laptop in meeting mode. Her machine discovers the projector in the conference room. She wirelessly projects the slide show on her laptop as-is on the projector. After she is done presenting her slides, she disconnects from the projector for another meeting attendee to use the projector. Many examples are given herein, none of which should be considered limiting on the invention. For instance, the Extended scenario can be achieved in either of the 1:1 or 1:n projection circumstances. The Mirror scenario can also be achieved in the 1:1 and 1:n projection circumstance, i.e., they are not exclusive scenarios.","In a typical Extended Monitor scenario, Patrick sets his laptop in the meeting mode as he enters the client's conference room. His machine discovers the wireless projector in the room. By enabling the projector to be used in an extended multi-monitor fashion, the projector projects the presentation, while Patrick's laptop shows his notes. Effectively, Patrick's display is disaggregated so it can be used as a second monitor.","In a typical 1:N scenario, Fred meets his colleagues at the airport lobby who all have laptops, or other computing devices, that include software according to the invention, e.g., in the operating system, or as an application. As a result, Fred can easily project his slides on all his colleagues' laptops, and\/or a projector, if one is available.","Thus, the solution of the invention represents a simple user interface (UI) that allows users to find available wireless projectors or other computers, make settings and connect to them. In addition, the invention includes a UI for the users of other computers to accept \u201cprojected\u201d content\/data from the source portable\/mobile computer.",{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0099","num":"0098"},"figref":["FIG. 3","FIG. 3"],"b":["300","310","320","330","300","310","340","350"]},"Although the discovery process may return all projectors and laptops, some may not be available for display, i.e., currently in use by another projection. In accordance with the invention, these include an indication that they are in use, e.g., these are grayed out in the display with a \u201cbusy\u201d icon. As part of this dialog box, the user has the option to select from the Most Recently Used (MRU) projector list or to enter the name of the projector directly, which may include specifying a URL or IP address, without the need to discover the projector. The user is also presented with the option to configure the projection.","Once the an alternate display, e.g., projector, has been selected, projection may begin. If available, a UI element, e.g., portion of the top level or easy to reach UI, such as a sidebar, allows the user to: disconnect and\/or add more people to the projection. For instance, in one embodiment, a flyout portion of the top level or easy to reach UI, such as a sidebar, allows a user to see who is in the presentation, and to potentially disconnect them, but not to add more. In this embodiment, if a user wants to be added, the user selects a presentation via the meeting name\/password to join. A dialog box, e.g., display sidebar, thus shows status of projection, ability to disconnect and add more people to the projection list.","The architecture of the invention is illustrated in . Conference room projector technology in accordance with the invention combines two key technologies: UPnP and Terminal Services.

The API also provides a way to invite and un-invite clients into the shadowing session. The purpose of the user control point is to display a list of available alternate display device from which the user can select for connection.","As described above, the invention provides the ability to discover a conference room projector in a wireless setting, the ability to project a laptop display on a projector (mirror 1:1), the ability to project a laptop display on projector and\/or to meeting attendees (1:m), even in the absence of a WinCE based projector and the ability to have speaker notes on the laptop as well as slide show on the projector (extended multi-mon). As mentioned, the invention also provides User Interface(s) for ease of user interaction for projection and aspects of the user interface mechanism(s) are now described in more detail.","In accordance with the invention, the user has the option to configure the projection.

For instance, if Robert has mobility impairment and does not have motor control below the neck, Robert probably uses an on-screen keyboard with an electronic pointing device to achieve his computing objectives, i.e., he is able to use the keyboard shortcuts, larger fonts to select projector displays. In one embodiment of the invention, therefore, the output of a projection can be read via a screen reader. Thus, Robert is provided with keyboard access to all features, especially mouse-intensive actions, e.g., selecting projectors and laptop displays according to the invention. Keyboard accelerators (e.g., key shortcuts) are also provided to menu items and controls.

Images are drawn using standard foreground and background colors. Also, when the high contrast flag is set via the Accessibility Control Panel, bitmapped images or other complex backgrounds behind text and controls are omitted, images are drawn in monochrome instead of multiple colors, and application-specific colors are replaced with standard system colors defined through Control Panel, with the fewest possible color combinations used. Objects are drawn using the sizes (i.e., screen metrics) selected in Control Panel. Also, if lines are drawn, the proper width is determined rather than using a fixed value. Moreover, in various embodiments, any custom controls include active accessibility properties.","Distance and obstructions can degrade wireless performance. Thus, in various embodiments of the invention, an icon is displayed via the UI mechanism(s) of the invention that indicates the signal quality. A predetermined number of levels of signal quality can be shown corresponding to obstructions, distance and data rate to be maintained.","The invention may also be combined with international language and multilingual user interface (MUI) techniques such that the content, when delivered to a device owned by a foreign user, optionally will be displayed according to the language of the foreign user.","The projection of the invention, based on the presence on IP network, can be either wired or wireless. For instance, in a wired case, Joseph is in his office (wired) and wants to project a slide deck to a guest in his office, who has a laptop (connected either wired or wirelessly). It is noted that the invention applies to any computing device, PC or otherwise, not just mobile devices.","In various embodiments, 1:1 projection includes discovery, connection to the alternate display device and transmission of data. Discovery can be user initiated or can be automatic in the background while the user is doing some task, or the system is idle, etc. 1:1 projection can be either extended or mirrored. In the extended case, there is a UI to enable one to navigate the presentation on the alternate display. For instance, one may have a PowerPoint presentation being presented on a projector and one wants to go to the next slide while having speaker notes on the laptop screen. In this case, one can use a UI on the laptop screen to highlight something on the slide or go to the next slide. Accordingly, the invention contemplates the scenario where there may be some portion of the sender's display (e.g., notes) that the sender does not wish to be seen on the rendering side, and also contemplates the scenario where there may be some portion of the sender's display not part of the rendering side as part of the ordinary projection of data, but which is added to the projection so that it is apparent on the rendering side.","In various embodiments, 1:n projection includes notification to the network of an ongoing presentation. Rules can also be associated with the presentation, which are modifiable\/expandable. Examples of rules include: (A) People who can join\/view the presentation, (B) Password or any other authentication of the presentation, (C) Annotation of the presentation on the viewer side and\/or recordation\/storage of the annotations and (D) Enforcement of Content Rights Management rules, e.g., the ability to enforce not taking a Print Screen of the slide.","Projection also includes the ability to broadcast the presence of a presentation on the network, but not to the people who are actually on the network. Non UPnP based discovery can also be achieved in alternate embodiments. While discovery can be achieved via IP as described above, discovery can be achieved by means of any protocol, i.e., a machine can be pinged directly to see if a presentation is occurring.","As part of the user experience, in one embodiment, users can enter a \u201cView Presentation\u201d mode and see a list of presentations going on throughout the network. A receiver could also receive notifications relating to a presentation, e.g., a notification that a presentation is nearby or that someone specifically wishes to present to you.","The invention also includes the ability to transfer control of a presentation to another connected user, whereby any user can transfer control of the presentation to another person. As alluded to above, there can be administrative rights assigned by the person who owns the presentation as to who can receive control of the presentation, and what level of control, etc. The user experience that exposes the list of people currently viewing the presentation includes the ability to add or remove someone, if authorized. The invention also contemplates the ability to attend multiple presentations simultaneously with varying degrees of control, i.e., rules can be assigned per presentation.","The invention also includes the ability to combine 1:1 and 1:n projection scenarios, where possible. Since alternate display devices, such as a projector, can have a queue of devices wanting to use the alternate display device for their respective presentations, the invention includes a mechanism to manage the queuing of presentations by devices. Ability for any application to start a mode in the presentation i.e. view or start a new presentation.","As mentioned, the invention includes the ability to configure what is actually presented, i.e., audio and video, audio only, or video only. In one embodiment, the invention also includes \u201cLaser Pointer\u201d functionality, i.e., a user can temporarily highlight something in an ongoing presentation during the presentation via an auxiliary input mechanism corresponding to an auxiliary display effect, such as \u201claser pointing.\u201d For instance, mouse movements may be converted to a mimic a laser pointer with trail.","In further embodiments, the invention provides systems and methods for controlling remote presentation of content with public and private aspects. In this regard, the invention distinguishes between public content of a presentation that is meant to be sent (i.e., remoted, broadcast or otherwise transmitted) to client devices (other laptops, projector, etc.) for display, and private content of a presentation that is meant to preserve its functionality, e.g., be displayed, on the server computing device from which the public content is being remoted. In one embodiment of the user interface of the invention, by default, content generated or altered previous to or concurrent with a publishing act, such as \u201cprinting\u201d to the journal in the TabletPC context, is public content, and alterations (e.g., annotations, highlighting, other additions, masking of public content, deletions, etc.) to the content made after the publishing act form the basis for private content. In another embodiment of the user interface of the invention, a user can take some action with respect to content, and designate some or all of the resulting content added, masked or removed by the action to be private. Consequently, during a content remoting experience, client devices display only the public content, while the private content remains for display at the server device.","Advantageously, the presentation including the private content at the server device remains synchronized with the display of the client devices, e.g., when a slideshow is being rendered, a change of slide at the server device correspondingly changes the slide at the client devices. Also of advantage, the presenter is able to control the display of the static public content sent to the client device(s) via the user interface mechanism of the invention, while retaining the ability to view the private content on the server computing device (e.g., by inputting page up\/page down or other similar commands for a PowerPoint slideshow).","In this regard, when presenting content using software, such as PowerPoint, Journal, Excel, Word, XML, HTML, etc., the presenter typically has his or her back to the screen. For example, it can be cumbersome to ensure that the audience is looking at the same material the presenter is speaking about, requiring the speaker to ask another person to advance the public slide deck, or, if the speaker is advancing the deck, the speaker must occasionally glance back at the screen to ensure the deck is in the right spot, which can disrupt the flow of the presentation. The invention thus remotely advances the public presentation of the deck as the speaker advances his\/her private presentation on the computer. Accordingly, the invention advantageously enables the speaker to annotate a copy of the deck using the capabilities of the computer, but when displayed to the public, only the \u201cpublic\u201d portions of the deck are displayed\u2014private annotations are hidden from public view. For example, the speaker can annotate each presentation slide with ink indicating points he or she wants to emphasize or with additional talking points. When that slide deck is then displayed (under control of the speaker's computing device), the remote control aspect of the invention ensures that public is looking at the same slide as shown on the speaker's PC while the public-private aspect of the invention hides the private annotations\/alterations so that only the public portions of the deck are displayed.","An exemplary slide  of a slideshow is illustrated in . Exemplary public content  of the slideshow includes an \u201cAgenda\u201d heading and various talking points including \u201cIntroduction,\u201d \u201cCurrent Status,\u201d \u201cOptions for Consideration\u201d and \u201cNext Steps.\u201d As with other embodiments described herein, the presently described embodiments also enable the extension of content  from a computing device in the context of a presentation to a group of people, whether they are in the same room or remotely dispersed. In one embodiment, a stylus type computing device, such as the TabletPC, is considered. For instance, stylus type computing devices are great tools for annotating documents, such as a slideshow presentation. Thus, as illustrated in , slide  including public content  may be annotated with speaker notes, drawings, video, photos, text or the like. As a non-limiting example, annotations  give cues to the speaker delivering the slideshow of things to address during delivery of the slide . For another non-limiting example, part of the slide  may be highlighted with highlighting . In each of these cases, the speaker may wish only to remote the public content . Accordingly, in accordance with the invention, in conjunction with performing an action, such as annotating or highlighting, that alters the content, an author may designate the results of the action to be private content such that the private content will only be (optionally) displayed on the server device from which the public content  is being remoted to client devices. As mentioned above, default behavior may also specify which content is public and which content is private. For instance, once the content of a TabletPC is published to the Journal, the content comprises the public content whereas, by default, subsequent alterations to the content may be considered private. Thus, when the content (public and private) of  is remoted to client devices, e.g., other laptops, projectors, etc., the client devices receive the view illustrated in .","In another similar scenario illustrated in , an author may want to remove or mask detail from the public content , e.g., to abstract away from the detail of the presentation. For instance, public content  may include video, a photo or the like that the speaker would find distracting during delivery of the presentation. Accordingly, as illustrated in , an author may delete, or otherwise screen or mask, some of public content , and designate the erasure\/masking  as private, so that when the content (public and private) of  is remoted to client devices, the client devices receive the view illustrated in , whereas the server device will display the view of . Optionally, the presenter may turn the private\/public distinction off, whereby client devices will also receive the private content. Also, the presenter may also choose to view only the public content (or only the private content).","Thus, the invention can be implemented in the context of a document to be transmitted to alternate display devices, wherein the document can be considered to be two versions, i.e., a first version of the document that is public and a second version (different in some manner than the first version) that includes private content, wherein the private content is represented by the delta between the first and second versions (either additions or deletions). As mentioned, while the invention is not limited thereto, stylus computing devices, such as TabletPC provide an exemplary environment for implementation of the invention. For instance, TabletPC includes the ability to import files into a Journal (first version) whereby thereafter, the tablet pen can be used to annotate or otherwise alter the document images (second version). Files are imported into the Journal by \u201cprinting\u201d them to the Journal. Reports, forms, presentations, spreadsheets, graphics, photos, Web pages, etc. can all be imported into the Journal. In this regard, if the document can be printed, it can be imported into the Journal and annotated without changing any of the original content of the imported file. For instance, if one is en route to a meeting, one can import the meeting agenda, (e.g., a portable document format (pdf) file, word processing document, spreadsheet, slideshow file, email file, etc.) into Journal. Then, using the tablet pen, notes can be taken on the agenda of items being addressed. One's impressions of the document can thus be simply recorded and viewed. For example, one can project the content of the Tablet PC to the large-screen monitor in the conference room, import an image of the document into Journal and\/or start putting comments on the document image.","The Journal writer is a virtual printer that manages the import of document images into Journal notes. Any program that lets you print can thus send the document to the Journal writer just as it would when printing to a physical printer. The Journal can then convert the document into a document image that is used as the background for a Journal note. In Journal, a document image can be created in at least three ways: by using the print command of a different program (useful if the file is open in another program), by using the Journal Import command (useful if you are working in Journal and want to import a file) and\/or by using the drag-and-drop feature of search software such as Windows Explorer (useful for dragging a file directly into the Journal). Any file imported into Journal is imported into a new note as a set of background images. The contents of these background images cannot be changed in Journal, and accordingly, these background images are suited to being the public content of the presentation sent to alternate display devices in accordance with the invention.","There are multiple ways of implementing the present invention, e.g., an appropriate API, tool kit, driver code, operating system, control, standalone or downloadable software object, etc. which enables applications and services to use the wireless projection systems and methods of the invention. The invention contemplates the use of the invention from the standpoint of an API (or other software object), as well as from a software or hardware object that receives content and\/or makes requests according to device discovery and content acceptance and delivery protocols in accordance with the invention. Thus, various implementations of the invention described herein may have aspects that are wholly in hardware, partly in hardware and partly in software, as well as in software.","As mentioned above, while exemplary embodiments of the present invention have been described in connection with various computing devices and network architectures, the underlying concepts may be applied to any computing device or system in which it is desirable to project content to another device or receive projected content from another device. For instance, the algorithm(s) and hardware implementations of the invention may be applied to the operating system of a computing device, provided as a separate object on the device, as part of another object, as a reusable control, as a downloadable object from a server, as a \u201cmiddle man\u201d between a device or object and the network, as a distributed object, as hardware, in memory, a combination of any of the foregoing, etc. While exemplary programming languages, names and examples are chosen herein as representative of various choices, these languages, names and examples are not intended to be limiting. One of ordinary skill in the art will appreciate that there are numerous ways of providing object code and nomenclature that achieves the same, similar or equivalent functionality achieved by the various embodiments of the invention.","As mentioned, the various techniques described herein may be implemented in connection with hardware or software or, where appropriate, with a combination of both. Thus, the methods and apparatus of the present invention, or certain aspects or portions thereof, may take the form of program code (i.e., instructions) embodied in tangible media, such as floppy diskettes, CD-ROMs, hard drives, or any other machine-readable storage medium, wherein, when the program code is loaded into and executed by a machine, such as a computer, the machine becomes an apparatus for practicing the invention. In the case of program code execution on programmable computers, the computing device generally includes a processor, a storage medium readable by the processor (including volatile and non-volatile memory and\/or storage elements), at least one input device, and at least one output device. One or more programs that may implement or utilize the wireless content projection techniques of the present invention, e.g., through the use of a data processing API, reusable controls, or the like, are preferably implemented in a high level procedural or object oriented programming language to communicate with a computer system. However, the program(s) can be implemented in assembly or machine language, if desired. In any case, the language may be a compiled or interpreted language, and combined with hardware implementations.","The methods and apparatus of the present invention may also be practiced via communications embodied in the form of program code that is transmitted over some transmission medium, such as over electrical wiring or cabling, through fiber optics, or via any other form of transmission, wherein, when the program code is received and loaded into and executed by a machine, such as an EPROM, a gate array, a programmable logic device (PLD), a client computer, etc., the machine becomes an apparatus for practicing the invention. When implemented on a general-purpose processor, the program code combines with the processor to provide a unique apparatus that operates to invoke the functionality of the present invention. Additionally, any storage techniques used in connection with the present invention may invariably be a combination of hardware and software.","While the present invention has been described in connection with the preferred embodiments of the various figures, it is to be understood that other similar embodiments may be used or modifications and additions may be made to the described embodiment for performing the same function of the present invention without deviating therefrom. For example, while exemplary network environments of the invention are described in the context of a networked environment, such as a peer to peer networked environment, one skilled in the art will recognize that the present invention is not limited thereto, and that the methods, as described in the present application may apply to any computing device or environment, such as a gaming console, handheld computer, portable computer, etc., whether wired or wireless, and may be applied to any number of such computing devices connected via a communications network, and interacting across the network. Furthermore, it should be emphasized that a variety of computer platforms, including handheld device operating systems and other application specific operating systems are contemplated, especially as the number of wireless networked devices continues to proliferate.","While exemplary embodiments refer to utilizing the present invention in the context of laptops and projectors, the invention is not so limited, but rather may be implemented to provide wireless delivery of content from any one computing device including the functionality of the invention to one or more other computing devices also including functionality according to the invention. Moreover, the source computing device need not even independently have a display. For instance, with a mobile storage device with minimal processing resources, content may be delivered from the mobile storage device to an alternate display device according to the invention without independent display capabilities. Still further, the present invention may be implemented in or across a plurality of processing chips or devices, and storage may similarly be effected across a plurality of devices. Therefore, the present invention should not be limited to any single embodiment, but rather should be construed in breadth and scope in accordance with the appended claims."],"BRFSUM":[{},{}],"brief-description-of-drawings":[{},{}],"description-of-drawings":{"heading":"BRIEF DESCRIPTION OF THE DRAWINGS","p":["The systems and methods for wirelessly projecting content in accordance with the present invention are further described with reference to the accompanying drawings in which:",{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0012","num":"0011"},"figref":"FIG. 1"},{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0013","num":"0012"},"figref":"FIG. 2A"},{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0014","num":"0013"},"figref":"FIGS. 2B and 2C"},{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0015","num":"0014"},"figref":"FIG. 3"},{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0016","num":"0015"},"figref":"FIGS. 4A and 4B"},{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0017","num":"0016"},"figref":"FIG. 5"},{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0018","num":"0017"},"figref":"FIG. 6"},{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0019","num":"0018"},"figref":"FIGS. 7A-7H"},{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0020","num":"0019"},"figref":"FIGS. 8A-8C"}]},"DETDESC":[{},{}]}
