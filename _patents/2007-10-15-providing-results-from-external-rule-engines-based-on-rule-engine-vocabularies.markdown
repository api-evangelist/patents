{"@attributes":{"id":"description"},"BRFSUM":[{},{}],"heading":["FIELD","BACKGROUND","SUMMARY","DETAILED DESCRIPTION"],"p":["The present disclosure generally relates to process modeling.","A rule engine allows the execution logic of a process to be modeled in a straightforward and declarative manner. For example, a business rule engine processes the execution logic of a business process. In order to achieve higher agility and flexibility, business rule management systems (BRMSs) separate business-related application logic from other types of application logic, so that changes to business process models are easier to implement and do not necessarily require specialized programming skills. These BRMSs are used, for example, in public sector, financial, and insurance contexts.","In order to exchange data with an external rule engine, a local rule engine exchanges a vocabulary (referred to as a business vocabulary (BV), a rule engine vocabulary, or an intermediate vocabulary) with the external rule engine, where the vocabulary provides the format, type, description or structure of the data to be exchanged between the local and external rule engines. The vocabulary is used by the external rule engine to define rules, such that contexts received by the external rule engine are appropriately processed, and responses are properly formatted and structured for receipt by the local rule engine.","According to one general implementation, a BV including a context description and a result description that respectively define an input to and an output of an external business rule engine is automatically generated based on using generic data structures, where the context description further includes a context data type that is native to the external business rule engine, An expression including a connection to the external business rule engine is defined, and the BV is serialized in an eXtensible Markup Language (XML) schema document (XSD) that, when received at the external business rule engine, allows a business rule to be defined based on the context description and the result description. The schema document is transmitted via the connection to the external business rule engine using a remote procedure call, and a context specified according to the context description is passed to the expression. The context is transmitted via the connection as the input to the external business rule engine, for evaluation by the business rule, a business rule-evaluated result specified according to the result description is received via the connection as the output of the external business rule engine, and the result is output.","According to another general implementation, a method includes outputting a rule-evaluated result received from an external rule engine based on a context transmitted to the external rule engine for evaluation by the rule and on a schema document serializing an automatically generated vocabulary transmitted to the external rule engine. The schema document defines the business rule based on a context description and a result description included in the vocabulary, and the context and the result are respectively specified according to the context description and the result description.","According to another general implementation, a rule engine vocabulary including a context description and a result description that respectively define an input to and an output of an external rule engine is automatically generated, the rule engine vocabulary is serialized in a schema document that, when received at the external rule engine, allows a rule to be defined based on the context description and the result description, and the schema document is transmitted to the external rule engine. A context specified according to the context description is transmitted as the input to the external rule engine, for evaluation by the rule, a rule-evaluated result specified according to the result description is received as the output of the external rule engine, and the result is output.","Implementations may include one or more of the following features. For instance, the rule engine vocabulary may be generated based on using generic data structures, such as a field, structure, or table data element. An expression including a connection to the external rule engine may be defined, and the context may be passed to the expression, thereby causing the schema document and the context to be transmitted via the connection, and the result to be received via the connection. Defining the expression may further include querying the rule engine to determine connection parameters, and selecting the defined expression from a list of possible expressions based on the determined connection parameters. The context may be automatically transmitted to the external rule engine via a remote procedure call, if the expression is triggered. The result is received via the remote procedure call, such as a SUN MICROSYSTEMS\u00ae JAVA\u00ae programming language remote procedure call.","In further examples, the context description may further include a context data type that is native to the external rule engine. The rule may be defined at the external rule engine based on the context description and the result description. The schema document may be an XSD. The external rule engine may be a business rule engine such as a BRMS, the rule engine vocabulary may be a BV, and the external rule engine may be a business rule engine.","According to another general implementation, a computer program product is tangibly embodied in a machine-readable medium. The computer program product includes instructions that, when read by a machine, operate to cause a data processing apparatus to automatically generate a rule engine vocabulary including a context description and a result description that respectively define an input to and an output of an external rule engine, to serialize the rule engine vocabulary in a schema document that, when received at the external rule engine, allows a rule to be defined based on the context description and the result description, and to transmit the schema document to the external rule engine. The computer program product also includes instructions that, when read by a machine, operate to cause a data processing apparatus to transmit a context specified according to the context description as the input to the external rule engine, for evaluation by the rule, to receive a rule-evaluated result specified according to the result description as the output of the external rule engine, and to output the result.","According to another general implementation, a device includes a processor, an interface, and an output module. The processor automatically generates a rule engine vocabulary including a context description and a result description that respectively define an input to and an output of an external rule engine, and serializes the rule engine vocabulary in a schema document that, when received at the external rule engine, allows a rule to be defined based on the context description and the result description. The interface transmits the schema document to the external rule engine, transmits a context specified according to the context description as the input to the external rule engine, for evaluation by the rule, and receives a rule-evaluated result specified according to the result description as the output of the external rule engine. The output module outputs the result.","The details of one or more implementations are set forth in the accompanying drawings and the description, below. Other features and advantages of the disclosure will be apparent from the description and drawings, and from the claims.","Like reference numbers represent corresponding parts throughout.","A business process is a series of business tasks or activities executed in a coordinated order. Applications allow business processes that span multiple functional areas to be modeled using business objects and functions that are processed by a local business rule engine.","A task is the atomic business process component that describes an activity or alters a business process's control flow, for instance by splitting or joining the business process flow. An exemplary business process may include a dedicated begin task, and sequentially executed first through third tasks that each occur prior to the dedicated end task. The execution of certain tasks may require the invocation of an external business rule engine that provides partner-supplied functionalities or logic.","Under these circumstances, the local business rule engine (also referred to herein as a primary or proprietary business rule engine, or a \u2018Function & Derivation Tool\u2019 (FDT)) may be integrated with external or third party business rule engines (or third party BRMSs). For instance, an entity may wish to access a pre-configured third party payroll accounting rule set that is provided or optimized for a specific platform or application. By describing these other business rule engines as \u2018external,\u2019 it is merely intended that these engines are distinct from the primary or local business rule engine. Thus, a business rule engine may be referred to as \u2018external\u2019 even if it is executing on the same machine as the local business rule engine, or is associated with the same operator as the local business rule engine.","In order to exchange data with the external rule engine, the local rule engine first exchanges a vocabulary with the external rule engine, where the vocabulary provides the format, type, description or structure of the data to be exchanged between the local and external rule engines. The vocabulary allows, causes or effects the definition of rules at the external rule engine, such that input data (or \u2018contexts\u2019) received by the external rule engine is appropriately processed, and output data (or \u2018responses\u2019) are properly formatted and structured for the local rule engine. Based on this vocabulary exchange, rule-evaluated result data may be easily imported by the local rule engine and processed further.","The vocabulary is automatically generated at the local rule engine during a design time phase, using context and result information. During a runtime phase (i.e. after the deployment or definition of the rule at the external rule engine), the local rule engine may invoke the deployed rule at the external rule engine by passing data (i.e. the context) to the external rule engine. Using the rule that was defined based on the expected context format, type, description or structure, the external rule engine receives and processes the context using the rule, and returns a resulting data set to the local rule engine, in the appropriate format.","In doing so, a business entity is better able to fulfill customer requirements, particularly in the public sector, insurance, and finance fields. Furthermore, functional gaps of local rule engines are filled, since leading BRMSs which utilize proprietary or specialized rule engines may still be used by the local rule engines. Thus, the user is not committed to a particular FDT, and is offered a best-of-breed approach to modeling business processes, thereby enhancing the overall customer experience. From the perspective of the FDT producer, seamless integration of third party rule engines may improve their market position as well, since BRMS providers may tailor their own products to enhance existing FDT solutions.",{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0030","num":"0029"},"figref":"FIG. 1","b":["100","100","101","102","104"]},"The FDT system , which may implement the SAP\u00ae NETWEAVER\u00ae FDT, includes a local rule engine  that defines and processes business rules and that outputs data using a comprehensive application programming interface (API). The local rule engine  is a hardware or software module that manages and automates business rules. The BRMS  includes an external rule engine  that also defines and processes business rules, and that outputs results of the external rule processing to the FDT system .","In one example configuration, the external rule engine  includes specialized, customized, proprietary, or protected (such as by patent or trade secret) business rules that the local rule engine  may wish to use or access. In a financial context, the external rule engine may provide a credit scoring function which accepts inputs regarding a customer's credit history, such as annual income or recent payment delinquencies, and which outputs a credit score that rates the consumer against a pool of consumers. If the FDT system  is operated by a mortgage provider, the resulting credit score may be used to determine whether to grant a loan to a consumer.","In this example, the operator of the BRMS  may not want to release the credit scoring logic used by the external rule engine  to derive the credit score, to prevent entities from discovering weaknesses that might artificially inflate a person's credit score. At the same time, the operator of the FDT system  may not want a user of the local rule engine  to know that a credit score is being sought, or require a user to take any extra steps to access credit score data.","Thus, and using the enhanced approach described herein, the local rule engine  may seamlessly interface with the BRMS  by executing a function that is itself internal to the FDT system , but which includes an expression that calls the external rule engine . In the described example, the expression may call the external rule engine by supplying context information that uniquely identifies a customer, in a format, structure or data type that is readily understood by the external rule engine based on an earlier-provided BV that assists, allows, causes or effects the definition of the external business rule.","The external rule engine  evaluates or processes the context using the rule, and provides result information (or, simply, a \u2018result\u2019) back to the local rule engine  in a format, structure or data type that is readily understood by the local rule engine . The result provided by the external rule engine  is parsed by the expression (or parse tree) of the local rule engine  associated with the called function, and an output of the function is returned to the user of the FDT system  based on the result.","Thus, the \u2018function\u2019 of the \u2018Function & Derivation Tool\u2019 refers to the triggering of processing of rule-based logic at the external rule engine  through the use of a place-holding expression that seamlessly invokes communication to an external rule engine. The \u2018derivation\u2019 of the \u2018Function & Derivation Tool\u2019 refers to a parse tree (or expression tree) that provides for the parsing of contextual input. For example, the derivation may be as sequence of statements (such as in logic or mathematics) indicating that a result is a natural consequence of previously accepted statements.","In a similar regard, an expression may thus be any combination of values, functions, tokens, atoms, and procedures, interpreted according to the particular rules of precedence and of association for a particular expression type, which computes and then returns another value. Similarly, an expression type describes the rules of precedence and association for a defined context. For each application executing a particular business process, filters may restrict the use of certain expression types, expressions, or functions, in order to reduce the quantity of available objects in a given scenario.","As inferred above, the input to an function or expression is referred to as the \u2018context,\u2019 and the output (or return value) of an expression is referred to as a \u2018result.\u2019 Both the context and the result may include data elements such as fields, structures or tables, or a set of data objects such as a scalar value, a work area, or a vector value, where a scalar refers to a variable that holds one value at a time, and a vector is a collection of scalars.","In one example instance, a function that models a health insurance business rule may include an expression that accepts a table listing multiple patient names as input, or that accepts a single element indicative of a single patient name as input. This function may output an elemental data field indicating whether any of the patients named in the table are insured by an entity executing the business rule, or may output a table listing dates and descriptions of recent medical treatments. The \u2018rule\u2019 may thus be understood as an expression or hierarchy of expressions assigned to a particular function, such as an insurance fraud detection function, a credit scoring function, or other exemplary function. The specific rule applied to the input context may depend on the type, description, or structure of the input context.","In another example instance, \u2018business objects\u2019 are input into each business process, where business objects represent uniquely identifiable business components, entities, or data described by a structural model, an internal process model, or service interfaces. Example business object types includes core or hosting business object (e.g. a purchase order, a customer invoice request, or a purchase order), replicated business objects (e.g. a planning view on a core business object such as a purchase order), a business object template (e.g. a maximal template of product with all attributes), a dependent business object (e.g. a reuse part of another business object such as an address), a business foundation object (e.g. an object located in a foundation layer such as a business partner).","In contrast to a \u2018notion object,\u2019 a \u2018business object\u2019 describes an entity type and not necessarily the instance of the entity itself. Similarly, a dependent business object is a business object which is used (as a reuse part) in or by another business object, and which represents a concept that cannot stand by itself, from a business perspective. Although instances of dependent business objects may occur in the context of a business object, dependent objects are equivalent in terms of structure and functionality over a range of embedding objects.",{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0042","num":"0041"},"figref":"FIG. 2","b":["200","200","200"]},"In more detail, when the process  begins (S), a rule engine vocabulary (or BV) including a context description and a result description that respectively define an input to and an output of an external rule engine is automatically generated (S). In order to allow the FDT system (or a component of the FDT system such as the local rule engine) to access the BRMS, a function is modeled within the local rule engine to trigger the processing of the rule-based logic at the external rule engine through the use of a place-holding expression. Thus the function should be modeled or specified with data descriptions that can be understood by the external rule engines, so that appropriate data may be transmitted to the external rule engine based on a call to the function.","The local rule engine supports many different data object descriptions. For example, Table 1 lists different types of the \u2018data element\u2019 data object that are supported by an exemplary local rule engine, and Table 2 lists different types of the \u2018structure\u2019 data object that are supported by an exemplary local rule engine, where a structure generally refers to a list of similar-type data elements. In addition to data elements and structures, the exemplary local rule engine may also support a table data object, which (like a structure) includes a list of similar-type data elements but which (unlike a structure) includes defined headers.",{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0045","num":"0044"},"tables":{"@attributes":{"id":"TABLE-US-00001","num":"00001"},"table":{"@attributes":{"frame":"none","colsep":"0","rowsep":"0"},"tgroup":[{"@attributes":{"align":"left","colsep":"0","rowsep":"0","cols":"1"},"colspec":{"@attributes":{"colname":"1","colwidth":"217pt","align":"center"}},"thead":{"row":{"entry":"TABLE 1"}},"tbody":{"@attributes":{"valign":"top"},"row":[{"entry":{"@attributes":{"namest":"1","nameend":"1","align":"center","rowsep":"1"}}},{"entry":"Data Element Data Object Types."}]}},{"@attributes":{"align":"left","colsep":"0","rowsep":"0","cols":"3"},"colspec":[{"@attributes":{"colname":"1","colwidth":"91pt","align":"left"}},{"@attributes":{"colname":"2","colwidth":"91pt","align":"left"}},{"@attributes":{"colname":"3","colwidth":"35pt","align":"center"}}],"tbody":{"@attributes":{"valign":"top"},"row":[{"entry":["Data Type Definition","Reference Type","Length"]},{"entry":{"@attributes":{"namest":"1","nameend":"3","align":"center","rowsep":"1"}}}]}},{"@attributes":{"align":"left","colsep":"0","rowsep":"0","cols":"3"},"colspec":[{"@attributes":{"colname":"1","colwidth":"91pt","align":"left"}},{"@attributes":{"colname":"2","colwidth":"91pt","align":"left"}},{"@attributes":{"colname":"3","colwidth":"35pt","align":"char","char":"."}}],"tbody":{"@attributes":{"valign":"top"},"row":[{"entry":["ELEMENT_BOOLEAN","CHAR","1"]},{"entry":["ELEMENT_CURRENCY","CURY"]},{"entry":["ELEMENT_NUMBER","DF34_RAW","34"]},{"entry":["ELEMENT_TEXT","CHAR","80"]},{"entry":["ELEMENT_UNIT","CHAR","3"]},{"entry":"ELEMENT_AMOUNT"},{"entry":["Number","ELEMENT_NUMBER"]},{"entry":["Currency","ELEMENT_CURRENCY"]},{"entry":"ELEMENT_QUANTITY"},{"entry":["Number","ELEMENT_NUMBER"]},{"entry":["Unit","ELEMENT_UNIT"]},{"entry":"ELEMENT_TIMEPOINT"},{"entry":["Date","DATS"]},{"entry":["Time","TIMS"]},{"entry":["Timestamp","TIMESTAMP"]},{"entry":["Offset_time","TIMS"]},{"entry":["Offset_sign","TZNUTCSIGN"]},{"entry":{"@attributes":{"namest":"1","nameend":"3","align":"center","rowsep":"1"}}}]}}]}}},{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0046","num":"0045"},"tables":{"@attributes":{"id":"TABLE-US-00002","num":"00002"},"table":{"@attributes":{"frame":"none","colsep":"0","rowsep":"0"},"tgroup":[{"@attributes":{"align":"left","colsep":"0","rowsep":"0","cols":"1"},"colspec":{"@attributes":{"colname":"1","colwidth":"217pt","align":"center"}},"thead":{"row":{"entry":"TABLE 2"}},"tbody":{"@attributes":{"valign":"top"},"row":[{"entry":{"@attributes":{"namest":"1","nameend":"1","align":"center","rowsep":"1"}}},{"entry":"Structure Data Object Types"}]}},{"@attributes":{"align":"left","colsep":"0","rowsep":"0","cols":"3"},"colspec":[{"@attributes":{"colname":"1","colwidth":"70pt","align":"left"}},{"@attributes":{"colname":"2","colwidth":"112pt","align":"left"}},{"@attributes":{"colname":"3","colwidth":"35pt","align":"center"}}],"tbody":{"@attributes":{"valign":"top"},"row":[{"entry":["Data Type Definition","Reference Type","Length"]},{"entry":{"@attributes":{"namest":"1","nameend":"3","align":"center","rowsep":"1"}}},{"entry":["S_ELEMENT","STANDARD TABLE OF",{}]},{"entry":[{},"S_MESSAGE"]},{"entry":["Position","N","3"]},{"entry":["Element_id","ID"]},{"entry":["TS_ELEMENT","SORTED TABLE OF S_ELEMENT"]},{"entry":{"@attributes":{"namest":"1","nameend":"3","align":"center","rowsep":"1"}}}]}}]}}},"The vocabulary should thus include, for each of the expected context and result, a description including a data type of the expected context and result. For instance, the vocabulary may describe that an expected context (or input) may be a patient name of type , or a patient identification number of type , or an expected treatment cost of type . The expected result (or output) may be similarly described. Since the expected inputs and outputs of the function are known to the FDT system, the FDT system may automatically generate its own BV for export to the external rule engine by referencing the expected inputs and outputs of a particular function. Notably, since the vocabulary is based on a context provided during the design time phase, it is not necessary for the rule engines to derive templates or schemas based on past communication.","The context description may be data type that is native to the external rule engine. For instance, the vocabulary may be automatically generated using generic data objects, such as a field, structure, or table data objects. In doing so, the vocabulary may be used to specify the basic language constructs that define the universe of discourse between the local and external rule engines. In this regard, the vocabulary may be viewed as a published description of the intended format, type or structure of the context and the result that are to be communicated between the local rule engine and the external rule engine.","Referring ahead briefly,  illustrates the relationship between exemplary local rule engine data types. The class , the class , and the class  each inherit characteristics and functions from the abstract class , which defines and implements generic methods and attributes. The class  inherits characteristics and functions from the class, which addresses administrative data  and transaction handling. The top-level interface  centralizes various attributes to one interface for structured access to administrative methods and attributes.","Returning to , an expression including a connection to the external rule engine may be modeled, specified, or otherwise defined (S) to logically connect the local rule engine to the external engine, thereby allowing for the communication of contexts and results data calls. The connection is defined as a placeholder EBRMS expression that allows the local rule engine to be seamlessly integrated with the external rule engine, using local rule engine-internal rule processing approaches. Since users of the local rule engine are not alerted to the external calls, complexity and integration costs are reduced.","The local rule engine may include generic expression subclasses such as the instance constant expression subclass, decision table expression subclass, a decision tree expression subclass, a formula expression subclass, and a function call expression subclasses, as well as the aforementioned EBRMS expression subclass that allows for communication between the local and external rule engines. The EBRMS expression subclass may include, for example an association to an abstract GBRMS CONNECTOR class that encapsulates parameters and function calls that are generally used to communicate with the external rule engine. The EBRMS expression instance is thus chosen, created, specified or otherwise defined within the expression tree at the local rule engine to connect the local rule engine to the external rule engine once the rule has been defined at the external rule engine (see infra, S).","Defining the expression may further include querying the rule engine to determine connection parameters, and selecting the defined expression from a list of possible expressions based on the determined connection parameters. The EBRMS expression subclass may include ( ), ( ), and P( ) functions that allow the local rule engine to determine these connection parameters and distinguish between various external rule engine application platform subclasses, using reflecting programming. For example, using the P( ) function, a local rule engine may determine that the external rule engine uses a Java adapter, and may specify an EBRMS expression that implements a Java BRMS connector that encapsulates parameters and function calls used to communicate with a Java Adapter of the external rule engine.","The rule engine vocabulary is serialized or packaged in a schema document (S), which may be an XSD. Included in the schema document are the context and result definitions or descriptions that were automatically generated (see, supra, S), so as to be provided to the external rule engine. Since the context or result may be an element, structure, table or other type of data, the schema document identifies which type of data the context or result is expected to be and provides a run-time XML element associated with the identified data type.","The schema document expresses a set of rules to which a document must conform in order to be considered \u2018valid\u2019 according to that schema. In this regard, other schema document languages or approaches, such as RELAX NG, or Document Type Definitions (DTDs), or Schematron may be substituted or used as an adjunct for an XSD. The vocabulary serialized in the schema document allows rules to be defined on the basis of the terms and relations encoded in the vocabulary.",{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0055","num":"0054"},"figref":"FIG. 4","b":["401","402","404","401","401","405"],"smallcaps":["INCLUDE","CHEMA.XSD"]},"The schema document  should also incorporate standard components  (such as a W3C XML Schema), as well as a schema extension component  (FDT_T) that extends the standard components  to specify a business context name and to define additional data constructs. The schema extension component  may be imported (via an <> element) as a second namespace by the schema document . As indicated above, the schema document  is transmitted form the local rule engine  to the external rule engine  during a design time phase . As described in further detail below (see, infra, S to S), the schema document  is used as a basis for defining a rule at the external rule engine , where the rule is used during a run time phase  to process contexts  generated by the local rule engine  according to the vocabulary, and to output results .","Table 3, below, illustrates a portion of an example schema document.

Lines 10 to 15 define a \u201cPatient_Name\u201d context element, of type . From this element definition, the external rule engine should expect textual context data, presumably inputting a name of a patient, for further evaluation and processing by the rule.","The schema document is transmitted to the external rule engine (S). A rule is defined and tested at the external rule engine based on the context description and the result description included in the received schema document (S). When received at the external rule engine, the schema document allows a rule to be defined based on the context description and the result description. The schema document thus provides a basis for the definition of rules by the external rule engine.","The BV is derived from the FDT context, and is provided in a generic format in the schema document. From the BV, which is defined and provisioned during the design phase, the rule is defined by the BRMS during the design time phase and deployed for the runtime phase phase. Using the BV, the external rule engine uses an import function to link XMA and Java templates by associating XSD entities and attributes, or by creating or updating templates corresponding to XSD entities, or attributes of such templates that corresponding to XSD attributes and that refer to nested entities (where no more than one may occur). Furthermore, the external rule engine may create or update templates representing any XSD relationships other than tree structure, concepts implemented by such templates and attributes, relations between such concepts as exist between the templates and their attributes that correspond to the imported schema documents, or verb phrasings for such relations.","Concepts, relations, and verb phrasings can only be updated (not created), if an XML template is assigned.

In this example, the external rule engine evaluates transactional data, such as patient or treatment data, and outputs an indication of whether a submitted invoice may be fraudulent. The local rule engine may execute on a physician's invoicing billing system, and may have access to a database storing the transactional data.","Medical doctors typically list prescribed treatments in order to claim reimbursement payments from the health insurance provider. Since the patients receiving the treatments may not be trained to review health insurance invoices for accuracy, unscrupulous medical doctors may bill a health insurance provider for phony treatments, by listing more treatments on an invoice than were actually applied.","Health insurance providers receive vast quantities of invoices for payment processing each day, making manual checking of invoices economically unfeasible. Thus, health insurance providers use automated mechanisms to check incoming invoices for inconsistencies that allude to this type of potential fraud, using logical (\u201cif . . . then . . . \u201d) tests.","For each invoice presented to the health insurance provider, a rule engine checks each invoice line item with respect to the described treatment personal data of the patient or regarding a given timeframe or on a single invoice. For instance, a rule may indicate that, if a patient receives a first treatment, then the patient is not supposed to get a second treatment on the same invoice. Another rule may dictate that, if a patient receives a first treatment, then the patient is not supposed to receive second and\/or third treatments during the next quarter. Further rules may dictate that, if a patient receives rehabilitation treatment, then the rehabilitation treatment must start at most fourteen days after the surgery; or that if a patient receives a free preventive medical checkup, then he must be male and at least thirty year old.","It is also beneficial to be able to create arbitrary compositions of treatments for consistency checks, which is covered by chaining functionality provided by business rule engines. An external rule engine should be provided with access to the entire treatment history over a relevant time frame (i.e. the period on which consistency checks are necessary) of a patient, otherwise it may not be possible to accurately perform a consistency check.
