{"@attributes":{"id":"description"},"BRFSUM":[{},{}],"heading":["BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION","FIELD OF THE INVENTION","SUMMARY OF THE INVENTION","DESCRIPTION OF THE PREFERRED EMBODIMENTS"],"p":["The invention lies in the telecommunications technology field and pertains, more specifically, to a connection device for connecting a telecommunications system to a data processing device by means of which telecommunications applications are provided for the telecommunications system.","Supplementary services, such as call center applications, voice recognition, and text-to-speech conversion, which are provided primarily in private telecommunications networks, can be implemented with so-called \u201cComputer Telephony Integration\u201d (CTI). The services\u2014hereinafter referred to as telecommunications applications\u2014are normally implemented by means of central CTI servers (e.g. a media framework) provided in the private telecommunications networks, and are made available to a telecommunications system or its users. Telecommunications applications are made available by means of a CTI server of this type, for example according to the S and H recommendations of the Enterprise Computer Telephony Forum (ECTF).","In order to make the telecommunications applications of a CTI server available to the telecommunications system, a connection\u2014which may be based, for example, on analog, ISDN-oriented or packet-oriented data transmission\u2014is required between the CTI server and the telecommunications system. Control signals and status monitoring between the telecommunications system and the server can be implemented as required via a separate connection according to the CSTA protocol (CSTA=Computer Supported Telecommunications Application).","A connection is established between a CTI server and the telecommunications system via special connection modules\u2014often referred to in the literature as line cards. A connection can be established between a CTI server and the telecommunications system, for example, via connection modules providing analog a\/b or digital Sor Sinterfaces. TDM-oriented (TDM=Time Division Multiplex) switching networks of the telecommunications system and the CTI server are in each case interconnected with the aid in each case of one connection module in the telecommunications system and the CTI server. In this way, one or more user data channels\u2014for example ISDN-oriented B-channels\u2014of the telecommunications system can be connected to the resources of the CTI server.","The disadvantage of this configuration is that expensive line signaling is required for the connection, i.e. for connection set-up and cleardown between the CTI server and the telecommunications system. The line signaling takes up resources, e.g. processor power and memory capacity, in both the telecommunications system and the CTI server. Under load, this results in some instances in long switching times, particularly in medium-sized and large systems.","The object of the present invention is to provide a device for connecting a data processing device with a telecommunications system which overcomes the above-noted deficiencies and disadvantages of the prior art devices and methods of this general kind, and which enables a simple connection between the telecommunications system and the server for the provision of telecommunications applications.","With the above and other objects in view there is provided, in accordance with the invention, a connection device which connects a telecommunications system and a data processing device providing telecommunications applications. Each of the telecommunications system and the data processing device having a switching network for through-connecting a respective telecommunications application to a user connected to the telecommunications system. The connection device for connecting the telecommunications system to the data processing device is directly connected between the respective switching networks.","According to the present invention, a switching network of the telecommunications system is connected with the aid of the connection device to a switching network of the data processing device\u2014in particular a CTI server based on the conventional S. and H. specifications\u2014or specific switching points of the relevant switching networks are directly interconnected. For this purpose, according to the invention, the telecommunications system has a first interface for direct connection of the switching network of the telecommunications system to the switching device according to the invention. The first interface, which represents one or more direct switching points of the switching network, is controlled via a virtual subscriber which is set up in the telecommunications system and is assigned to the switching device.","The advantage of the direct interconnection of the two switching networks according to the invention is that hardware cost is substantially reduced compared with the state of the art. The elimination of the connection modules required according to the state of the art in both the telecommunications system and the data processing device results in cost savings compared with the state of the art.","Furthermore, fast switching occurs between the switching network of the telecommunications system and the switching network of the data processing device, e.g. via the Siemens AG SWTI switching network module, since the high-cost line signaling, e.g. during a connection set up or cleardown, can be dispensed with.","In accordance with an added feature of the invention, the connection device is configured to perform a bi-directional conversion between a data format supported by the switching network of the telecommunications system and a data format supported by the switching network of the data processing device.","In accordance with an additional feature of the invention, the connection device in each case interconnects at least one time slot of the respective switching networks.","One or more switching points of the relevant switching networks are advantageously interconnected by the switching device according to the invention. In TDM switching networks (Time Division Multiplex), specific time slots of the switching network of the telecommunications system are directly interconnected by means of the switching device with specific time slots of the switching network of the data processing device.","During the data transmission, the switching device carries out a bidirectional conversion between the data formats supported by the two systems, i.e. the switching device carries out an interface conversion between the switching network of the telecommunications system and the switching network of the data processing device or the relevant switching points.","In accordance with another feature of the invention, the connection device is configured to implement voice data applications between the telecommunications system and the data processing device. The switching device according to the invention is advantageously used by the data processing device for an implementation of speech applications, such as speech recognition and text-to-speech applications.","In accordance with a further feature of the invention, a virtual subscriber is set up in the telecommunications system and assigned to the connection device, for controlling the connection device. In other words, in order to control the specific time slots or switching points of the telecommunications system, the switching point(s) must be defined as a virtual\u2014preferably exclusively software-implemented\u2014subscriber of the telecommunications system. This\/these switching point(s) can thus be addressed in the same way as a conventional extension of the telecommunications system.","In accordance with again an added feature of the invention, a separate connection is provided to transmit control and monitoring information between the telecommunications system and the data processing device according to the CSTA protocol.","In other words, the switching points used in the telecommunications system are controlled and monitored via a second interface, advantageously via the standardized CSTA protocol (Computer Supported Telecommunications Application).","In accordance with again another feature of the invention, the connection device is a separate device. In the alternative, the connection device is implemented as an interface unit in the data processing device.","Other features which are considered as characteristic for the invention are set forth in the appended claims.","Although the invention is illustrated and described herein as embodied in a device for connecting a data processing device to a telecommunications system, it is nevertheless not intended to be limited to the details shown, since various modifications and structural changes may be made therein without departing from the spirit of the invention and within the scope and range of equivalents of the claims.","The construction and method of operation of the invention, however, together with additional objects and advantages thereof will be best understood from the following description of specific embodiments when read in connection with the accompanying drawings.","Referring now to the figures of the drawing in detail and first, particularly, to  thereof, there is seen a prior art CTI configuration. The configuration comprises a telecommunications system  and a CTI server \u2014in particular a media framework designed according to the known S. and H. specifications\u2014for the provision of telecommunications applications for the telecommunications system  or subscribers\u2014not shown\u2014assigned to the telecommunications system .","The telecommunications system  sets up a connection to the external CTI server  via a switching network . The interfaces for data transmission are in each case formed by connection modules  and  of the telecommunications system  or by connection modules  and  of the CTI server . Data transmission can be carried out, for example, according to a time-slot-oriented continuous transmission method and\/or according to a packet-oriented transmission method.","In the CTI server , a connection is set up via the switching network \u2014preferably configured according to the H. specification\u2014with function units FE\u2014frequently referred to in the literature as \u2018Resource Boards\u2019\u2014which implement the relevant telecommunications applications\u2014e.g. speech recognition (ASR=Automatic Speech Recognition) or text-to-speech (TTS). These function units FE access application software A-SW which controls the relevant telecommunications applications via an interface S.-API (API=Application Programming Interface). The application software A-SW is in turn connected via suitable interfaces TAPI (Telephony Application Programming Interface) and TSP (Telephony Service Provider) to the telecommunications system . Information is transmitted via these interfaces according to the CSTA protocol (CSTA=Computer Supported Telecommunications Application) for control and monitoring between the telecommunications system  and the CTI server .",{"@attributes":{"id":"P-00030","num":"00030"},"figref":"FIG. 2","b":["11","12"]},"The switching device  according to the invention interconnects the relevant switching networks  and  or specific switching points of the switching networks  and  of the telecommunications system  and the CTI server . These switching points correspond, for example in a TDM-oriented switching network, to one or more time slots, which are in each case directly interconnected via the switching device .","To connect the switching device  according to the invention to the telecommunications system , the telecommunications system  has a first interface , which directly provides one or more switching points of the switching network . In order to address the switching points by means of the telecommunications system  or by means of a control unit\u2014not shown\u2014of the telecommunications system , a virtual subscriber is set up in the telecommunications system  via a, preferably software-implemented, subscriber device . The interface  is addressed via the virtual subscriber, for example via extensions of the telecommunications system  or via the CTI server  by means of the CSTA protocol via a second interface  of the telecommunications system .","The switching device  according to the invention is advantageously an autonomous device which is connected externally between the telecommunications system  and the CTI server  or is alternatively implemented as an internal interface in the CTI server .","Referring now to , there is shown an embodiment of the present invention. As compared with the prior art , the connection modules for connecting the telecommunications system  to the CTI server  are dispensed with. The further components shown in  have already been explained with reference to .","With the aid of the switching device  according to the invention, which can be implemented, for example, with the Siemens AG TEB SWT switching network component, the external CTI server  is connected as an extension box via a standard connection cable to existing telecommunications systems .","The switching device  according to the invention is incorporated as a basic hardware component, for example for a S. media server as a resource for a call channel, into a suitable S. environment (for example, Dialogic\/Microsoft S. API)."],"brief-description-of-drawings":[{},{}],"description-of-drawings":{"heading":"BRIEF DESCRIPTION OF THE DRAWINGS","p":[{"@attributes":{"id":"P-00024","num":"00024"},"figref":"FIG. 1"},{"@attributes":{"id":"P-00025","num":"00025"},"figref":"FIG. 2"},{"@attributes":{"id":"P-00026","num":"00026"},"figref":"FIG. 3"}]},"DETDESC":[{},{}]}
