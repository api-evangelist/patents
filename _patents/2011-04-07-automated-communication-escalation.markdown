{"@attributes":{"id":"description"},"RELAPP":[{},{}],"heading":["CROSS REFERENCE TO RELATED APPLICATIONS","BACKGROUND","SUMMARY","DETAILED DESCRIPTION"],"p":["The present application claims priority to U.S. Provisional Patent Application No. 61\/420,113 filed Dec. 6, 2010, the disclosure of which is hereby incorporated by reference in its entirety.","Wireless communication devices are used extensively by a variety of users, from business persons to children. In some cases, a supervising person (e.g., business owner\/manager or parent, etc.) may attempt to communicate with a user of a wireless communication device (e.g., employee or child), and the targeted user of the device may not respond accordingly.","Current automated communication system applications may initiate communication attempts with a user of a wireless communication device via SMS (Short Message Service), MMS (Multi Media Service), Email (Electronic Mail), phone call, etc. Some applications may allow this communication attempt to be repeated automatically after a period of time. Current methods used by an initiating party to communicate with a targeted party may be to send a message using one of the aforementioned methods and wait for a response.","While these systems provide some useful methods for establishing communication with a targeted party, current methods to encourage the targeted party to respond are limited and do not provide a means for communication attempts to be automatically escalated and, if desired, to invoke limitations on the use of the targeted party's wireless communication device to compel the targeted party to respond to an initiating party. It is with respect to these and other considerations that the present invention has been made.","Consistent with embodiments of the present invention, systems and methods are disclosed for allowing an initiating party to invoke automated communication attempts that continue and escalate and limit the targeted party's wireless communication device capabilities until satisfactory communication is established with the targeted party. It should be appreciated that an initiating party may be a parent, work supervisor, or other authority-type figure who may have certain privileges over a targeted party's communication device. According to an embodiment, after a number of unsuccessful attempts at communicating with the targeted party, the initiating party may activate an automated escalating communication system that encourages the targeted party to eventually respond due to limiting controls placed on the targeted party's wireless communication device.","The details of one or more embodiments are set forth in the accompanying drawings and description below. Other features and advantages will be apparent from a reading of the following detailed description and a review of the associated drawings. It is to be understood that the following detailed description is explanatory only and is not restrictive of the invention as claimed.","As briefly described above, embodiments of the present invention are directed to allowing an initiating party to establish communications with a targeted party using automated escalation of communications methods. As will be described below, according to embodiments, an initiating party (e.g., a business supervisor, parent, guardian, or the like) may provision an automated escalation feature on a wireless communication device so that the initiating party may encourage the targeted party to respond. This automated escalation method may invoke feature limiting controls on the targeted party's wireless communication device if the desired response is not received from the targeted party.","When attempts at communication are placed to a targeted wireless communication device without a desired response from the targeted party, an authorized initiating party may be authorized to begin an automated communication escalation method. For example, an initiating party may be a parent or guardian attempting to communicate with a child unwilling to respond. Attempts to communicate may be automatically repeated by a control center. After a specified number of attempts, the control center may then initiate attempts at communication with additional targeted parties. Other targeted parties may include, but are not limited to, manually entered contacts associated with the first targeted party, contacts from the first targeted party's address book, contacts with whom the first targeted party communicates with most often, or contacts that may be near the first targeted party as determined by presence information. Other attempts to communicate may occur through social networking sites such as Facebook, MySpace, and the like. If these methods fail, features on the targeted party's wireless communication device may be controlled by the initiating party. For example, feature limitation may include denying access to social networking sites or denying any access to the Internet from the wireless communication device.","Another example of feature limitation may include limiting the ability of the target wireless device to send or receive communications, except for communications with a predetermined party (e.g., the initiating party) specified in a control center database. If communication attempts are made from the targeted wireless communication device to parties other than those allowed, the communication attempts may be automatically directed to the initiating party.","As another example, automated communication escalation may be utilized within a business where it may be deemed appropriate to invoke feature control over an employee's wireless communication device. The initiating party may be an employer, manager, supervisor, or security monitor of the employee.","These embodiments may be combined, other embodiments may be utilized, and structural changes may be made without departing from the spirit or scope of the present invention. The following detailed description is therefore not to be taken in a limiting sense, and the scope of the present invention is defined by the appended claims and their equivalents. Referring now to the drawings, in which like numerals refer to like elements throughout the several figures, embodiments of the present invention and an exemplary operating environment will be described.",{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0020","num":"0019"},"figref":"FIG. 1A","b":["100","102","104","106","125"]},"As should be appreciated, numerous end-point devices may be utilized to send and\/or receive calls and\/or messages in various operating environments according to embodiments of the present invention, including but not limited to personal computers , server computers, wireline telephones , wireless telephones , digital phones, video phones, text messaging devices, VoIP phones , set-top boxes , personal digital assistants , handheld computing devices, and distributed computing environments that may include any of the above devices.","Wireless communication devices, such as a mobile phone , PDA , or other mobile computing devices may be connected to a wireless voice and data network . A wireless network may connect to a public switched telephone network (PSTN)  and\/or may connect to a packet-switched network (Internet)  via a wireless network gateway. Plain old telephone system (POTS) and landline telephones  may connect to a wireless network  via a public switched telephone network (PSTN) . A VoIP network gateway  may serve as a translator between a PSTN  and IP networks . Dedicated VoIP phones  allow VoIP calls without the use of a computer . A VoIP phone  may connect directly to an IP network  to communicate with other endpoints. Personal computers  may connect to an IP network  for various communications, such as voice, e-mail, messaging, faxing, etc. As should be appreciated, transmission technologies for delivery of voice and\/or data communications over IP networks such as the Internet or other packet-switched networks is a known technology to those skilled in the art and will not be discussed in extensive detail herein.","Recently, cable set-top boxes (STB)  have become more than a device in which to receive digital television, but may be used to provide a variety of services, including but not limited to, telephone services, high-speed Internet access, Video on Demand (VOD), and information services. A STB  may function to receive stream of IP packets that may carry video, voice, and\/or data information for display on a connected television set .","According to an embodiment of the present invention, a presence server  may be connected to an IP network  and may be utilized to receive current presence and availability data of a contact. A contact's presence information may be shared with others who may wish to know the availability or willingness of the contact to communicate. A presence server  may be operable to receive presence information of multiple devices of a user. This functionality is referred to as multiple points of presence (MPOP). A presence server  may track the presence of a targeted party's computer , mobile phone , PDA , landline\/POTS phone , STB , etc.","According to an embodiment, an automated communication escalation system  is a software application module operative to provide automated escalated communications to a targeted communication device. Automated communication escalation system  may be located locally on a user's communication device, may be located within a service provider network, or may be located in a remote server and accessed via components of the distributed communications network . According to an embodiment, automated communication escalation system  may comprise a set of application programming interfaces (API) exposed to applications and operating systems that allow communication between applications and operating systems through common data calls understood via the API set.","Having described elements of an architecture  in which embodiments of the invention may be practiced,  is a simplified block diagram illustrating a wireless communications network architecture that serves as an example exemplary operating environment for the present invention. As should be understood, the example wireless communications network architecture  illustrated in  is for purposes of example and is not limiting of a variety of communications configurations that may be utilized as described herein. Referring now to , wireless communication services are provided by various service provider companies through a wireless network . As is known to those skilled in the art, wireless networks  may consist of but not be limited to cellular towers , base stations , and a Mobile Telephone Switching Office (hereafter referred to as \u201cMTSO\u201d) .","As is known to those skilled in the art, a cellular tower  may consist of a steel pole or lattice structure outfitted with antennae for transmitting and receiving signals to and from wireless devices (for example, mobile phone , personal digital assistant (PDA) , smart phone , etc.), other cellular towers, and the MTSO. Each cellular tower  may have multiple sets of antenna mounted, depending upon how many different service providers use the tower . As should be appreciated, cellular towers  may be freestanding towers, or may be mounted on existing structures, such as trees, water tanks, or tall buildings.","The base  of each cellular tower  may include sets of transmitters and receivers from each service provider having antennae mounted to the tower . As a unit, the cellular tower  and the base  form a system capable of transmitting, receiving, and managing data. This data may consist of, but not be limited to, voice, text, and\/or electronic media. As is understood by those skilled in the art, wireless systems typically operate at various frequencies (e.g., across a frequency range from 700 megahertz (MHz) to 1900 MHz), depending upon which wireless technology is utilized. According to the embodiments of the present invention, Intermediary Monitoring Control (IMC) systems may operate across this typical network of wireless systems, and therefore in the same frequency ranges.","Referring still to , a wireless network may also employ the use of a wireless electronic communication device , (e.g., mobile phone, personal digital assistant (PDA), smart phone, etc.) capable of sending and receiving voice and data communications in the same frequency range as the wireless communications system. As is understood by those skilled in the art, a mobile device , comprises, but is not limited to, an internal circuit board, antenna, liquid crystal display (LCD), keyboard, microphone, speaker, and a battery. All of these components and systems making up a mobile communication device ,, work together to send, receive, and manage voice and data communications within and beyond the cellular network.","Referring still to , an MTSO  serves as a central control center for the base stations  operating in a given area. For example, an MTSO  may be configured for controlling wireless communications for a wireless service provider operating in a specified city or other suitable operating area or region. In addition to other operating functions of the MTSO, according to embodiments of the present invention, the MTSO  may serve as control point for determining, providing and controlling subscriber features. For example, in accordance with embodiments of this invention, a customer information database  may contain data to allow a determination as to whether a particular feature or service is provisioned for a given mobile communication device account. An example of such a feature or service may be Caller ID , Call Waiting , Voicemail , or Automated Escalation System . Thus, if an initiating party  using mobile communication device , wishes to invoke automated escalation on mobile device ,, a subscriber database  may be parsed to determine if the desired features are provisioned on the targeted party's  mobile communication device and if the initiating party  is authorized to invoke the automated escalation.","As briefly described above, if an initiating party  (e.g., business supervisor, parent, guardian, and the like) is authorized to invoke automated escalation on a targeted party  (e.g., employee, child, etc.), an Automated Communication Escalation feature  may be provisioned at the MTSO  on the targeted party's  mobile communication device ,. When instructions are received at the MTSO  for invoking automated escalation to the targeted party's communication device, the automated communication escalation may begin as described herein and continue until the initiating party  sends instructions to the MTSO  to stop or until a communication is successfully made between the targeted party's communication device , and the initiating party's communication device.","Example Automated Communication Escalation","According to one example use case, automated communication escalation may include an automated series of escalating communications. For example, a parent (initiating party ) may call his\/her child (targeted party ) and\/or send a text or video message instructing the child to call the parent. The child  may not respond to the parent's instructions, wherein the parent  may select to send an automated series of escalating communications. A communication may include an SMS message, an MMS message, an instant message, a voice call, a video call a message to a contact or affiliate of a targeted party , a social network posting, etc. An SMS message may be automatically sent to the child . The message may include an instruction, such as, \u201cCall Home.\u201d After a predetermined amount of time, if no communication attempt is made by the child  with the parent , another SMS message may be automatically sent. After another predetermined amount of time, if no communication attempt is made by the child  with the parent , an escalated communication may be automatically sent.","According to an embodiment, an escalated communication may be an SMS message, a voice call or a video call to one or more affiliates of a targeted party . An affiliate of a targeted party  to whom to send a communication may be a manually entered affiliate or contact, or may be determined based on such data as frequency of or last communication between the targeted party  and a contact\/affiliate, or location and\/or presence information. For example, an SMS message may be sent to several friends of the child  stating, \u201cPlease ask Bob to call mom.\u201d According to another embodiment, an escalated communication may be a posting to a social network (e.g., FACEBOOK, MySpace, etc.). According to another embodiment, an escalated communication may be a voice or video call or message to an affiliate of an affiliate of the targeted party . For example, a message or voice or video call may be sent to a parent of a friend of child who is not responding to a call or message from a parent. Escalated communications may be sent a predetermined number of times, and\/or may be sent at predetermined time intervals. Escalated communications may continue to be sent automatically until the parent  cancels the automated communication escalation feature, or until a successful communication is detected between the child  and the parent .","According to another example use case, automated communication escalation may include control processes that may gradually limit functionality of a targeted party's communication device . Limited functionality may include restriction of Internet access, blocked SMS and\/or MMS messages, and\/or blocked voice and\/or video calls. For example, if a targeted party  is non-responsive, functionality of the targeted party's communication device may be limited in such a way that any use of the device, other than that of contacting the initiating party , may be locked out. Network functionality and\/or on-device application functionality may be restricted. A message (e.g., \u201cCall your Parents!\u201d) may be provided when a targeted party  tries to use his\/her device. According to an embodiment, a call may be automatically directed to a pre-selected destination (e.g., initiating party's communication device) without any additional action by the targeted party when any use of the targeted party's  communication device is detected.","According to another example use case, a combination of escalating communications and control processes may be provided. For example, a message to a targeted party  may be sent via SMS. After a given time interval, if the targeted party  has not communicated with the initiating party , another message may be sent via SMS, all outbound SMS messages from the targeted party  except messages to the initiating party  may be blocked or redirected. If the targeted party  is still unresponsive after a given time interval, an automated voice call may be sent to the targeted party , and all outbound voice calls from the targeted party's communication device may be redirected to the initiating party . After another given time interval, if the targeted party  is still unresponsive, a message may be posted on the targeted party's social networking site, and all Internet communications from the targeted party's communication device  may be blocked and redirected, except the ability to view the posted message. After another given time interval, if the initiating party  chooses to proceed with the next step, a message may be sent via SMS to a communication device of one or more associated contacts with the targeted party  (e.g., friends, co-workers, and the like) stating, \u201cPlease ask the targeted party  to contact the initiating party .\u201d After a given time interval, a message may be sent from an MTSO  or the like, asking the initiating party for permission to proceed with a next step of escalation. If permission is granted, automated voice calls may be sent to communication devices of one or more parties associated with the targeted party's associates (e.g., parents of the targeted party's friends) stating, \u201cPlease ask the targeted party  to contact the initiating party .\u201d After a time interval, permission may be requested to proceed with a next step of escalation. If permission is granted, messages may be sent via SMS to communication devices of one or more parties associated with the targeted party  stating \u201cThe targeted party  is not responsive, please respond directly to initiating party  if the whereabouts of the targeted party  are known.\u201d","According to an embodiment, an automated initiation feature may be provided. An automated initiation feature may allow an initiating party  to remotely turn on a microphone associated with a targeted party's communication device  to allow the initiating party to listen to the targeted party's surroundings. According to another embodiment, an automated initiation feature may allow for a call to be automatically initiated from a targeted party's device  to an initiating party's device  upon detection of communication device usage. According to another embodiment, an audible alert may be provided to inform a targeted party  that an initiating party  is trying to reach him\/her. The audible alert may escalate in frequency and\/or volume until a response is detected or until an initiating party  cancels the feature.","According to an embodiment, control processes may be provided to allow an initiating party  to configure automated communication escalation system  to best fit his\/her needs. Automated communication escalation system  may be implemented with predetermined rule sets, and may be flexible to allow an initiating party  to configure the system as needed. An initiating party  may manage various features associated with automated communication escalation system  via a web interface, a mobile communication device application, or a set-top box application. For example, an initiating party  may input preferred affiliates to contact in case of a non-response by a targeted party . An initiating party  may select a number of escalating messages to send, what kind of escalating messages to send, time intervals between escalating messages, network functionality restrictions, and on-device application functionality restrictions.","Automated communication escalation system  rules and logic may be located remotely on a server in a carrier network. Various network elements may be manipulated by the server. A mobile telephone switch  or traditional landline switch may access various call functions, a services control point (SCP) may re-direct or block calls, an SMS-C\/MMS-C may send\/re-direct SMS\/MMS messages, a CATV headend application server may integrate automated communication escalation system  with set-top boxes, a cellular telephone mobile Internet gateway may control\/limit Internet-related functionality, etc. An SMS-C\/MMS-C, SCP, phone switch, etc., may be modified with software to enable automated communication escalation system  functionality in part or in whole.","Alternatively, automated communication escalation system  rules and logic may be implemented as an application located on a communication device ,. Communication device functionality may be controlled\/limited with network elements being controlled for non-handset functions (e.g., placing notification calls to friends).","According to another embodiment, automated communication escalation system  may be implemented as part of a parental control system that may enforce various calling, messaging, and\/or Internet restrictions. According to another embodiment, automated communication escalation system  may be integrated with child-location-based applications.","Having described exemplary operating environments , with respect to ,  is a flow diagram showing an illustrative method  for providing automated escalated communications to a targeted party's  communication device. Referring now to , the method  begins at OPERATION  and proceeds to OPERATION , where an indication to initiate automated communication escalation system  is received. According to an embodiment, an indication to initiate automated communication escalation system  may be a result of a manual selection made by an initiating party . The selection may be made from an initiating party's communication device , or may be made from a remote network-connected computing device. Alternatively, according to another embodiment, automated communication escalation system  may be a feature associated with an initiating party's  communication device service plan, and may be in an \u201calways-on\u201d mode wherein communication traffic between an initiating party's communication device  and a targeted party's communication device  may be monitored without a manual selection being made by the initiating party.","The method  proceeds to OPERATION , where a communication from an initiating device  to a targeted device  is detected. The communication may be a voice call, a video call, an SMS message, a MMS message, an IM, or any other type of communication from an initiating party's communication device to a targeted party's communication device. The method proceeds to OPERATION , where communication traffic between the initiating device  and the targeted device  is monitored.","According to embodiments, an interface may be provided for allowing an initiating party  to define automated communication escalation system  settings. For example, an initiating party  may select a threshold of a number of communication attempts to be met or a time interval to pass after a communication is sent by the initiating party before an automated escalated communication is sent. A default threshold may be provided if an initiating party  does not access automated communication escalation settings. At DECISION OPERATION , a determination may be made to determine if a threshold (user-defined or default) has been met. For example, if an initiating party  has made a selection for an automated escalated communication to be sent after three communication attempts have been made without a response from a targeted party, and after the initiating party has attempted to reach a targeted party three times, the threshold will have been met. If the threshold has not been met, the method  may resume monitoring communication traffic at OPERATION . If the threshold has been met, the method  continues to DECISION OPERATION , where a determination may be made to determine if a communication response from a targeted party's device  has been detected. A communication response may include, but is not limited to: a voice call, an SMS message, a MMS message, or an IM. If a response is detected, the method  may end at OPERATION .","If a response is not detected at OPERATION , the method  may proceed to OPERATION , where an automated escalated communication may be sent to the targeted party's communication device . According to embodiments, the automated escalated communication may be a user-defined communication type, or may be a default type of escalated communication. For example, a first automated escalated communication sent to a targeted party  may be an SMS message. The SMS message may state that the initiating party  is trying to reach the targeted party . The SMS message may include a warning that communication device functionality may be restricted if the targeted party  does not contact the initiating party . According to embodiments, an interface may be provided for an initiating party  to select from a list of automated escalated communications to send to a targeted party . According to an embodiment, permission from an initiating party  may be requested before sending one or more automated escalated communications.","OPERATIONS - may be repeated, with the automated escalated communication in OPERATION  escalating with each subsequent iteration. For example, each subsequent iteration may occur more frequently, may escalate from an SMS message to a voice or video call to a social network posting, etc. OPERATIONS - may repeat until either a response from the targeted party  is detected or until an initiating party  manually terminates the process. For example, a child may arrive at home after not answering calls from his\/her parent or returning calls to his\/her parent. Upon arrival, the parent may manually terminate automated escalated communications to the child's mobile phone. The method  ends at OPERATION .","Referring now to , a flow diagram of an illustrative method  for providing automated escalated communications to a targeted party's  communication device, and for providing device functionality modification is shown.
