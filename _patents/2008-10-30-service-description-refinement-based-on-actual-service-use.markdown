title: Service description refinement based on actual service use
abstract: Techniques are disclosed for generation and refinement of service descriptions based on records of invocations of the services, i.e., service description refinement based on actual service use. For example, a method for describing one or more services in a service-oriented environment comprised of one or more clients invoking the one or more services comprises the following steps. An initial description is established for at least one of the one or more services. Information is collected from one or more service invocations including at least one of a client identity, a value of at least one parameter, a return value, and an execution time. The information is analyzed to refine the description.

{"@attributes":{"id":"description"},"BRFSUM":[{},{}],"heading":["FIELD OF THE INVENTION","BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION","SUMMARY OF THE INVENTION","DETAILED DESCRIPTION OF PREFERRED EMBODIMENTS"],"p":["The present invention relates generally to the automatic description of software artifacts, and more particularly relates to the generation and refinement of service descriptions based on records of invocations of the services.","A situational enterprise service is a relatively small, primarily browser-based, intranet-scale situational application. In turn, a situational application is software created for a small group of users with specific needs. The application typically has a short life span, and is often created within the group where it is used, sometimes by the users themselves. As the requirements of a small team using the application change, the situational application often also continues to evolve to accommodate these changes. Significant changes in requirements may lead to an abandonment of the situational application altogether\u2014in some cases it is just easier to develop a new one than to evolve the one in use.","Illustrative embodiments of the invention provide techniques for generation and refinement of service descriptions based on records of invocations of the services, i.e., service description refinement based on actual service use. While not limited thereto, such techniques are particularly suitable for use with situational enterprise service descriptions.","For example, in one embodiment, a method for describing one or more services in a service-oriented environment comprised of one or more clients invoking the one or more services comprises the following steps. An initial description is established for at least one of the one or more services. Information is collected from one or more service invocations comprising at least one of a client identity, a value of at least one parameter, a return value, and an execution time. The information is analyzed to refine the description.","In another embodiment, a method for describing one or more services in a service-oriented environment comprised of one or more clients invoking the one or more services comprises the following steps. An initial description is established for at least one of the one or more services. Information is collected from one or more service invocations comprising at least one of a client identity, a value of at least one parameter, a return value, and an execution time by adaptively varying a collection procedure to balance an accuracy of information and system performance. The information is analyzed to refine the description. A classification scheme of tags is derived for classifying services in a hierarchy based on the information. The hierarchy is adaptively modified based on the information.","These and other objects, features, and advantages of the present invention will become apparent from the following detailed description of illustrative embodiments thereof, which is to be read in connection with the accompanying drawings.","While illustrative embodiments will be described herein in the context of situational enterprise service descriptions, it is to be understood that principles of the invention are not so limited and are more generally applicable to other appropriate services.","A situational enterprise service typically exposes a REST (Representational State Transfer) interface through which it is invoked. REST builds on HTTP (HyperText Transfer Protocol) principles to define a software architectural style where entities, containers and behaviors can be seen as resources that are accessible via a uniform interface comprised of a fixed set of verbs. REST was first introduced by Roy T. Fielding in a doctoral dissertation: \u201cArchitectural Styles and the Design of Network-based Software Architectures,\u201d University of California, Irvine, 2000, the disclosure of which is incorporated by reference herein in its entirety.","More specifically, a situational enterprise service does not use a rigorous language, such as WSDL (Web Services Description Language), to define its interface. Thus, a formal interface is not required to be defined for a situational enterprise service. Rather, informal mechanisms such as a \u201cRESTful\u201d documentation are used to describe a situational enterprise service.","The RESTful documentation of the interface exposed by a situational enterprise service is a stylized syntactic description of the REST resources exposed by the situational enterprise service. For each resource, this description includes information about the data formats of its methods, success and error codes, as well as typical examples of request and response. One representative example of RESTful documentation is given by Project Zero's RESTdoc tool (IBM Corporation, Armonk N.Y.).","A situational enterprise service is also typically annotated with tags for the purposes of content sharing and collaborative filtering. Moreover, tags are used as a form of informal semantic description of situational enterprise services.","Complete and reliable descriptions are a pre-requisite for the discovery of suitable situational enterprise services. On the other hand, it is possible for such descriptions to be incomplete, since formal interfaces are not required for situational enterprise services.","However, we have realized that it is feasible to infer the various items of RESTful documentation (e.g., format, parameters) by example from successful as well as unsuccessful invocations of a situational enterprise service. In other words, given a log of service invocations that include the URL (Uniform Resource Locator) of the service, invocation method, format, parameter values, and success or error codes, it is feasible to synthesize the RESTful documentation of a situational enterprise service.","Principles of the present invention thus provide a method for automatic description of software artifacts. In particular, principles of the present invention provide a method for the generation and refinement of situational enterprise service descriptions based on records of invocations of the situational enterprise services, henceforth referred to as \u201cservice\u201d or \u201cservices.\u201d","In one embodiment,  shows a system having features of the present invention. At least one service developer  writes at least one service . Services  are hosted by at least one service host . At least one service user  invokes at least one service  hosted on at least one service host . Service users are sometimes referred to as clients.","Service descriptions are critically important for service users  to determine which services  to invoke. Principles of the invention provide methods for a system to automatically improve and refine service descriptions based on run-time information. A service may comprise one or more computer programs. The run-time information collected by our system may include but is not limited to information about services  invoked by service users , one or more parameters passed to a service, whether the service fails, the time for the service to execute, a value returned by a service, identity of a service user, etc.","In the hosted service environment illustrated in , a service manager  receives service invocations from service users . The service manager  forwards a given invocation to the corresponding service . After the invocation of the service has completed, and a response is available, the service manager  forwards a request\/response pair corresponding to the invocation to a service description refinement component  that is the focus of the invention. The service host also includes a bookmark store  and a service description store .","The bookmark store  contains bookmarks that refer to services and that are annotated with tags. A bookmark includes the URL of the referred service. Thus, it is possible to retrieve all bookmarks that refer to a service given the service's URL.","The description store  contains the descriptions of services that have been created or refined by the system in accordance to the invention. A service description includes a syntactic description and a semantic description.","In a preferred embodiment of the invention, the syntactic description of a service is expressed as a RESTdoc document. In turn, the XML (eXtensible Markup Language) representation of RESTdoc that is targeted by the invention is given by the following instance schema:",{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0032","num":"0031"},"tables":{"@attributes":{"id":"TABLE-US-00001","num":"00001"},"table":{"@attributes":{"frame":"none","colsep":"0","rowsep":"0"},"tgroup":{"@attributes":{"align":"left","colsep":"0","rowsep":"0","cols":"2"},"colspec":[{"@attributes":{"colname":"1","colwidth":"14pt","align":"left"}},{"@attributes":{"colname":"2","colwidth":"203pt","align":"left"}}],"thead":{"row":{"entry":{"@attributes":{"namest":"1","nameend":"2","align":"center","rowsep":"1"}}}},"tbody":{"@attributes":{"valign":"top"},"row":[{"entry":[{},"<application name=\u201cstring\u201d description=\u201cstring\u201d?>"]},{"entry":[{},"\u2003<resource name=\u201cstring\u201d> +"]},{"entry":[{},"\u2003\u2003<method name=\u201cstring\u201d description=\u201cstring\u201d uri=\u201cstring\u201d> +"]},{"entry":[{},"\u2003\u2003\u2003<request> *"]},{"entry":[{},"\u2003\u2003\u2003\u2003<format name=\u201cstring\u201d\/> ?"]},{"entry":[{},"\u2003\u2003\u2003\u2003<body> ?"]},{"entry":[{},"\u2003\u2003\u2003\u2003\u2003<example\/> * \/\/ a string"]},{"entry":[{},"\u2003\u2003\u2003\u2003<\/body>"]},{"entry":[{},"\u2003\u2003\u2003<\/request>"]},{"entry":[{},"\u2003\u2003\u2003<response> *"]},{"entry":[{},"\u2003\u2003\u2003\u2003<successCode id=\u201cstring\u201d description=\u201cstring\u201d\/> *"]},{"entry":[{},"\u2003\u2003\u2003\u2003<errorCode id=\u201cstring\u201d description=\u201cstring\u201d\/> *"]},{"entry":[{},"\u2003\u2003\u2003\u2003<format name=\u201cstring\u201d\/> ?"]},{"entry":[{},"\u2003\u2003\u2003\u2003<body> ?"]},{"entry":[{},"\u2003\u2003\u2003\u2003\u2003<example\/> * \/\/ a string"]},{"entry":[{},"\u2003\u2003\u2003\u2003<\/body>"]},{"entry":[{},"\u2003\u2003\u2003<\/response>"]},{"entry":[{},"\u2003\u2003<\/method>"]},{"entry":[{},"\u2003<\/resource>"]},{"entry":[{},"<\/application>"]},{"entry":{"@attributes":{"namest":"1","nameend":"2","align":"center","rowsep":"1"}}}]}}}}},"In a preferred embodiment of the invention, the semantic description of a service is given by the collection of all tags that may annotate the service.

Optionally, if a description already exists for a service in the description store , as determined by the resource URL of the service, as conveyed by the invocation log record, then the description refiner  reads the service description from the description store  and in this case it uses the invocation log record to refine the description of the service. Otherwise, the description refiner  uses the invocation log record to generate the description of the service.","The refined service description is then stored in service descriptions store .","It is also to be appreciated that service descriptions can be further refined based on information provided by a service developer or service user.",{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0053","num":"0052"},"figref":"FIG. 3","b":["30","11","32","14","13","32"],"ul":{"@attributes":{"id":"ul0001","list-style":"none"},"li":{"@attributes":{"id":"ul0001-0001","num":"0000"},"ul":{"@attributes":{"id":"ul0002","list-style":"none"},"li":["date\/timestamp at which service was invoked","date\/timestamp at which service returned","identity of service user invoking service","parameters service was invoked with","return value","any errors"]}}}},"In step , the system analyzes the information collected in step . In step , the service description is refined based on this analysis (note that steps  and  can be combined into a single step). For example, if a service tends to fail frequently, this can be included in the service description. If it almost never fails, this can also be included in the service description. If certain types of service users (also known as clients) constitute frequent users of the system, this can be added to the service description. Performance information about the service, as well as parameters the service is invoked with, can be included in the service description.","Steps , , and  can be performed in a loop to continuously refine service descriptions. The steps do not have to be performed discretely in a particular order. For example, the system could continuously perform monitoring to collect information. Analysis of the information and service refinement could also be a continuous process.","A key aspect of the invention is that service users  can use service descriptions to determine which services to invoke. The descriptions can also be used to develop a classification scheme for services . For example, a classification scheme based on tags could be used. The tags could be arranged in a hierarchical fashion. A service could have one or more tags associated with it. The tag hierarchy can be adaptively modified based on the information collected in step .","As depicted in , if the source service is known (), as determined by a client identifier in the log record, then the description refiner  performs both semantic () as well as syntactic description refinement (). Otherwise, the description refiner  performs only syntactic description refinement (). Syntactic description refinement is depicted in , while semantic description refinement is depicted in .","Referring to , the syntactic description refinement first determines if a description already exists for the service referred to by the invocation log record (). If this is the not case, then an empty description is first created and it uses the items in the invocation log record to populate the description (). Each item in the invocation record is added () to the syntactic description of the service in accordance with the algorithm in . If a description already exists for the service referred to by the invocation log record, then, for each item in the invocation log record, it is determined whether the syntactic description contains the item (). If this is not the case, then the item is added () to the syntactic description of the service in accordance with the algorithm in . If the syntactic description does contain the item, then the item is merged () into the syntactic description of the service in accordance with the algorithm in .","Referring to , adding an invocation log record item to the syntactic description of a service first determines whether the item to be added is enumerable (). In a preferred embodiment, an item is enumerable if the number of values it can have is small enough, typically O(100), that it is reasonable to collect each individual value as part of the service description. An example of an enumerable item is the format of the invocation request or response, or the success or error code of the invocation. An example of a non-enumerable item is a request parameter value or a response value. For instance, this could be a value of some primitive data type, such as a string, or a non-primitive data-typed value, such as a JSON (JavaScript Object Notation) object.","If the item to be added is enumerable (), then a list for the corresponding item is created in the description of the service (), and the item value is added to the list ().","If the item to be added is not enumerable (), then a representative schema of any of its values is created for the item in the service description using the item value as a prototype ().

In a preferred embodiment, retrieval of the bookmarks referring to a service uses the URL of the service to lookup all bookmarks that include said URL. The collection of tags associated with a service is then comprised of the service's immediate tags and the service's bookmark tags. That is, the collection contains the tags that may have been directly associated with the service at development or deployment time, as well as all the tags in any bookmark that refers to the service.","To filter out tags, the term not-similar-enough is defined with respect to some measure of similarity. In a preferred embodiment, the measure of similarity used is a function of semantic distance, as given by the lexical meaning of a tag in a public lexical database such as WordNet.

Fu, \u201cImproved Recommendation based on Collaborative Tagging Behaviors,\u201d In Proceedings of the International ACM Conference on Intelligent User Interfaces (IUI2008), Canary Islands, Spain, 2008, the disclosure of which is incorporated by reference herein in its entirety, the similarity of two tags is inversely proportional to the WordNet distance between the two tags, where the WordNet distance is the shortest path length between the meanings of the two tags. If the semantic distance between a source tag and a target tag is greater than some configurable value, we say that the source tag is not similar enough to the target tag and we filter out the source tag. Filtering out not-similar-enough tags takes each tag from the collection of tags associated with the source service and compares it with all tags in the collection of tags associated with the target service.","A source tag that is similar enough is added to the target service's description by: (1) determining that it does not already exist in the collection of tags associated with the target service; and (2) adding the source tag to the target's collection.",{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0079","num":"0084"},"figref":["FIG. 9","FIG. 3"],"b":["90","92","32"]},"In an example of classification, a classification scheme could be used that is based on at least one parameter used in the invocation of the service. The actual parameter to be used could be indicated by a user or a tool.

For instance, if a request format parameter can take values \u2018JSON\u2019 and \u2018XML\u2019, then services that use request format as a parameter could be classified into either a \u2018JSON\u2019 category or an \u2018XML\u2019 category. If the parameter to be used is not enumerable, for instance, a request parameter value, then services could be classified based on whether the corresponding instance schemas for the given parameter value are similar, for some definition of instance schema similarity.
