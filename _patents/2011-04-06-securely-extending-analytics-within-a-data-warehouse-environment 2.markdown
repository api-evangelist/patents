title: Securely extending analytics within a data warehouse environment
abstract: A vendor is authenticated for use of a retailer's data warehouse and limited access rights are assigned to the vendor for access. The vendor accesses a graphical user interface (GUI) to select an available analysis module for execution against the data warehouse. Schemas are presented in the GUI based on the access rights, and specific schema selections are made by the vendor. The analysis module is then configured and executed against the data warehouse and filtered results are presented to the vendor; the results filtered based on the access rights assigned to the vendor.

{"@attributes":{"id":"description"},"BRFSUM":[{},{}],"heading":["BACKGROUND","SUMMARY","DETAILED DESCRIPTION"],"p":["Increasingly enterprises are relying on information collected from customers and suppliers to run their organizations more efficiently. More and more types of information from a variety of sources are being collected and housed in enterprise data warehouses. The information is then mined from a variety of automated and manual sources for purposes of running the organization more efficiently and creating improved relationships with the customers of the enterprise.","Retailers expend a lot of human assets, physical assets, and cash in maintaining and operating their data environments. Access to their data warehouses is closely guarded, since it is viewed as the lifeblood of the organizations. In fact, retailers spend a lot of money in hiring individuals to protect, maintain, and mine their data ware houses, and such individuals are not cheap by any means.","However, by closing out access to the data warehouse many potential ideas and improvements are lost by retailers. That is, many partners of a retailer, such as manufacturers or distributers of goods or services who also have a vested interest in maintaining customer loyalty and increasing the sales of their goods and services, lack access to critical information that may be useful to both the retailers and the vendors. Moreover, vendors would be willing to expend their own resources to utilize the information housed in a retailer's data warehouse, if access to the data warehouse was permitted by that retailer.","Yet, providing access can be problematic for a retailer because it includes vital competitive information of the retailer and could also expose some vendors to a loss of competitive information to another vendor having access to the data warehouse. Moreover, some agreements between a retailer and its vendors may actually prohibit the distribution of competitive information about customers to competitors of the vendors.","So, the answer is not as simple as merely providing vendors access to a retailer's data warehouse and in fact extending access to vendors is a far more complex situation. As a result, vendors generally do not have access to a retailer's data warehouse or to tools of that data warehouse.","In various embodiments, techniques for extending analytics associated with a data warehouse environment are presented. According to an embodiment, a method for securely extending analytics within a data warehouse environment is provided.","More particularly and in an embodiment, an authenticated user of a data store is associated with a user group for vendors of a retail establishment. Next, an analysis module accessible, via a data store interface, is identified that the user is requesting for processing against the data store. Then, schemas are presented within the data store interface to the user; the schemas comport with access rights of the user to the data store and the access rights based on the user group. Selections are received, via the interface, from the user: for the schemas and for options that are to be assigned to the analysis module. The analysis module is then executed using the schemas against the data store and with the selections to produce results, and the results are provided to the user.",{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0012","num":"0011"},"figref":"FIG. 1","b":["100","100"]},"At , the secure analytic extender tool associates an authenticated user of a data store with a user group for vendors of a retail establishment. The data store can include a directory, a database, a data warehouse (collection of databases), or various combinations of these things.","The user is authenticated via an authentication mechanism that provides initial access to the data store. The user group is a role assigned to the user during authentication that assigns the user to a particular user group based on an identity for the user. In the instant case, the user's identity during authentication assigns the user to the user group that is being used by vendors to access the data store that is owned and controlled by a retail establishment. In other words, with the techniques provided herein a retailer opens up its data warehouse to a vendor for doing limited analysis operations.","As will be demonstrated by the techniques that follow, by opening up a retailer's data warehouse in a limited and secure fashion both the vendor and the retailer benefit. This is so because vendors are motivated to increase profits as well as the retailer; thus, vendors may make better offers to customers to increase the sales of their goods with the retailer by using the techniques presented herein. Moreover, vendors may compete more with one another for offers; thereby creating a better environment for the customers as well. The techniques herein decentralize the marketing and planning for goods and services to the vendors of those goods and services and engage those vendors to increase customer retention and customer satisfaction.","According to an embodiment, at , the secure analytic extender tool sets access rights for the user within a communication session between the user and the data store interface. Stated another way, after the user is authenticated for access and is assigned a role (indicating the user belongs to the vendor user group), the user can be assigned access rights while interacting with the data store interface.","Continuing with the embodiment of  and at , the secure analytic extender tool disables selective features of the data store interface based on the access rights. For example, suppose the data store interface includes a feature to see a list of all users actively accessing the data store along with each user's user identifier. Because, the user interacting with the secure analytic extender tool is a vendor (based on the user's assigned user group role), such a feature can be completely disabled within the data store tool such that the vendor does not see that feature at all. It may also be that the feature is present but grayed out and unavailable to the vendor. So, features can be completely missing from view when disabled or can be viewable but inaccessible when disabled by the secure analytic extender tool","At , the secure analytic extender tool identifies an analysis module, which is accessible via the data store interface. The analysis module is being requested, via the data store interface, by the user (vendor) for purposes of having that analysis module processed against the data store of the retailer.","Analysis modules use measures to calculate the values for groups of things identified in the data store. Analysis modules use a universe of information that defines the group of things for which an analysis is to be done against. Moreover, analysis modules divide the things being analyzed into smaller sub-groups. Different analysis modules differ from one another in the way they do sub-grouping. Measures are calculated for each sub-group. For example, the measure values can be used: to count the number of people in a sub-group, to count the number of products in a sub-group that are bought, to calculate a total purchase amount of products within a sub-group, to count the number of visits made by customers to stores or a particular store within a sub-group, and the like.","In an embodiment, at , the secure analytic extender tool presents the analysis module for selection to the user within the data store interface. The available analysis modules are: a product affinity analysis module, a time graph analysis module, and\/or a pattern detection analysis module.","For the product affinity and time graph analysis modules, the schema to analyze and the schema for which the analysis is to occur against can be controlled based on the user's association with the user group (vendor group). Moreover, each schema includes its own set of schema elements that are selectable by the use and these two can be controlled based on the user's role assignment to the vendor user group.","Usage of the pattern detection analysis module is discussed by way of example below with respect to the processing at .","In another scenario, at , the secure analytic extender tool acquires the analysis module based on a selection made by the user within the data store interface from a selection of available analysis modules, which are derived based on the access rights assigned to the user for use within the data store interface. Again, the access rights can be assigned based on the user's assigned role to the vendor user group.","At , the secure analytic extender tool presents schemas within the data store interface to the user. Each presented schema comports to or with the assigned access rights of the user.","According to an embodiment, at , the secure analytic extender tool derives the schemas from original schemas within the data store. So, if an original schema includes phone numbers of customers, such information can be redacted out of a derived schema that is presented for selection to the user (vendor). Policy can dictated what is redacted out and what is not in the presented schema based on the access rights and elements in the original schema.","In an embodiment, at , the secure analytic extender tool provides at least one schema as a schema link that links two schemas, which are used by the analysis module to perform one or more calculations (measures) when the analysis module is subsequently executed.","For example, with a pattern detection analysis module, the cross schema link is used to define the two schemas and two schema elements. The cross schema link has two schemas and the data store table from which data can be retrieved and analyzed. The assignment of the user to the vendor user group is used to control the cross schema links that are displayed with the pattern detection analysis module. The cross schema link defines a relationship such that when it is selected a particular schema for an item (such as a product) is presented and selected by the user. This in turn drives the schema elements that the user can select, such as a particular category of products.","At , the secure analytic extender tool receives selections, via the data store interface, for the schema and for options that are to be assigned to the analysis module. In other words, the user, via the data store interface, selects a particular analysis module, particular schemas, and perhaps other setting values for each and this information is used by the secure analytic extender tool to configure the selected analysis module for processing against the data store using the selected schema and settings.","In an embodiment, at , the secure analytic extender tool enforces a number of the access rights against the selections made by the user within the data store interface. So, another check can be made to ensure the proper security is being enforced against the vendor (user).","At , the secure analytic extender tool executes the analysis module using the schemas against the data store and with the selections made at  for purposes of producing results.","According to an embodiment, at , the secure analytic extender tool anonymizes selective fields of the results based on the assigned access rights of the user. In other words, information can be blacked out, changed, or missing from certain fields of the results when those fields are not permitted by the access rights assigned to the vendor (user).","In another circumstance, at , the secure analytic extender tool associates a query band with the analysis module for purposes of tracking and logging usage of the analysis module by the user. Query band functionality is provided by Teradata, Inc. of Miamisburg, Ohio.","Finally, at , the secure analytic extender tool provides the results to the user. Results can be provided via the data store interface, via a separate interface, or even via a file or another data store table. Moreover, in some cases, an Application Programming Interface (API) can be used to create automated scripts that pass the results to other modules that analyze the results for the vendor. So manual and automated analysis can be achieved on the results.",{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0034","num":"0033"},"figref":"FIG. 2","b":["200","200"]},"The analytic manager presents another and in some cases enhanced perspective of the secure analytic extender tool presented above with respect to the discussion of the .","At , the analytic manager receives an analysis module selection from a user within a Graphical User Interface (GUI). The user is requesting that an analysis module for the analysis module selection be processed against a database (the database associated with the GUI).","According to an embodiment, at , provides, via the GUI, a list of available analysis modules for the user to select. The list is derived based on the user belong to the user group. So, when the user is authenticated a role assigned to the user identifies that the user is associated with the user group, and then based on this role assignment the list of available analysis modules that are available for this particular user group is presented to the user for selection via the GUI.","At , the analytic manager presents, via the GUI, one or more schemas to the user for selection. The one or more schemas are to use when processing the analysis module and the one or more schemas are acquired based on the selection of the analysis module (at ) and also based on the user's association or assignment to a particular user group.","In an embodiment, at , the analytic manager presents a number of the one or more schemas as a schema link that links two schemas with one another and that is used by the analysis module for pattern detection analysis. This scenario was discussed above with reference to the processing of  of the .","In another case, at , the analytic manager populates schema element fields for any particular schema selected by the user. Each schema element field has one or more schema elements that the user can select. Moreover, each schema element that is provided for selection is based on the particular schema selection and the user belonging to the user group.","In still another situation, at , the analytic manager obtains a first schema selection for a first schema from the user via the GUI and a second schema selection for a second schema. The analysis module, when processed, analyzes the first schema against the second schema using underlying data of the database to produce results.","At , the analytic manager processes the analysis module using user-selected ones of the schema against the database to produce the results.","In an embodiment, at , the analytic manager filters the results based on the user belonging to the user group.","In another scenario, at , the analytic manager tracks and logs the processing of the analysis module against the database by the user.","Finally, at , the analytic manager provides the results to the user for inspection. Again, this can be done via the GUI for immediate manual inspection of can be achieved via a file or database table. Moreover, the results themselves can be fed via an API to another automated service for analysis.",{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0046","num":"0045"},"figref":"FIG. 3","b":["300","300"]},"In an embodiment, the extended analytic data warehouse system  implements, inter alia, the processing discussed above with respect to the methods  and  of the , respectively.","The extended analytic data warehouse system  includes a GUI tool  and a vendor analysis service . Each of these components and their interactions with one another will now be discussed in turn.","A processor is configured with the GUI tool . The GUI tool  is programmed, implemented, and resides in a non-transitory computer-readable storage medium and is for execution on the processor or multiple processors of a multi-processor system. Example aspects of the GUI tool  were presented above with reference to the , respectively.","The GUI tool  is configured to interact with a vendor to provide analysis modules that the vendor can execute against a data store of a retailer.","According to an embodiment, the GUI tool  is a vendor analytic tool provided to the vendor from the retailer as a frontend to the data store.","The processor is also configured with the vendor analysis service , which is programmed, implemented, and resides within a non-transitory computer-readable storage medium for executing on the processor or other processors of the network in a multiprocessor system. Example processing associated with the vendor analysis service  was presented above with reference to the , respectively.","The vendor analysis service  is configured: to drive options presented within the GUI tool  to the vendor based on access rights assigned to the vendor; to receive selections from the vendor, via the GUI tool , for configuring a selected analysis module; and to execute and provide results from the execution of the selected analysis module to the vendor.","According to an embodiment, the vendor analysis service  is further configured to filter the results before providing the results to the vendor based on the access rights assigned to the vendor.","The above description is illustrative, and not restrictive. Many other embodiments will be apparent to those of skill in the art upon reviewing the above description.
