title: Methods and systems for storefront generation
abstract: A method and a system to generate mobile storefronts are described. The storefront application is executable by a user device to allow a user of the user device to access the storefront and purchase an item from a merchant. The system comprises an initialization module that provides an initialization interface to an identified merchant that is used to initialize creation of a storefront application. A storefront module provides a generation interface that receives, from the merchant, an appearance for the storefront application. An inventory module receives an inventory information describing items for sale. A policy module provides a policy interface that receives policies of the storefront. A platform module generates source code that when compiled, becomes the storefront application. The source code is generated based at least on one or more templates and the inventory.

{"@attributes":{"id":"description"},"BRFSUM":[{},{}],"heading":["TECHNICAL FIELD","BACKGROUND","DETAILED DESCRIPTION"],"p":["The present application relates generally to the technical field of data processing and, in one specific example, to generating a storefront.","Online merchants provide online stores where the merchants sell their goods to consumers. A merchant may set up a storefront accessible via a website or via an application. To provide an application, the merchant may have to hire a programmer or code the application himself.","Example methods and systems to generate a mobile storefront are described. In the following description, for purposes of explanation, numerous specific details are set forth in order to provide a thorough understanding of example embodiments. It will be evident, however, to one skilled in the art that the present invention may be practiced without these specific details.","Online merchants publish a mobile storefront where buyers can browse items for sale and purchase those items using a mobile device. The mobile device may be a smartphone, tablet, or other connected user devices such as a television set or set-top box. The systems and methods provided herein allow a merchant to generate a mobile storefront that can be downloaded by the user of the mobile device. In various embodiments, the merchant is automatically provided source code to modify, add-to, or publish directly to the users.",{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0017","num":"0016"},"figref":["FIG. 1","FIG. 1"],"b":["100","102","104","106","108","110","112"]},"An Application Program Interface (API) server  and a web server  are coupled to, and provide programmatic and web interfaces respectively to, one or more application servers . The application servers  host one or more marketplace applications  and payment applications . The application servers  are, in turn, shown to be coupled to one or more databases servers  that facilitate access to one or more databases . The application servers  may further host a generation system  that generates mobile storefronts.","The marketplace applications  may provide a number of marketplace functions and services to users that access the networked system . The payment applications  may likewise provide a number of payment services and functions to users. The payment applications  may allow users to accumulate value (e.g., in a commercial currency, such as the U.S. dollar, or a proprietary currency, such as \u201cpoints\u201d) in accounts, and then later to redeem the accumulated value for products (e.g., goods or services) that are made available via the marketplace applications . While the marketplace and payment applications  and  are shown in  to both form part of the networked system , it will be appreciated that, in alternative embodiments, the payment applications  may form part of a payment service that is separate and distinct from the networked system .","Further, while the system  shown in  employs a client-server architecture, the present invention is of course not limited to such an architecture, and may equally find application in a distributed, or peer-to-peer, architecture system, for example. The various marketplace and payment applications  and  may also be implemented as standalone software programs, which do not necessarily have networking capabilities.","The web client  accesses the various marketplace and payment applications  and  via the web interface supported by the web server . Similarly, the programmatic client  accesses the various services and functions provided by the marketplace and payment applications  and  via the programmatic interface provided by the API server . The programmatic client  may, for example, be a seller application (e.g., the TurboLister application developed by eBay Inc., of San Jose, Calif.) to enable sellers to author and manage listings on the networked system  in an off-line manner, and to perform batch-mode communications between the programmatic client  and the networked system .",{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0022","num":"0021"},"figref":"FIG. 1","b":["128","130","102","114","128","102","102"]},{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0023","num":"0022"},"figref":"FIG. 2","b":["200","200","132","200","200","200","200","200"]},"An initialization module  is configured to identify a merchant from among a plurality of merchants for whom to generate a storefront. The merchant may be identified using information provided by the merchant such as a login name, a token, a password, or the like. The merchant may, alternatively, be identified using other information such as a cookie, a device identifier, an IP address, or the like.","The initialization module  may further allow a merchant to establish one or more storefronts. The merchant may provide, via a user interface, a title to identify the storefront, a logo for the storefront, a currency accepted by the storefront, and a storefront status (e.g., open or closed). One example of an interface provided by the initialization module  is depicted in . The initialization module  may receive further information about the storefront such as, for example, seasonality, contact information, shipping location, acceptance of terms and conditions, reputation information of the merchant, billing information used to bill the merchant for the storefront, and the like.","A storefront module  is configured to allow the merchant to specify an appearance of the storefront via a generation interface provided by the storefront module . An example of a generation interface is depicted in . The storefront module  may receive a selection of a graphical theme for the storefront from a plurality of graphical themes. In some instances, the merchant may upload a graphical theme to the storefront module . A graphical theme specifies a layout of objects within an interface provided by the storefront to users. The objects may include a storefront title or logo, images of products for sale, product titles, product descriptions, menu layout, elements selectable by the user to perform various actions, and the like. In some instances, the merchant may customize a selected theme by, for example, changing fonts, changing text style or font size, changing pattern or texture, changing a background image, or the like. In some instances, the merchant may upload objects such as logos, images, or product descriptions via the generation interface.","An inventory module  is configured to receive and manage an inventory from the merchant that describes products for sale by the merchant. Examples of interfaces generated by the inventory module  are depicted in  and in FIG. . The inventory may be stored in an inventory database  for access by potential buyers and the merchant. In one embodiment, the inventory may be accessed by the inventory module  via an API (e.g., an API provided by the API server ) from the inventory database . In some embodiments, the inventory  may be accessed via an RSS feed or an upload of a spreadsheet. In some instances, a merchant may be able to edit, feature (i.e., showcase or highlight), or delete a product from the storefront. The inventory module  may provide default product settings changeable by the merchant for determining which products to feature on a home page of the storefront or for determining a course of action when one of the products sells out, when the quantity becomes too low, or if the product is not selling quickly.","A policy module  is configured to receive policies from the merchant that are enforced against the buyer. Examples of merchant policies may include pricing policies, dynamic pricing policies, shipping policies, payment policies, return policies, and the like. One example of an interface published by the policy module  directed to shipping policies is provided in . At least a portion of the policies may be received from the merchant in an \u201cif-then\u201d rule format.","A platform module  is configured to generate one or more executable applications based on the information provided by the merchant via the above described interfaces. The platform module  may generate source code, that when compiled, is executable within a particular mobile operating system. The source code includes human-readable program statements written in a high-level language that is not directly readable by a computer. When the source code is compiled into object code based on a selection of a platform or mobile operating system. Examples of platforms operating as mobile operating systems include iOS, Android, Windows Mobile, Blackberry, Palm, and the like. Other source code executable by more than one operating system, such as HTML code, may also be generated.","To generate the code, the platform module  may access one or more stored templates stored in a database such as templates database . The templates may include source code used to implement portions of the storefront. The templates may be separately generated for each platform. The source code within the templates is modifiable by the platform module . The platform module  may assemble and modify one or more of the stored templates to implement the storefront across multiple platforms as specified by the merchant. The template may be modified to include the merchant's selections. Based on the template selected by the platform module , the platform module  generates the source code of the application by mapping elements in the templates to modules of source code. For example, the inventory module may exist in the source code, fill in with the necessary inventory, and then be published to the merchant.",{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0031","num":"0030"},"figref":["FIG. 3","FIG. 3"],"b":["300","300","200","300","300","300"]},"In a step , the merchant is identified from among a plurality of merchants by, for example, the initialization module . Step  may further comprise receiving a selection of a storefront from among a plurality of storefronts already created by the merchant. For example, the merchant may provide a login mechanism which identifies the merchant or storefront to the system. In some instances, a merchant may request creation of a new storefront in the step . Alternatively, the merchant may change a status of, or edit, an existing storefront to \u201copen\u201d or \u201cclosed.\u201d One example interface for creating or modifying the storefront is shown in .","In a step , a generation interface is provided to the merchant by the storefront module . The generation interface allows the merchant to select the appearance of the storefront using, for example, the generation interface of . If the storefront is being created by the merchant, a graphical theme may be selected. If the storefront is being modified, the graphical theme may be modified by the merchant using the generation interface or a new graphical theme may be selected for the storefront. The merchant may provide or select one or more customizations to customize the graphical theme. A customization may include a background color, an accent or complementary color, a text color, font, a text style or size, or a background image.","In a step , an inventory interface (see, e.g., ) is provided to the merchant by the inventory module . The inventory interface may be configured to receive inventory information describing items for sale from the merchant. In some instances, the inventory may be accessed from a database maintained by the merchant, such as inventory  or another inventory database separate from the generations system . The inventory may be accessed via an API command, RSS feed, uploaded spreadsheet, or may be added item by item by the merchant (see, e.g., ). In instances where the merchant has more than one storefront, the inventory is associated with the storefront selected in step .","The inventory interface may further allow the merchant to provide one or more inventory settings. The inventory setting may include products that should be shown on an initial interface provided to the user when the application is first executed by the user (e.g., a \u201chome screen\u201d). The inventory setting may also comprise an action to perform if a particular item sells out, the quantity available becomes too low or if there is a surplus of the item.","In a step , a policy interface is provided to the merchant by the policy module . The policy interface allows the merchant to establish storefront policies. Examples of storefront policies include pricing policies, dynamic pricing policies, shipping policies, payment policies, return policies, and the like. An example of a policy interface targeted to shipping policies is provided in .","In a step , the source code is generated by the platform module . The source code, when executed on a user device, displays the storefront to the user and allows a user to bid on or purchase one or more items for sale using the user device. The source code is generated according to the input received from the merchant via the interfaces provided in steps , , and . The source code may be generated using one or more templates. More than one set of source code may be generated for the storefront. The sets of source code may be generated for various platforms of user devices.","In some instances, not all of the steps , , and  may be required. In those instances, pre-saved settings or default settings may be used to generate the source code.","In a step , the source code is provided to the merchant. The source code is editable by the merchant. After the source code is given to the merchant, the merchant may customize the source code to meet his needs or add add-ons (such as a tax-calculator service). The merchant may further compile the source code into an executable application and publish the executable application to one or more users. An executable application may be provided by the generation system  to the merchant.",{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0040","num":"0039"},"figref":"FIG. 4","b":["400","400","402","402","400","404","404","400"]},{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0041","num":"0040"},"figref":"FIG. 5","b":["500","500","502","500","504","504"]},{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0042","num":"0041"},"figref":"FIG. 6","b":["600","600","602","602"]},"The interface  also includes an inventory interface .

A module, engine, logic, component, or mechanism (collectively referred to as a \u201cmodule\u201d) may be a tangible unit capable of performing certain operations and configured or arranged in a certain manner. In certain example embodiments, one or more computer systems (e.g., a standalone, client, or server computer system) or one or more components of a computer system (e.g., a processor or a group of processors) may be configured by software (e.g., an application or application portion) or firmware (note that software and firmware can generally be used interchangeably herein as is known by a skilled artisan) as a module that operates to perform certain operations described herein.","In various embodiments, a module may be implemented mechanically or electronically. For example, a module may comprise dedicated circuitry or logic that is permanently configured (e.g., within a special-purpose processor, application specific integrated circuit (ASIC), or array) to perform certain operations. A module may also comprise programmable logic or circuitry (e.g., as encompassed within a general-purpose processor or other programmable processor) that is temporarily configured by software or firmware to perform certain operations. It will be appreciated that a decision to implement a module mechanically, in dedicated and permanently configured circuitry, or in temporarily configured circuitry (e.g., configured by software) may be driven by, for example, cost, time, energy-usage, and package size considerations.","Accordingly, the term \u201cmodule\u201d should be understood to encompass a tangible entity, be that an entity that is physically constructed, permanently configured (e.g., hardwired), or temporarily configured (e.g., programmed) to operate in a certain manner or to perform certain operations described herein. Considering embodiments in which modules or components are temporarily configured (e.g., programmed), each of the modules or components need not be configured or instantiated at any one instance in time. For example, where the modules or components comprise a general-purpose processor configured using software, the general-purpose processor may be configured as respective different modules at different times. Software may accordingly configure the processor to constitute a particular module at one instance of time and to constitute a different module at a different instance of time.","Modules can provide information to, and receive information from, other modules. Accordingly, the described modules may be regarded as being communicatively coupled. Where multiples of such modules exist contemporaneously, communications may be achieved through signal transmission (e.g., over appropriate circuits and buses) that connect the modules. In embodiments in which multiple modules are configured or instantiated at different times, communications between such modules may be achieved, for example, through the storage and retrieval of information in memory structures to which the multiple modules have access. For example, one module may perform an operation and store the output of that operation in a memory device to which it is communicatively coupled. A further module may then, at a later time, access the memory device to retrieve and process the stored output. Modules may also initiate communications with input or output devices and can operate on a resource (e.g., a collection of information).",{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0051","num":"0050"},"figref":"FIG. 10","b":"1000"},"The example computer system  includes a processor  (e.g., a central processing unit (CPU) a graphics processing unit (GPU) or both), a main memory  and a static memory , which communicate with each other via a bus . The computer system  may further include a video display unit  (e.g., a liquid crystal display (LCD) or a cathode ray tube (CRT)). The computer system  also includes an alphanumeric input device  (e.g., a keyboard), a cursor control device  (e.g., a mouse), a disk drive unit , a signal generation device  (e.g., a speaker) and a network interface device .","The disk drive unit  includes a machine-readable medium  on which is stored one or more sets of instructions (e.g., software ) embodying any one or more of the methodologies or functions described herein. The software  may also reside, completely or at least partially, within the main memory  and\/or within the processor  during execution thereof by the computer system , the main memory  and the processor  also constituting machine-readable media. The software  may further be transmitted or received over a network  via the network interface device .","While the machine-readable medium  is shown in an example embodiment to be a single medium, the term \u201cmachine-readable medium\u201d should be taken to include a single medium or multiple media (e.g., a centralized or distributed database, and\/or associated caches and servers) that storefront the one or more sets of instructions. The term \u201cmachine-readable medium\u201d shall also be taken to include any medium that is capable of storing, encoding, or carrying a set of instructions for execution by the machine and that cause the machine to perform any one or more of the methodologies of the present invention.
