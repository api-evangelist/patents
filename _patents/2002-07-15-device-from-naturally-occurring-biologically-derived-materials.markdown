No. PCT\/US02\/23189 filed Jul. 15, 2002, which claims the benefit of U.S. provisional applications Ser. Nos. 60\/305,786 and 60\/389,028 filed Jul. 16, 2001, and Jun. 14, 2002, respectively, and is related to U.S. application Ser. No. 10\/195,719 filed Jul. 15, 2002, which also claims the benefit of U.S. provisional applications Ser. Nos. 60\/305,786 and 60\/389,028 filed Jul. 16, 2001, and Jun. 14, 2002, respectively.","The present invention relates to devices for attaching, repairing or regenerating orthopedic tissue, particularly to such devices made from naturally occurring extracellular matrix cured or treated to have structural rigidity and hardness.","It is known to use various collagen scaffolds to provide a scaffold for repair and regeneration of damaged tissue. U.S. Pat. No. 6,042,610 to ReGen Biologics, hereby incorporated by reference, discloses the use of a device comprising a bioabsorbable material made at least in part from purified natural fibers. The purified natural fibers are cross-linked to form the device of U.S. Pat. No. 6,042,610. The device can be used to provide augmentation for a damaged meniscus. Related U.S. Pat. Nos. 5,735,903, 5,479,033, 5,306,311, 5,007,934, and 4,880,429 also disclose a meniscal augmentation device for establishing a scaffold adapted for ingrowth of meniscal fibrochondrocyts.","It is also known to use naturally occurring extracellular matrices (ECMs) to provide a scaffold for tissue repair and regeneration. One such ECM is small intestine submucosa (SIS). SIS has been described as a natural acellular biomaterial used to repair, support, and stabilize a wide variety of anatomical defects and traumatic injuries. See, for example, Cook\u00ae Online News Release provided by Cook Biotech Inc. at \u201cwww.cookgroup.com\u201d. The SIS material is derived from porcine small intestinal submucosa that models the qualities of its host when implanted in human soft tissues. Further, it is taught that the SIS material provides a natural scaffold-like matrix with a three-dimensional structure and biochemical composition that attracts host cells and supports tissue remodeling. SIS products, such as OASIS and SURGISIS, are commercially available from Cook Biotech Inc., Bloomington, Ind.","Another SIS product, RESTORE Orthobiologic Implant, is available from DePuy Orthopaedics, Inc. in Warsaw, Ind. The DePuy product is described for use during rotator cuff surgery, and is provided as a resorbable framework that allows the rotator cuff tendon to regenerate. The RESTORE Implant is derived from porcine small intestine submucosa, a naturally occurring ECM (composed of mostly collagen type I (about 90% of dry weight) glycosaminoglycans and other biological molecules), that has been cleaned, disinfected, and sterilized. During seven years of preclinical testing in animals, there were no incidences of infection transmission from the implant to the host, and the RESTORE Implant has not adversely affected the systemic activity of the immune system.","While small intestine submucosa is available, other sources of ECM are known to be effective for tissue remodeling. These sources include, but are not limited to, stomach, bladder, alimentary, respiratory, or genital submucosa, or liver basement membrane. See, e.g., U.S. Pat. Nos. 6,379,710, 6,171,344, 6,099,567, and 5,554,389, hereby incorporated by reference. Further, while SIS is most often porcine derived, it is known that these various submucosa materials may be derived from non-porcine sources, including bovine and ovine sources. Additionally, the ECM material may also include partial layers of laminar muscularis mucosa, muscularis mucosa, lamina propria, stratum compactum and\/or other tissue materials depending upon factors such as the source from which the ECM material was derived and the delamination procedure.","For the purposes of this invention, it is within the definition of a naturally occurring ECM to clean and\/or comminute the ECM, or to cross-link the collagen within the ECM. It is also within the definition of naturally occurring extracellular matrix to fully or partially remove one or more components or subcomponents of the naturally occurring matrix. However, it is not within the definition of a naturally occurring ECM to extract, separate and purify the natural components or sub-components and reform a matrix material from purified natural components or sub-components. Also, while reference is made to SIS, it is understood that other naturally occurring ECMs (e.g., stomach, bladder, alimentary, respiratory or genital submucosa, and liver basement membrane), whatever the source (e.g., bovine, porcine, ovine) are within the scope of this invention. Thus, in this application, the terms \u201cnaturally occurring extracellular matrix\u201d or \u201cnaturally occurring ECM\u201d are intended to refer to extracellular matrix material that has been cleaned, disinfected, sterilized, and optionally cross-linked.","The following U.S. patents, hereby incorporated by reference, disclose the use of ECMs for the regeneration and repair of various tissues: U.S. Pat. Nos. 6,379,710; 6,187,039; 6,176,880; 6,126,686; 6,099,567; 6,096,347; 5,997,575; 5,993,844; 5,968,096; 5,955,110; 5,922,028; 5,885,619; 5,788,625; 5,762,966; 5,755,791; 5,753,267; 5,733,337; 5,711,969; 5,645,860; 5,641,518; 5,554,389; 5,516,533; 5,445,833; 5,372,821; 5,352,463; 5,281,422; and 5,275,826. U.S. Pat. No. 5,352,463 discloses an SIS pillow filled with comminuted SIS for regeneration of a meniscus. While U.S. Pat. No. 5,352,463 contemplates the general concept of meniscus regeneration with an SIS filled pouch, it does not address itself to providing such a pouch having the capability of withstanding the compression and shear stresses involved in an implant for regenerating a meniscus. Also, U.S. Pat. No. 5,352,463 does not contemplate placing structural members formed from naturally occurring ECM, where in the ECM is right and hardened.","It is known to use materials such as catgut and SIS to make appliances. See WO 95\/06439 to Bolesky. The Bolesky application discloses devices that are semi-rigid and are formed into desired shapes, but Bolesky does not disclose a process for fabricating naturally occurring extracellular matrix parts that are rigid and hardened.","In the present invention, the density and porosity of the extracellular matrix material can be controlled with drying protocols, including air drying, air drying with heat, and air drying with pressure. Thus, the ECM material can be dried to have a hardness sufficient to machine the device, without the need to form the device into the general shape by molding. By managing density and porosity of the ECM, various fixation devices can be made having superior material properties, wherein the devices promote healing while remaining biocompatable and biodegradable.","The present invention, in one of its embodiments, is an orthopedic device for attaching soft tissue such as cartilage, ligaments, and tendons to bone. The device, which in one embodiment has a head end portion configured to engage soft tissue and a body portion configured to engage and attach to the bone, is preferably monolithic and formed as a unitary structure from naturally occurring extracellular matrix. The body portion of the device may illustratively terminate with a pointed end distal from the head portion to facilitate the penetration into the bone. Between the pointed distal end and the head portion, the device may illustratively be formed with radially outwardly extending barbs. These barbs may incline toward the head portion to provide a barbed tack or tack-like device. In some embodiments, a body portion is provided with diametrically opposed flats extending therealong, the flats being generally parallel.","It has been found that a mass of naturally occurring ECM may be cured to be very rigid and hardened so that it can be machined using conventional cutting tools and using laser machining. The devices of this invention may be formed by machining a mass of cured matrix to define the head portion and body portion. The mass may be formed by compressing the ECM into a solid mass. For example, the ECM may be comminuted and formed into a solid mass with interlocking strands of ECM.","For example, a tightly balled or compacted mass of pieces of SIS, illustratively comminuted SIS, can be formed by air drying or by hot air drying to become extremely hard. Unexpectedly, this hardened SIS can be machined or formed to have very sharp pointed ends, sharp barbs, etc. With this process, tacks, barbed tacks, and threaded elements may be machined from such cured mass of SIS. The tacks may be double-ended tacks or may include a central head portion and a sharpened body portion extending axially from each end of the head portion. Alternatively, a device may be made such that one body portion may be threaded while another body portion has barbs.","In one embodiment, such tacks or barbs may be attached to devices made of naturally occurring extracellular matrix laminated together to form a body portion. For example, such a body portion may be fabricated to be placed into the tear of a meniscus to extend along the tear. One or more tacks or barbs made in accordance with the present invention may be coupled to the body portion to secure the device in the tear. Each of these tacks may be made from naturally occurring extracellular matrix cured to be hard and rigid.","A staple or a staple-like device may be fabricated in accordance with the present invention utilizing two or more spaced apart barbs, each having a sharpened distal end and a proximal end. A connecting member may be placed between the proximal ends of the barbs. This connecting member may itself be made from a material such as SIS and optionally may be formed integrally with the barbs. Thus, in accordance with the present invention, an orthopedic staple device may be made from naturally occurring extracellular matrix hardened to have two or more sharpened barbs connected by strands of extracellular matrix such as SIS. In some embodiments of the present invention, such a staple or staple-like device may be made by laminating several layers of naturally occurring extracellular matrix and curing the layers to form a rigid and hardened sheet-like body. The barbs and the connecting member or members are then cut from the body. It has been found that the barbs and connecting member may be cut by laser machining a pattern on the sheet-like body. It has also been found that such barbs may be formed to have edges fused together by the laser machining process.","In another embodiment, a device for anchoring a bone plug in an opening formed in a bone is provided. The device comprises a mass of naturally occurring extracellular matrix formed into a rigid and hardened member configured to be wedged in the opening between the bone plug and the bone. This rigid and hardened member may be formed with outwardly extending barbs to dig into the bone plug and the bone. The device may also have a connecting portion to extend into an opening in the bone plug. In some embodiments, the member is designed to extend axially along side the bone plug, and the member may have a plurality of radially outwardly and longitudinally extending fins to dig into the bone plug and the bone. The elongated member may be cannulated so that it may be guided into place on a guide member such as a K-wire. In some embodiments, the member may be formed in the shape of a screw to be threaded into the opening between the bone plug and the bone.","There is provided, therefore, a method for anchoring a bone plug into an opening formed in a bone for receiving a plug, the method comprising the steps of providing a member formed into a rigid and hardened mass of naturally occurring extracellular matrix and placing the member into the opening between the bone and the bone plug. In some embodiments, the bone opening will be formed with a cylindrical wall and a bottom (or upper end) to receive a cylindrical bone plug, and the placing step will comprise placing the member in the bone plug to engage the bone plug and the bone. The member may be a double-ended tack, one end of which extends into the bottom of the opening and the other end of which extends into the bone plug. The double ended tack may radially expand the plug to engage the wall of the opening.","In another embodiment, a device for attaching a soft tissue such as a tendon, ligament, or ligament replacement has been provided. The device, which is formed from a hardened mass of naturally occurring extracellular matrix, is provided with an elongated body to be received in the opening in the bone. The body has a channel therein for receiving a portion of the soft tissue. This body is configured to collapse inwardly to grip and hold the soft tissue in the channel when the body is inserted into the opening. In some embodiments, the body may be threaded to accomplish inserting the device into the opening. It will be appreciated that such a device may be used for attaching an ACL replacement ligament in a tunnel formed in a femur, wherein the tunnel has an axis and a generally cylindrical wall. Such tunnel formation is known in the ACL replacement art. The body may be provided with a generally axial channel for receiving a portion of the ligament replacement to be attached to the femur, and the body may be formed to collapse inwardly to secure the replacement ligament portion in the channel as the device is threaded in the femur tunnel.","It will be appreciated that, in some embodiments, the naturally occurring extracellular matrix may be cured in such a fashion that the device will provide support structure members for various applications in the orthopedic field. For example, a device for regenerating a meniscus or a portion thereof may be provided with upper and lower panels and a support structure disposed between the upper and lower panels. This support structure may be provided by one or more members of rigid and hardened naturally occurring extracellular matrix. The one or more members may comprise a plurality of generally wedge-shaped members, each member having an upper edge supporting the upper panel and a lower edge supported on the lower panel. In other embodiments, the one or more support members may comprise a lattice of interlocking members, some of which extend radially toward the center of the knee and others of which extend transversely to the radially extending members. These members arranged in the lattice structure define a plurality of spaces between the upper and lower panel. These spaces may be filled with a biological material to promote regeneration of the meniscus. For example, the spaces may be filled with comminuted SIS, a bioactive agent, a biologically derived agent, cells, a biological lubricant, a biocompatible polymer, a biocompatible inorganic material, or combinations thereof. The ECM support structure is believed to provide a framework for meniscus generation. The insertion of the device into a space from which the defective portion of the meniscus has been removed and the attachment of the device to the surrounding tissue places the device such that the meniscus will be regenerated in the space from which the defective portion has been removed. The structural members provided by the rigid and hardened ECM will provide the required support for the joint while regeneration occurs.

The curing may be accomplished by air drying comminuted ECM at room temperature for several days. Comminuted ECM, when dried at room temperature for several days, becomes very tough and hard and can be machined using conventional tools. In one example, a sample of 3 cc of comminuted SIS that has been air dried at room temperature for several days produced a piece of SIS stock that is 7-8 mm in diameter and 2 mm thick, and has a hardness of about 70 HRD on the \u201cRockwell D\u201d scale. For comparison, polyethylene tests at about 30 HRD, and plexiglass is between 70 and 75 HRD on the \u201cRockwell D\u201d scale (ASTM D2240, Vol. 0991). Testing was done using an e2000 series durometer from PTC Instruments (model 502D). This durometer conforms to the ASTM D2240 type D standard. The indentor in this type (as in all durometers conforming to ASTM D2240 type D) is a sharp point indentor with a 30 degree included angle and applies a force of 4536 gmf on the sample being tested.","Thus, in an illustrated embodiment an orthopaedic device is formed from comminuted SIS that has been air dried at room temperature for several days. The SIS has a hardness of at least 30 HRD on the \u201cD\u201d scale, particularly at least 50 on the \u201cD\u201d scale, more particularly above 60 HRD on the \u201cD\u201d scale, and most particularly about 70 HRD or above on the \u201cD\u201d scale. A hardness of 60-70 is usable in many applications.","One sample of comminuted and air-dried SIS was found to have a density of 0.747+\/\u22120.059 gm\/cc. For comparison, the density of the commercially available RESTORE\u00ae product, an ECM laminate, is 0.466+\/\u22120.074 gm\/cc.

To have the bone plug anchored and secured to the wall of the bone opening, it is often necessary to force the bone plug against the wall of the opening in the host bone so that the required bone nourishment and eventual bone ingrowth may take place. This aspect of anchoring bone plugs to bone openings is well known in the orthopedic field. For example, in ACL surgery, it is known to anchor a bone plug harvested on the end of a patellar tendon strip in a tunnel formed upwardly into the femur. Essentially, the patellar tendon is harvested with a bone plug on one end of the strip. The other end may be provided with a bone plug as well. This patellar strip is then used as an ACL graft replacement. A tunnel is formed upwardly through a tibial platform into the femur and the ACL graft is secured in place by anchoring one of the bone plugs in the femur and the other of the bone plugs in the tibia. Conventionally, cannulated screws are threaded into the openings to extend alongside the bone plugs. These screws thread into the bone plugs and into the walls of the tunnels to push the plugs into engagement with the tunnel walls. The devices ,  are provided as alternatives to the threaded screws. These devices are pushed into the space between the exterior of a wall of the bone plug and the interior wall of the bone opening. Such a configuration is shown in  where the bone plug  is illustrated inserted into the opening or tunnel . Again, while the plug  is illustrated as having a cylindrical cross-section, it will be appreciated that the plug  will have a cross-sectional shape defined by the cutting tools used to remove the plug  from its original position. The device , however, will be inserted into the space between the plug  and the wall of the opening  to force the plug against the wall of the opening. It is understood that  shows only a portion of a ACL graft attached to the plug .","Referring to , it will be seen that a bone plug  may be secured in a tunnel  by barbed anchors . Each of these barbed anchors  may be formed from hardened naturally occurring ECM to have sharp barbs ,  with a connector portion  having a right angle extension  to be received into an opening  in the bone plug . Thus, the barbed anchors  may be attached to the bone plug  to extend along side the bone plug as it is inserted into the tunnel . An ACL graft may be attached to the bone plug  as indicated at .","The devices are made from ECM that has been cured to a hardness to allow machining. Each of these devices retains its structural integrity for a sufficient period of time to allow the intended orthopaedic fixation, and to permit bone or cartilage ingrowth or repair to begin. Preferably, the devices such as devices ,  and anchors  in  as well as the devices , , , , , , , , and  are designed to be absorbed into the host tissue, bone, or soft tissue into which they are placed.","Referring to , it will be seen that an orthopedic device  for attaching or repairing tissue is illustrated, the device  comprising two spaced apart barb portions , , each of which has a proximal end portion , a sharpened distal end portion , and at least one barb . The device  has a connecting member  extending between the proximal ends  to provide a staple-like device. Each of the barb portions ,  may be formed as previously discussed from hardened and rigid naturally occurring ECM. The entire device  may be machined from a single block of hardened ECM. Alternatively, barb portions ,  and connecting member  may be machined separately, and the connecting member  may have its ends inserted into and joined into the proximal end portions  of the barb portions as indicated at . Connecting member  may be affixed to the barb portions ,  in any number of ways, including threading or gluing at insertion . The device , therefore, may be used as a staple, for example, with the barb portions ,  inserted into the bone and the connecting member  holding tissue to the bone. The connecting member  may be formed from hardened naturally occurring ECM, flexible ECM, or another material.",{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0091","num":"0090"},"figref":"FIG. 27","b":["260","242","244","262"]},{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0092","num":"0091"},"figref":"FIG. 28","b":["270","272","274","276","270","278","270","272","274","273","270","275"]},{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0093","num":"0092"},"figref":["FIGS. 31 and 32","FIG. 32"],"b":["280","290","280","282","284","286","288","290","292","294","296","298","282","284","286","288","288","282","284","286","290","292","294","296","298","292","294","296"]},{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0094","num":"0093"},"figref":["FIG. 29","FIG. 29("],"b":["310","312","314","312","314","316","310","320","313","320","320","312","314","320","312","314","320","312","314","320","310","312","314","31","6","320","312","314","320","320"],"i":"a"},{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0095","num":"0094"},"figref":["FIG. 30","FIGS. 26 and 27"],"b":["340","320","320","340","250","240","260"]},"It is anticipated that the hardened ECM devices of the present invention can be combined with one or more bioactive agents (in addition to those already present in naturally occurring ECM), one or more biologically derived agents or substances, one or more cell types, one or more biological lubricants, one or more biocompatible inorganic materials, one or more biocompatible synthetic polymers and one or more biopolymers.
