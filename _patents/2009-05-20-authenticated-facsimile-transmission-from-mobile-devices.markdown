title: Authenticated facsimile transmission from mobile devices
abstract: A fax document can be either uploaded to a fax server in a vPBX network or generated dynamically. For dynamic generation, pre-configured templates can be stored either on a mobile device or on a fax server. A user can use a mobile device connected to a vPBX network as a controlling device to direct generation of faxes on a fax server. The generation of faxes can be customized based on a geographic location of the mobile device. The generated fax can be downloaded onto a mobile device. The user can digitally sign the fax using a touch-screen input device on the mobile device. The digitally signed fax can be transmitted to a destination device.

No. 61\/117,912, filed Nov. 25, 2008, the entire contents of which are hereby incorporated by reference.","This subject matter relates to facsimile transmission.","A private branch exchange (PBX) is a telephone network that serves a business or an office. A virtual PBX (vPBX) allows a business or office to be served by a PBX system hosted on remote servers. The service is provided through a combined voice network (e.g. telephone network) and data network (e.g. Internet). A vPBX typically involves one or more voice-over-IP (\u201cVOIP\u201d) servers, a call management program, a network, a gateway that links the voice network and data network, and one or more extensions. Conventional implementation of a vPBX system is not well suited for permitting mobile devices to send authenticated faxes.","Fax documents can be uploaded to a central fax server by a user or generated dynamically. For dynamic generation, pre-configured templates can be stored either on a mobile device or on a central fax server. A mobile device can be used as a controlling device to direct generation of fax documents on the fax server. The generated fax documents can be downloaded back to the mobile device, digitally signed using an input device (e.g., a touch input device), and sent out to a destination fax machine or other fax capable device (e.g., a computer coupled to a printer). Alternatively, full fax generation can take place directly on a mobile device, space and capacity permitting. Alternatively, a mobile device can upload a stored digital signature onto the server, where the stored digital signature is placed into a fax document upon user request. The assembled fax document can then be sent to a destination from the fax server.","In some implementations, a fax document can be uploaded to a fax server or generated dynamically on a fax server. Fax document templates can be stored on the fax server. A user can use a mobile device connected to a vPBX network as a controlling device to direct generation of fax documents from fax document templates on the fax server. The generation of fax documents can be customized to a user based on a geographic location of the user's mobile device. Generated fax documents can be downloaded onto a mobile device. A user can digitally sign the fax document using a touch-sensitive screen interface on the mobile device. The digitally signed fax can be transmitted from the fax server to a destination fax machine.","In some other implementation, fax document generation can take place on a mobile device. A user can download a fax document template from a fax server to a mobile device, create a fax document based on the template, sign the fax document, and transmit the signed fax document to a destination fax machine or other device capable of receiving an electronic fax. In another implementation, a mobile device can upload a stored signature onto a fax server, where the signature is placed into an assembled fax document. The assembled fax document is then sent to the destination from the fax server.","The details of one or more implementations of authenticated fax transmission from location-aware mobile devices are set forth in the accompanying drawings and the description below. Other features, objects, and advantages of the techniques will be apparent from the description and drawings, and from the claims.","A private branch exchange (\u201cPBX\u201d) is a telephone network system that servers a business or office, in contrast to a common carrier. A PBX system can include one or more VOIP servers, a call management program, and a gateway between data and voice network. A virtual PBX (vPBX) system is a PBX system whose VOIP servers, call management program, and gateway that are located remotely from the office or business, typically at a vPBX service provider. A mobile device is a portable computer device that can wirelessly connect to a data network or a voice network or both. A mobile device typically has a display screen or a keyboard, or both. A mobile device can be a cell phone, a personal digital assistant (PDA), a handheld device, etc. An extension is an internal device, such as a mobile device or landline phone, that is connected to a PBX system. The PBX system operates as a switchboard for the extensions. A user is a person who uses the vPBX system. A fax, or facsimile, is a telecommunication technology that transfer copies of documents over a packet (data) or switched (telephone) network. Unless otherwise specified, a sender is a person or device from whom or which a fax transmission originates, and receiver, or destination, is a person or device to whom or which a fax transmission is sent.",{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0019","num":"0018"},"figref":"FIG. 1","b":["100","130","102","104","106"]},"Further to , mobile device  can be configured to interact with a call control manager , over a call control communications channel, which in some implementations can be a broadband call control channel . In some implementations, broadband call control channel  can be established in network  (e.g., in the same or separate channel used to convey voice\/video data, such as in a Session Initiation Protocol (\u201cSIP\u201d) message). Note that in some implementations, another narrowband call control channel  can be established in network  (e.g., a mobile operator can provide in the same or separate channel used to convey voice\/video data, such as in an Short Message Service (\u201cSMS\u201d) message). Mobile device  and\/or call control manager  can be configured to establish narrowband  and\/or broadband  call control channels so mobile device  and\/or call control manager  can transmit and\/or receive call control data  (over the narrowband call control channel ) and\/or  (over the broadband channel ). Call control manager  can be configured to effect a number of call controlling functions that can be performed remotely from mobile device . Thus, call control manager  can perform call control operations in association with a first call from a phone  via network  and\/or a second call from a phone  via network  and\/or a second call from a phone  via a network . In one implementation, call control manager  can be disposed in a central office (\u201cCO\u201d). In another implementation, mobile device  includes an interface, such as a user interface , for facilitating generation, receipt, and processing, and management of call control data  and  for delivery over narrowband  and\/or broadband  call control channels. Interface  can be configured to implement the functionalities described therein, including receiving inbound calls, dialing outbound calls, and click to call generating a combined inbound and outbound call.","In at least some implementations, call control manager  includes a bridge manager , a configuration manager , and a repository (\u201cDB\u201d) . Bridge manager  can be configured to perform inbound call delivery, call routing, call transfer functions, conference call functions, and the like, for mobile device . Note that call control manager  provides for bridging calls generated by disparate telecommunications technologies associated with communications devices  and  and . For example, as an alternative to answering an inbound call on mobile device , the call can be recorded (such as voice mail) on mobile device  and\/or on the call control manager  and simultaneously reviewed on mobile device  via user interface . During call recording, the inbound call can be answered dynamically at mobile device  and\/or transferred to one or more of communications devices , , and . Completed recordings (e.g., announcements, voice mail, etc.) can be reviewed at mobile device  via user interface .","Configuration manager  can be configured to interact with a remote computing device  or with a mobile device  to receive configuration parameter data (\u201cconf param\u201d) . Further, configuration manager  can be configured to store configuration parameter data , and responsive to such data, call control manager  can be implemented by a user to control inbound calls before, during, or after reaching mobile device . Further, configuration manager  can be configured to store in database  audio files recorded via user interface  on device  and transmitted to call control manager  via narrowband  and\/or broadband  call control channels.",{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0023","num":"0022"},"figref":["FIG. 2","FIG. 1","FIG. 1","FIG. 1","FIG. 1","FIG. 1"],"b":["130","130","132","134","210","213","225","220","132","204","204","204","204","102","210","212","214","212","142","152","162","106","102","212","102","212","214","102","112","142","152","214","102","113","142","152","162","113","104","102","113","130","142","152","162","130"]},{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0024","num":"0023"},"figref":"FIG. 3","b":["300","102","302","304","306","302","304","306"]},"Sensors, devices, and subsystems can be coupled to the peripherals interface  to facilitate multiple functionalities. For example, a motion sensor , a light sensor , and a proximity sensor  can be coupled to the peripherals interface  to facilitate orientation, lighting, and proximity functions. Other sensors  can also be connected to the peripherals interface , such as a positioning system (e.g., GPS receiver), a temperature sensor, a biometric sensor, or other sensing device, to facilitate related functionalities.","A camera subsystem  and an optical sensor , e.g., a charged coupled device (\u201cCCD\u201d) or a complementary metal-oxide semiconductor (\u201cCMOS\u201d) optical sensor, can be utilized to facilitate camera functions, such as recording photographs and video clips.","Communication functions can be facilitated through one or more wireless communication subsystems , which can include radio frequency receivers and transmitters and\/or optical (e.g., infrared) receivers and transmitters. The specific design and implementation of the communication subsystem  can depend on the communication network(s) over which the mobile device is intended to operate. For example, a mobile device can include communication subsystems  designed to operate over a GSM network, a GPRS network, an EDGE network, a Wi-Fi or WiMax network, a 3-G network, and a Bluetooth\u2122 network. In particular, the wireless communication subsystems  can include hosting protocols such that the mobile device can be configured as a base station for other wireless devices.","An audio subsystem  can be coupled to a speaker  and a microphone  to facilitate voice-enabled functions, such as voice recognition, voice replication, digital recording, and telephony functions.","The I\/O subsystem  can include a touch screen controller  and\/or other input controller(s) . The touch-screen controller  can be coupled to a touch screen . The touch screen  and touch screen controller  can, for example, detect contact and movement or break thereof using any of a plurality of touch sensitivity technologies, including but not limited to capacitive, resistive, infrared, and surface acoustic wave technologies, as well as other proximity sensor arrays or other elements for determining one or more points of contact with the touch screen .","The other input controller(s)  can be coupled to other input\/control devices , such as one or more buttons, rocker switches, thumb-wheel, infrared port, USB port, and\/or a pointer device such as a stylus. The one or more buttons (not shown) can include an up\/down button for volume control of the speaker  and\/or the microphone .","In one implementation, a pressing of the button for a first duration can disengage a lock of the touch screen ; and a pressing of the button for a second duration that is longer than the first duration can turn power to the mobile device on or off. The user can be able to customize a functionality of one or more of the buttons. The touch screen  can, for example, also be used to implement virtual or soft buttons and\/or a keyboard.","In some implementations, the mobile device can present recorded audio and\/or video files, such as MP3, AAC, and MPEG files.","The memory interface  can be coupled to memory . The memory  can include high-speed random access memory and\/or non-volatile memory, such as one or more magnetic disk storage devices, one or more optical storage devices, and\/or flash memory (e.g., NAND, NOR). The memory  can store an operating system , such as Darwin, RTXC, LINUX, UNIX, OS X, WINDOWS, or an embedded operating system such as VxWorks. The operating system  can include instructions for handling basic system services and for performing hardware dependent tasks. In some implementations, the operating system  can be a kernel (e.g., UNIX kernel).","The memory  can also store communication instructions  to facilitate communicating with one or more additional devices, one or more computers and\/or one or more servers. The memory  can include graphical user interface instructions  to facilitate graphic user interface processing; sensor processing instructions  to facilitate sensor-related processing and functions; phone instructions  to facilitate phone-related processes and functions; electronic messaging instructions  to facilitate electronic-messaging related processes and functions; web browsing instructions  to facilitate web browsing-related processes and functions; media processing instructions  to facilitate media processing-related processes and functions; GPS\/Navigation instructions  to facilitate GPS and navigation-related processes and instructions; camera instructions  to facilitate camera-related processes and functions; and\/or other software instructions  to facilitate other processes and functions, e.g., access control management functions as described in reference to . The memory  can also store other software instructions (not shown), such as web video instructions to facilitate web video-related processes and functions; and\/or web shopping instructions to facilitate web shopping-related processes and functions. In some implementations, the media processing instructions  are divided into audio processing instructions and video processing instructions to facilitate audio processing-related processes and functions and video processing-related processes and functions, respectively. An activation record and International Mobile Equipment Identity (\u201cIMEI\u201d)  or similar hardware identifier can also be stored in memory .","Each of the above identified instructions and applications can correspond to a set of instructions for performing one or more functions described above. These instructions need not be implemented as separate software programs, procedures, or modules. The memory  can include additional instructions or fewer instructions. Furthermore, various functions of the mobile device can be implemented in hardware and\/or in software, including in one or more signal processing and\/or application specific integrated circuits.",{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0036","num":"0035"},"figref":"FIG. 4","b":["400","410"]},"A fax document template can contain formatting information and company specific information, such as a company logo, address, phone number, and boilerplate languages. A fax document template can also contain one or more placeholders for sender and receiver information, such as user name, position, and extension number. A fax document template can further contain metadata that can be use to configure a fax-sending device to control the fax sending process. For example, a fax document template can be configured to permit a sender to send a fax based on the template only after the fax is signed by a supervisor of the sender. A fax document template can also contain metadata that can disable some senders to send out faxes to some receivers, or to enable a fax to be automatically archived in an archiving system.","A fax document template can be created by a user on a mobile device. A user can use editing functions on a mobile device to create, edit, and delete a fax document template on the mobile device. A user can download and upload a fax document template from and to a fax server. The download and upload can be through Hypertext Transfer Protocol (\u201cHTTP\u201d) or other data transfer protocols. Alternatively, a user can use a mobile device as a terminal to create, edit, and delete fax document templates directly on a fax server. A fax document template can be given various levels of access limitations, such as \u201cprivate to the creator,\u201d \u201cavailable to a group,\u201d or \u201cavailable to all users\u201d in a vPBX network. A group can be configured to include one or more users in the vPBX network. An example group can be a bridged line appearance (BLA) group, an extension in which can display status of other extensions in the same group.","A fax document template can be stored on a fax server in a vPBX network. A fax server can be a fax manager  in a vPBX server . A fax server can also be a distinct, dedicated fax device in the vPBX network. The fax server can contain a repository for all fax document templates. A user with administrative authority can manage all templates in a repository through a mobile device. A user without administrative authority can manage templates created by the user, or templates that have access rights that permit the templates to be edited by the user.","In some implementations, a fax document template can be retrieved from a storage device to the memory of a user's mobile device. In some other implementations, a fax document template can be retrieved from a storage device to memory on a fax server. A mobile device can be configured to function as a remote control terminal of a fax server, performing administrative and editorial tasks on the fax server.","In a next step , a fax document is generated based on a fax document template identified in step . Generating a fax document can include inserting sender-generated content, inserting values to predefined fields in a fax document template and inserting fax content into a fax document template. Inserting values to predefined fields can include inserting a user's identity, phone extension number, and address.","To insert sender-generated content, a vPBX system can receive user input from a mobile device. A user can type text message on a keyboard on a mobile device, or by tapping a virtual keyboard displayed on a display screen. A user can also draw sketches on a touch-sensitive display screen. The user input can be transmitted to a vPBX server. After receiving the user input, the vPBX server can insert the received user input into predetermined fields of the fax document template.","To insert a user's identity values, a vPBX system can determine the user's identity by identifying the mobile device that has been assigned to a user, by requiring user authentication, or both. User authentication can include requiring a user to log in to the vPBX system with a user name and a password. The authentication can also include time and location based limitations, which will be described below. Login information and other authentication information can be transmitted in a secure communication channel. A wireless communication channel can be secured using various security protocols. For example, a wireless communication channel can be secured using a certification program such as Wi-Fi Protected Access (\u201cWPA\u201dand \u201cWPA2\u201d). As another example, an Internet protocol can be secured using Secure Sockets Layer (\u201cSSL\u201d).","To insert extension numbers, a vPBX system can select a number according to an extension number field in a fax document template. In some implementations, an extension number field can be configured to allow a vPBX server to insert the extension number of the mobile device from which the fax is sent. An extension number field can also be configured to allow a vPBX server to insert a main extension number of the sender. A vPBX server can determine a user's main extension number by querying a user contact information database. In some other implementations, a vPBX system can insert a main office number, or a primary line number of a bridged line appearance (\u201cBLA\u201d) group number.","To insert an address, a vPBX system can select an address according to an address field in a fax document template. In some implementations, an address field can be configured to allow a vPBX server to insert a main office address. A vPBX system can determine a user's office address by querying a user contact information database. In some other implementations, a PBX system can insert a current physical address of the sender. The current physical address of a user can be determined by a current geographic location of a location-aware mobile device and a geographic referencing system. A mobile device can be a location-aware mobile device when the mobile device is coupled with, or connected to, a positioning system such as a GPS. A vPBX server can track a mobile device's geographic location by retrieving the mobile device's geographic coordinates through an availability status manager . In yet some other implementations, a vPBX server can combine a current geographic location of the mobile device with a user contact information database. For example, a company can have an office in Boston, and another office in Dallas. A Boston office address can be entered into the fax document as sender address when the vPBX system determines that the mobile device is sending the fax from Boston, and otherwise, by default, a Dallas office address can be used.","The geographic coordinates of the mobile device can be determined in a variety of ways. For example, a GPS receiver integrated with, or coupled to, the mobile device can determine the physical location of the mobile device. A triangulation program can also determine the physical location of the device, by way of measuring the relative position of the mobile device against reference places with ascertained geographic positions, e.g., extremely low frequency (\u201cELF\u201d) and microwave (cellular phone) transmission towers. The relative position can be measured, for example, by calculating a time difference between the towers for receiving a signal from the mobile device. The triangulation program can operate on a server in a network to which the mobile device is connected. The triangulation program can also operate on the mobile device, by way of keeping a list of reference places one the mobile device.","The geographic coordinates can be mapped to a current physical address based on a mapping system that maps latitude-longitude coordinates with physical addresses. An example mapping system is the Topologically Integrated Geographic Encoding and Referencing system (\u201cTIGER\u201d) of the United Status Census Bureau. Another example mapping system can be Google Maps, which provides a Web based application programming interface (\u201cAPI\u201d) for identifying addresses based on geographic coordinates and identifying geographic coordinates based on addresses.","In addition to inserting values to fields in a fax document template, a sender can insert text into the fax document template in step . A sender can enter text into the fax document template that has been downloaded into memory on a mobile device. Entering text can include typing on a keyboard, tapping on a displayed keyboard on a touch-sensitive screen, or handwriting letters and characters on a free-hand writing area on the touch-sensitive screen. Alternatively, a user can use a mobile device as a remote terminal to enter text into the fax document template that has been loaded into memory on a fax server. Entering text can also include selecting from a collection of pre-entered text for one or more particular fields in the fax document template. The pre-entered text can include, for example, various versions of standard language for greetings, referencing subject matters, and disclaimers. Each version can be tailored for one or more specific fax recipients. The various versions of the pre-entered text or portions of the pre-entered text can be displayed on the touch-sensitive screen. A user can select a particular version of the text to enter into a field by, for example, tapping on the version of the text.","In a next step , a vPBX system can retrieve a user's signature from a mobile device. In many circumstances, a fax transmission requires a sender signature. In some example implementations, a user signs a fax by writing a signature on a touch-screen of a mobile device. The signature can be in a form of freehand drawing. A freehand drawing can be inserted into a signature area of a fax document template. In another example implementation, a user's freehand input on a mobile device can be used to identify the user. A vPBX server identifies a user by matching a signature with stored signature images or stored user names. Image comparison tools and character recognition and approximation methods can be used. An example mobile device that can receive freehand drawing as input and can map the freehand drawing input with stored character sets is an Asian character input system on an iPhone\u2122 made by Apple Inc., Cupertino, Calif. Once a vPBX server successfully maps a handwritten signature with a stored signature or a stored user, the vPBX server can insert the stored signature in the document.","In some other example implementations, a user can instruct a fax server to insert a signature into a fax document after electronically logging in to a vPBX system. A fax server can insert a pre-stored digital signature to an out-going fax after authenticating the user. An authentication can be through a username and password combination. An authentication can also include location-based identification in addition or as an alternative to username and password combination. For example, to authenticate a user, a vPBX server can require the input of a user name, a user password, and a user location. The user location can be determined by the geographic coordinates of the mobile device. A user is determined to possess signatorial authority only if the combination user name, password, and geographic coordinates of the mobile phone match a pre-determined combination.","In some implementations, a user can be authenticated by a user name and password combination only if the user is physically in office. A vPBX server can infer that a user is in office by determining that the user's mobile device is in the office. A vPBX server can determine that the user's mobile device is in office by matching geographic coordinates of the mobile device with a set of pre-stored geographic coordinates, which are designated as \u201coffice\u201d in a location database. In some other implementations, a user can be authenticated only during a pre-defined time window, e.g., 9 am to 5 pm. The time window requirement can be applied in addition to or independent from the geographic location of a mobile device to create enhanced security measure.","In a next step , an authenticated fax document is transmitted to one or more destinations. In some implementations, a fax server can send multiple faxes to multiple recipients. A fax server can send a fax to either a receiving device on Public Switched Telephone Network (\u201cPSTN\u201d) or a receiving device on an IP network.",{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0053","num":"0052"},"figref":["FIGS. 5A and 5B","FIG. 5A","FIG. 5A"],"b":["530","510","200","200","130","225","520","520","200","520","225","510","200","520","505","505"]},"In an example implementation, mobile device  retrieves fax document template  from a fax server  into the memory of mobile device . The retrieval of fax document template  can be a data transfer through HTTP protocol. The data transfer can be managed by the fax manager  in the vPBX server . After retrieving fax document template  from fax server , the vPBX system can permit a user to insert text in the fax document template . The vPBX system can insert some or all data fields in the fax document template . Alternatively or additionally, a user can insert some or all data fields in the fax document template , to generate a fax document .","A user can authenticate the fax document  by providing a signature. The signature can be a hand-written signature on a touch-sensitive screen on the mobile device . The signature can be inserted into the fax document  as an image. The signature can also be another form of electronic signature. The signed fax document can be sent to a destination device  either directly from mobile device  or from a fax manager  in vPBX server .","In one example implementation of sending authenticated faxes from a mobile device, mobile device  can send the signed fax document  to a destination fax machine . The sending of the fax document can be achieved by creating a virtual connection between mobile device  and destination fax machine . The connection can be managed by a vPBX server, through a telephony gateway server  (\u201cTGS,\u201d see  below).","In another example implementation of sending authenticated faxes from a mobile device, a user can send the signed fax document through a fax manager . In a first step, the fax document is sent from mobile device  to vPBX server through an Internet Message Access Protocol (IMAP), Post Office Protocol 3 (POP3), Simple Mail Transfer Protocol (SMTP), or other readily available messaging protocols. In a second step, fax manager  can perform record keeping tasks such as archiving the fax document, recording user information, recording billing information, etc. In a third step, fax manager  can send the fax to destination fax machine . The transmission between fax manager  and destination fax machine  can be through a messaging protocol or a fax over IP (FoIP) protocol, such as a T.38 fax relay standard.",{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0058","num":"0057"},"figref":"FIG. 5B","b":["510","200","520","505","520","510","520","530","510","225","200"]},"In some example implementations, mobile device  can act as a remote display device for fax server . Mobile device  can select a fax document template from a plurality of fax document templates stored on fax server . Mobile device  can instruct fax server  to load the selected fax document template to a memory area on fax server . Mobile device  can invoke a word processing program on either mobile device  or fax server  to edit the selected fax document template, including manually or automatically inserting values to data fields, inserting text, and inserting recipient name and number to generate a fax document . Mobile device  can authenticate fax document  by digitally signing fax document . The digital signature can be entered by a user on a touch-sensitive screen of mobile device . The digital signature can also be pre-stored on fax server . The digital signature can be inserted into the fax document  upon the fax server's authenticating a user's identity. The fax server  can authenticate a user's identity through a login process, whereupon a user enters a username\/password combination. The fax server  can also authenticate a user's identity by requiring the user's mobile device at a predefined geographic location, such as in office, or at a certain address. The fax server  can also authenticate a user's identity by applying a biometric security technology. For example, the fax server  can compare a user's voice with a stored voice sample; the fax server  can apply facial recognition technology on a self-portrait of a user, if the user's mobile device includes a real-time image capturing device such as a built-in camera; the fax server can also require a user to perform a pre-defined physical movement, such as waving a mobile device in a specific form, if the user's mobile device can sense motion; the fax server can also apply voice recognition technology, based on a voice capturing device integrated with or coupled to the mobile device (e.g., a microphone built in or connected to the mobile device).","Fax server  can archive the fax document  and send fax document  to a destination fax machine . Sending a fax document through a fax server , rather than from mobile device , can have an advantage of \u201csend and forget\u201d feature. Destination fax machine  can be busy or unavailable. A fax server  can be configured to implement re-dialing functions when fax machine  cannot receive a fax transmission. The re-dial function can attempt to resend the fax document  after preconfigured intervals, e.g., redial immediately, redial again after one minute, redial again after five minutes, etc. Fax server  can also create an error report after certain number of redials. The redial and error reporting functions on fax server  can be configured and controlled on mobile device . If the redial and error reporting functions are implemented on fax server , a user of mobile device  can \u201cforget\u201d the fax after the user presses a \u201csend\u201d button. The user can perform other functions on the mobile device  while the fax server  attempts resends.",{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0061","num":"0060"},"figref":"FIG. 5C","b":["520","520"]},"A vPBX database  supports the fax server . The database  can store fax server configuration, references to documents to be faxed, references to fax document templates, references to archives of faxed documents, and other fax related information. Database  can be implemented in a relational database management system (\u201cRDBMS\u201d), an object-oriented database system, or a plain file system. Database  is typically hosted by a database server, but can be hosted by a mobile device that has sufficient processing power and input\/output throughput, such as a mobile device on a G network.","A fax answering machine  (\u201cFAM\u201d) handles fax queues. A FAM  is a program that runs on one or more computers. When running on a Windows based computer, a FAM  can be implemented as a Windows Service. When running on a UNIX based computer, a FAM  can run as a cron job. A fax queue is a collection of fax documents that are ready to be sent to recipients. A fax document enters the queue when a user on a mobile device taps \u201cSend\u201d button on a mobile device. A FAM  can also resend a fax at given intervals when one or more prior attempts to send fail. Further, a FAM  can be configured to send fax documents at predetermined time. Such fax sending jobs can be implemented on a UNIX based system as cron jobs. A FAM  can be configured to send a single fax document to a large number of recipients. A FAM  can be linked to the database  using various database interfaces. For example, if database  is implemented using an Oracle database, such as Oracle 10g, the link between FAM  and the Oracle database can be based on Oracle Call Interface (\u201cOCI\u201d).","A Telephony Gateway Server  (\u201cTGS\u201d) executes requests from FAM . A TGS  can make outbound calls, download or upload files to and from a massages server  (\u201cMSGS\u201d), and send faxes. The TGS can be connected to a switched network (e.g., a telephone network), and therefore can be a \u201cgateway\u201d between a packet network and the switched network. A TGS  communicates with a FAM  using a telephony gateway interface (\u201cTGI\u201d), which can be a protocol of communication between TGS  and FAM .","An MSGS  can store messages. Messages can be voice messages or data messages (such as a fax document). For example, MSGS  can physically store documents to be faxed, fax document templates, and archives of faxed documents. The references to the document stored on MSGS  can be stored in the vPBX database . The TGS  can communicate with the MSGS  via a variety of protocols, such as HTTP.",{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0066","num":"0065"},"figref":["FIGS. 6A and 6B","FIG. 6A"],"b":["600","610"]},"A user can create a signature image on the fly in a variety of ways. For example, on a mobile device that has a touch-screen input device, a user can create a signature image by writing on the touch-screen with a stylus or with a finger. A signature image is generated by tracing the movement of the stylus or the user's finger on the touch screen interface of the mobile device. For a mobile device that is integrated with or coupled to a motion-sensing device such as a gyroscope or an accelerator or both, a user can wave the mobile device and draw a signature in the air. A mobile device can detect the user's hand movement with the motion-sensing device and create a signature based on the user's hand movement. A signature image is generated by tracing the mobile device's waving motion.","In a next step , a mobile device proportionally resizes the signature image to a standard signature size. The standard size can be pre-defined in a fax document template, where a signature field's geometry can be specified. A signer can also create, edit, or delete a standard size, for example, by dragging and resizing a signature image on the display screen of the mobile device.","In a next step , a mobile device or a fax server inserts the signature into the fax document. The signature can be at a fixed position in the fax document, or can be in a \u201cfloating\u201d position, when a user drags-and-drops the signature image to a place. The fixed position or floating position can be defined in a fax document template. The insertion of a signature image can differ from insertion of a regular image. An insertion of a signature can \u201clock\u201d a fax document. Locking a fax document disables further modification of data and text fields in the fax document. If a user attempts to edit a fax document after the user signs the fax document, the user's previous signature can be removed. The user is required to sign the fax document again before transmission. If a user other than the user has signed a fax document, the user's editing of the fax document is disabled. The user can add the user's own signature to a fax document after another user has signed the fax document if multiple-signature function is configured for the fax document. Multiple-signature functions can be implemented on a fax manager , and managed by a mobile device.","In , in an example process , a vPBX server can insert a pre-generated signature into a fax document after authenticating a user. The actual signature inserted by process  can visually differ from a signature image entered by a user. The example implementation illustrated in  can be useful when a standard signature needs to be inserted into a fax document. For example, a standard signature can include anti-counterfeit lines in addition to a signer's free-hand signature, which can be short, wavy, and multi-colored lines surrounding a free-hand signature. A standard signature can also include a company seal.","In step , a vPBX server receives a user's signature as an image. A user can enter a signature on a touch-sensitive screen of a mobile device through a signature-input user interface or by waving a mobile device that is integrated with or coupled to a motion-sensing device. Instead of using the received signature as a signature image to insert into a fax document, a vPBX server can use the received signature as a way to authenticate the user, before inserting a pre-stored signature image into the fax document.","In a next step , the vPBX server authenticates a signer by analyzing the received signature image. The authentication can determine that the signer is a person that the signer claims to be. Although a vPBX server can have knowledge on which extension (and which mobile device) is assigned to which user, it is possible that another user is using the device to sign a fax document. Therefore, the vPBX server can have a feature to further authenticate the sender by signature. A user's signature image is compared with an image stored on a fax server. The comparison can be implemented by various available image comparison or signature recognition processes. An existing signature recognition process can include the steps of feature extraction, element comparison, signature score calculation, etc.","In a next step , a vPBX server can determine whether the signer, authenticated, is authorized to send a fax a document. A list of persons authorized to send a fax document is stored in a fax server. The list of persons can be associated with other data in the fax server to provide restrictions on fax transmissions. Some example restrictions can be: a certain user can only send fax transmissions to a list of destination numbers; a certain user is associated with certain billing accounts; a certain user can only send fax transmissions from authorized locations, etc. A vPBX server can enforce an authorized location rule by permitting a mobile device to send a fax only when the mobile device's current geographic location is at a pre-defined location. The mobile device's current geographic location can be retrieved from a positioning system to which the mobile device is attached or connected.","A next step  can be inserting a stored signature image into a fax document. The signature image can be either the signature images received in step , or another signature image stored on a fax server. Step  can allow a vPBX fax server to insert a signature to a plurality of fax documents without a user having to sign each fax document individually.",{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0075","num":"0074"},"figref":"FIG. 7","b":["700","740","740","740","710","710","710"]},"Touch-sensitive screen  can display a signature input area . A user can provide a hand written signature by signing in the signature input area  with a finger, a touch stylus pen, or any other device that can draw on a touch-sensitive screen or device. A user can also provide a handwritten signature by other means. For example, if a mobile device is coupled with or is connected to a motion sensor, a user can create a signature by waving the mobile device. The motion sensor can track the movement. A program running on the mobile device or on a vPBX server can generate a signature image based on the tracked movement. After signing the user's name, the user may tap cancel button  to cancel the signature, or tap the sign button  to enter the signature into the fax document.","If a fax document contains a pre-defined signature area , the user's signature in signature box is scaled to the size of the signature area  and entered into the signature area , upon the user's tapping the sign button .","If a fax document does not contain a pre-defined signature area, the mobile device can create an image in the fax document box  upon the user's tapping the sign button . The user can resize the image, and drag the image to a place in the fax document box .","The effect of inserting a signature image into a fax document can differ from inserting non-signature images. Inserting a signature image by tapping a sign button can create a lock on the fax document. The lock can prevent the fax document from further modification. The lock can be stored as part of the document, or separately in a database in a vPBX server, associated with an index to the document. If a fax document signer edits the fax document after signing, the signer is prompted to either discard the editing, or invalidate the signer's prior signature. If a user who is not a signer edits a fax document that has been signed by a first signer, the user's editing of the fax document can be disabled.","After a user's signature is inserted in signature area , the user can either cancel the fax document by tapping a cancel button , or send the fax document by tapping a send button . A fax document template can specify that signature is required for the fax to be sent. If a user is using a \u201csignature required\u201d fax document template, the send button  can be disabled until the user signs the fax document. After sending the document, the user cannot further modify the document or invalidate the user's own signature.","The described features can be implemented advantageously in one or more computer programs that are executable on a programmable system including at least one programmable processor coupled to receive data and instructions from, and to transmit data and instructions to, a data storage system, at least one input device, and at least one output device. A computer program is a set of instructions that can be used, directly or indirectly, in a computer to perform a certain activity or bring about a certain result. A computer program can be written in any form of programming language (e.g., Objective-C, Java), including compiled or interpreted languages, and it can be deployed in any form, including as a stand-alone program or as a module, component, subroutine, or other unit suitable for use in a computing environment. A computer program can be stored on a computer-readable medium or a storage device.","Suitable processors for the execution of a program of instructions include, by way of example, both general and special purpose microprocessors, and the sole processor or one of multiple processors or cores, of any kind of computer. Generally, a processor will receive instructions and data from a read-only memory or a random access memory or both. The essential elements of a computer are a processor for executing instructions and one or more memories for storing instructions and data. Generally, a computer will also include, or be operatively coupled to communicate with, one or more mass storage devices for storing data files; such devices include magnetic disks, such as internal hard disks and removable disks; magneto-optical disks; and optical disks. Storage devices suitable for tangibly embodying computer program instructions and data include all forms of non-volatile memory, including by way of example semiconductor memory devices, such as EPROM, EEPROM, and flash memory devices; magnetic disks such as internal hard disks and removable disks; magneto-optical disks; and CD-ROM and DVD-ROM disks. The processor and the memory can be supplemented by, or incorporated in, ASICs (application-specific integrated circuits).","To provide for interaction with a user, the features can be implemented on a computer having a display device such as a CRT (cathode ray tube) or LCD (liquid crystal display) monitor for displaying information to the user and a keyboard and a pointing device such as a mouse or a trackball by which the user can provide input to the computer.","The features can be implemented in a computer system that includes a back-end component, such as a data server, or that includes a middleware component, such as an application server or an Internet server, or that includes a front-end component, such as a client computer having a graphical user interface or an Internet browser, or any combination of them. The components of the system can be connected by any form or medium of digital data communication such as a communication network. Examples of communication networks include, e.g., a LAN, a WAN, and the computers and networks forming the Internet.","The computer system can include clients and servers. A client and server are generally remote from each other and typically interact through a network. The relationship of client and server arises by virtue of computer programs running on the respective computers and having a client-server relationship to each other.","A number of implementations of the invention have been described. Nevertheless, it will be understood that various modifications can be made without departing from the spirit and scope of the invention.
