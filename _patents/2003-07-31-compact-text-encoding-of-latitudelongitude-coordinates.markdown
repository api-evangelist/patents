title: Compact text encoding of latitude/longitude coordinates
abstract: Methods are disclosed for encoding latitude/longitude coordinates within a URL in a relatively compact form. The method includes converting latitude and longitude coordinates from floating-point numbers to non-negative integers. A set of base-N string representations are generated for the integers (N represents the number of characters in an implementation-defined character set being utilized). The latitude string and longitude string are then concatenated to yield a single output string. The output string is utilized as a geographic indicator with a URL.

More particularly, the present invention relates to a method of encoding latitude and longitude coordinates in a Uniform Resource Locator (URL) associated with a web page.","Certain web sites, such as those that involve serving up maps of arbitrary locations, require an encoding of latitude\/longitude coordinates. There are at least two ways to accomplish the encoding. One is to provide the coordinates in a URL that is utilized to access a web page that is specifically related to the coordinates. The other way is to include the coordinates in a server-side persistent state, relying on a \u201csession\u201d with the user. The former approach has advantages over the latter, in that it requires significantly less infrastructure on the server side, and provides additional conveniences to users such as the ability to bookmark map pages. However, URLs are subject to significant length constraints, particularly in association with mobile devices. It is advantageous for URLs to be as short as possible, and preferably be human-typeable.","A point on the earth's surface is commonly represented by a pair of floating-point numbers, namely, numerical representations of latitude and longitude. A common representation of such numerical values in computer applications is in decimal degrees. A 1-degree arc of the earth's surface is roughly 110,000 meters long. This means that each latitude and longitude coordinate value must extend to five decimal places in order to yield roughly a 1-meter accuracy of representation. Thus, a typical text representation of latitude\/longitude coordinates in the context of a computer application (i.e., encoded within a URL) might look something like:\n\n","In this representation, longitude and latitude are listed with a separator character (,) between them. The representation requires 19 characters to indicate the longitude\/latitude position. Because it is desirable to keep URLs as short as possible, it would be beneficial to represent the same type of position information, to approximately the same accuracy, using a smaller number of characters.","Embodiments of the present invention pertain to a method for encoding latitude\/longitude coordinates within a URL in a relatively compact form. The method includes converting latitude and longitude coordinates from floating-point numbers to non-negative integers. A set of base-N string representations are generated for the integers. (N represents the number of characters in an implementation-defined character set being utilized). The latitude string and longitude string are then concatenated to yield a single output string. The output string is utilized as a geographic indicator within a URL. To decode an output string to its corresponding latitude\/longitude coordinates, the steps are inverted and performed in reverse order.","I.

Overview of Coordinate Consolidation","As has been discussed above, web sites that provide access to geographic-oriented applications and\/or information (i.e. sites that involve serving up maps of arbitrary locations) are particularly effective when specific latitude\/longitude coordinates are directly imbedded in URLs utilized to access web pages. As has been discussed, however, URLs are subjected to significant length constraints.","A concise and effective technique for representing coordinates associated with a point on the earth's surface to an arbitrary accuracy will illustratively be subject to the following constraints:\n\n","A point on the earth's surface is commonly represented by a pair of floating-point numbers, namely, numerical representations of latitude and longitude. A common representation of such numerical values in computer applications is in decimal degrees. A 1-degree arc of the earth's surface is roughly 110,000 meters long. This means that each latitude and longitude coordinate value must extend to five decimal places in order to yield roughly a 1-meter accuracy of representation. Thus, a typical text representation of a latitude\/longitude coordinate in a URL might look something like:\n\n","In this representation, longitude and latitude are listed with a separator character (,) between them.

As is indicated by block , the first step in the method is to convert latitude and longitude coordinates from floating-point numbers to non-negative integers. As will be described in relation to , to support the conversion, a system of mapping is illustratively utilized that generally preserves a desired level of accuracy. In accordance with block , the next step is to generate base-N string representations for the integers, where N represents the number of characters in an implementation-defined character set being utilized. In accordance with block , the final step is to concatenate the latitude string and longitude string so as to yield a single output string.",{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0048","num":"0052"},"figref":["FIG. 6","FIG. 5"],"b":["602","604","606"]},"V. Coordinate Consolidation in Detail",{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0049","num":"0053"},"figref":["FIG. 7","FIG. 5"]},"In accordance with block , the first step in the method is to select a character set. The particular set of characters to be utilized is adjustable and can be selected to accommodate a particular implementation. For example, if a particular implementation involves converting latitude\/longitude coordinates into a condensed parameter for incorporation into a URL, one might choose the following character set:\n\n","The larger the number of characters in the set, the more compact the resulting coordinate string will be. In other words, the length of the representation is inversely proportional to the logarithm of the number of characters. The example character set above is advantageous in that it uses a fairly large number of characters (all numerals and most letters). The set deliberately omits vowels to avoid the possibility of the algorithm inadvertently generating real words that could be offensive. The letter  has also been omitted to avoided possible confusion with the number 1. The example character set also uses lower-case letters only in order to make generated strings more human-friendly to type. For example, any capital letters entered by the user can be converted to lower case letter before decoding the coordinate string. Another advantage of the character set above is that it only includes characters that can be transmitted freely, and does not include characters that are excluded by certain encoding algorithms such as UUencoding.","In accordance with block , the next step is to choose a desired level of accuracy. The accuracy of a resulting coordinate representation is illustratively adjustable and can be selected to accommodate a particular implementation. A given implementation will have a certain requirement for how accurate string representations must be. The question becomes, if one were to take a pair of full double-precision, floating-point numbers representing latitude and longitude, convert them to a compact string representation using the techniques outlined herein, then convert the string representation back into double-precision, floating-point numbers, what is the maximum allowable error? The smaller the allowable error, the longer the string representations of coordinates should be. String length is inversely proportional to the logarithm of the allowable error.","In order to facilitate description of embodiments of the present invention, it will be assumed that an accuracy of 2 meters is required in the context of subsequent examples.","In accordance with block , the next step in the method is to calculate the number of digits required per coordinate. For a given character set (step ) and required accuracy (step ), we can calculate the number of digits required to represent a latitude or longitude:\n\nceiling[()\/()]\u2003\u2003Eq. 1\n\nwhere D is the number of digits required, Cis the circumference of the earth, Lis the allowed error size, and N is the number of characters in the set. The term \u201cceiling\u201d represents the \u201csmallest integer greater than or equal to\u201d.\n","In the presently running example, Lis 2 meters and N is 30 characters. Using a value of 4.0024\u00d710meters for C, this yields a value of 5 for D.","In accordance with block , the next step is to calculate the size of an integer mapping range. Latitudes and longitudes will illustratively be mapped to a range of integers in the range of 0 to M (inclusive), where M is calculated as follows:\n\n\u22121\u2003\u2003Eq. 2\n\nwhere N and D are defined in step . In the context of the presently running example, N is 30 and D is 5, so the resulting value of M is 24,299,999.\n","It should be noted that steps  through  need be performed only once for a given application. In contrast, steps  through  are performed for each latitude\/longitude coordinate pair that requires encoding.","In accordance with block , the first step in the conversion of a latitude\/longitude coordinate pair is to convert floating-point latitude and longitude strings to integers. Given a floating-point latitude (in the range of \u221290 to +90) and longitude (in the range of \u2212180 to +180), the floating-point strings are converted to integers.

Utilizing this as the numeric set of digits, the integer values are represented in base-N notation. The number of required digits D was determined in step .

Latitude and longitude is simply one common implementation of a spatial coordinate system within the scope of the present invention.
