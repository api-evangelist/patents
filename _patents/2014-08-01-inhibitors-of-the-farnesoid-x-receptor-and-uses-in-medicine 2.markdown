PEN04451 and PEN04607, awarded by the United States Department of Agriculture. The Government has certain rights in the invention.","Obesity has reached epidemic proportions worldwide and is associated with chronic diseases such as type 2 diabetes mellitus, cardiovascular diseases, hepatosteatosis, and cancer. Obesity develops as a result of energy intake that exceeds energy expenditure, leading to a net storage of excess calories in the form of fat in adipose tissue. Obesity is metabolically linked with type 2 diabetes (insulin resistance) and hepatosteatosis, the latter of which can lead to steatohepatitis, hepatocarcinogenesis and liver failure. Thus, a pharmaceutical approach that suppresses appetite, blocks dietary fat absorption, induces fat mobilization, or increases metabolism would be ideal in the treatment of obesity and related metabolic disorders.","Farnesoid X Receptor (FXR) is an orphan nuclear receptor initially identified from a rat liver cDNA library (Forman, et al., 81:687-693, 1995) that is most closely related to the insect ecdysone receptor. FXR is a member of the nuclear receptor superfamily of transcription factors that includes receptors for the steroid, retinoid, and thyroid hormones (Mangelsdorf, et al., 83:841-850, 1995). Northern blotting and in situ hybridization analysis showed that FXR is most abundantly expressed in the liver, intestine, kidney, and adrenal (B. M. Foinian, et al., 81:687-693.1995; Seol, et al., 9:72-85, 1995). FXR is a ligand-activated nuclear receptor that binds to DNA as a heterodimer with the retinoic acid receptor \u03b1 (RXR\u03b1) that is activated by the vitamin A derivative 9-cis retinoic acid. The FXR\/RXR\u03b1 heterodimer preferentially binds to response elements composed of two nuclear receptor half sites of the consensus AG(G\/T)TCA organized as an inverted repeat and separated by a single nucleotide (IR-1 motif) (Forman, et al., 81:687-693, 1995). An early report showed that rat FXR is activated by micromolar concentrations of farnesoids such as farnesol and juvenile hormone thus accounting for the original name (Forman, et al., 81:687-693, 1995). However, these compounds were weak ligands and also failed to activate the corresponding mouse and human FXR, leaving the nature of the endogenous FXR ligand in doubt. However, several naturally-occurring bile acids were found to bind to and activate FXR at physiological concentrations (Makishima, et al., 284:1362-1365, 1999; Parks, et al., 284:1365-1368, 1999; Wang et al., 3:543-553, 1999; PCT WO 00\/37077, published Jun. 29, 2000). The bile acids that serve as FXR ligands include chenodeoxycholic acid (CDCA), deoxycholic acid (DCA), lithocholic acid (LCA), and the taurine and glycine conjugates of these bile acids.","Bile acids are cholesterol metabolites that are formed in the liver and secreted into the duodenum of the intestine, where they have important roles in the solubilization and absorption of dietary lipids and vitamins. About 95% of bile acids are subsequently reabsorbed in the ileum and returned to the liver via the enterohepatic circulatory system. The conversion of cholesterol to bile acids in the liver is under feedback regulation, and bile acids down-regulate transcription of cytochrome P450 7A1 (CYP7A1), which encodes the enzyme that catalyzes the rate-limiting step in bile acid biosynthesis. FXR is involved in the repression of CYP7A1 expression by bile acids through an indirect mechanism involving the FXR target gene small heterodimer partner (SHP) and liver receptor homolog 1 (Goodwin et al., 6:517-528, 2000; reviewed in Matsubara et al., 368:17-29, 2013). In the ileum, in an FXR dependent manner, bile acids induce the expression of the intestinal bile acid binding protein (IBABP), a cytoplasmic protein which binds bile acids with high affinity and may be involved in their cellular uptake and trafficking. Two groups have now demonstrated that bile acids mediate their effects on IBABP expression through activation of FXR, which binds to an IR-1 type response element that is conserved in the human, rat, and mouse IBABP gene promoters. Thus, FXR is involved in both the stimulation (IBABP) and the repression (CYP7A1) of target genes involved in bile acid and cholesterol homeostasis. FXR also induces expression of the bile salt export pump (BSEP, ABC11) that transports unconjugated and conjugated bile acids\/salts from hepatocyte into the bile (reviewed in Matsubara et al., 368:17-29, 2013).","Tempol (4-hydroxy-2,2,6,6,-tetramethylpiperidine-1-oxyl), an antioxidant and a radiation protector, was reported to prevent obesity in mice (Mitchell et al., 34: 93-102, 2003). A recent mass spectrometry-based investigation revealed that tempol can affect fatty acid metabolism and the altered levels of suspected gut microbe-generated metabolites provided initial clues that tempol may alter the microbiome (Li et al., 12:1369-1376, 2013). Previous studies demonstrated that the alteration of the gut microbiome can affect the level of bile acids in liver, heart, and kidney (Swann et al., 108:4523-4530, 2011). High fat diets can induce changes in the expression of genes in the small intestine that are controlled by nuclear receptors including FXR (de Wit et al., 1:14, 2008). Thus, there may be relationship between altered bile acids in the intestine and FXR signaling that can alter high fat diet-induced obesity. While there are known natural and synthetic FXR agonist, no therapeutic agents have been disclosed which antagonize FXR. Recent studies revealed that the secondary bile acid tauro-\u03b2-muricholic acid (T\u03b2MCA) can antagonize bile acid signaling in the intestine (Sayin et al., 225-235, 2013; Li et al., 4:2384, 2013). Trisubstituted-pyrazol carboxamide analogs have been synthesized that are FXR antagonist, but their effect on metabolism and physiology were not investigated (Yu et al., 2919-2938, 2014).","Non-alcoholic fatty liver disease (NAFLD) is characterized by massive ectopic triglyceride (TG) accumulation in the liver in the absence of other liver disease or significant alcohol consumption (Wei\u03b2 et al., 2014; 111:447-452, 2014). NAFLD is the most common liver disorder affecting 20-30% of the adult population and more than 80% of obese people in the world. NAFLD can develop into nonalcoholic steatohepatitis (NASH), fibrosis, cirrhosis and even hepatocellular carcinoma (Browning et al., 114:147-152, 2004). As a component of metabolic syndrome, NAFLD is tightly associated with obesity, insulin resistance\/type 2 diabetes, and coronary heart disease and atherosclerosis (Bhatia et al., 33:1190-1200, 2012). To date, the underlying molecular mechanism of NAFLD development remains largely unknown and the identification of novel targets for NAFLD therapy is of high priority.","The foregoing shows that there is an unmet need for antagonists of the FXR receptor and a method of treating obese patients to induce weight loss, insulin resistance, and NAFLD.","The present invention provides inhibitors of the nuclear receptor farnesoid X receptor for treating or preventing obesity in mammals, particularly humans. Compounds embodying aspects of the invention inhibit the farnesoid X receptor and affect high fat diet-induced obesity through signal transduction mediated by the farnesoid X receptor. In accordance with the invention, the present invention provides compositions comprising these compounds and methods of using these compounds as therapeutic agents in the treatment or prevention of obesity.","The invention also provides a pharmaceutical composition comprising a compound or salt embodying the principles of the invention and a pharmaceutically acceptable carrier.","The invention further provides a method of inhibiting a farnesoid X receptor in a mammal, comprising administering to a mammal in need thereof a compound embodying the principles of the invention or a pharmaceutically acceptable salt thereof.","The invention additionally provides a method for treating or preventing obesity in a mammal, comprising administering to a mammal in need thereof a compound embodying the principles of the invention or a pharmaceutically acceptable salt thereof.","The invention also provides a method for treating or preventing obesity, insulin resistance and NAFLD in a mammal in need thereof, comprising administering to the mammal a compound embodying the principles of the invention or a pharmaceutically acceptable salt thereof. Desirably, the compounds inhibit the farnesoid X receptor in the intestine and affects obesity, insulin resistance and NAFLD through signal transduction mediated only by the intestinal farnesoid X receptor and not by the liver farnesoid X receptor. Preferably, the compounds have minimal systemic bioavailability so that the compounds do not inhibit the liver farnesoid X receptor which minimizes any systemic toxicity.","The invention further

Accordingly, there is a wide variety of suitable formulations of the pharmaceutical composition of the present invention. In certain embodiments, the formulation is suitable for administration to the alimentary tract, and in particular, to the small intestine.","Formulations suitable for oral administration can consist of (a) liquid solutions, such as a therapeutically effective amount of the inventive compound dissolved in diluents, such as water, saline, or orange juice, (b) capsules, sachets, tablets, lozenges, and troches, each containing a predetermined amount of the active ingredient, as solids or granules, (c) powders, (d) suspensions in an appropriate liquid, and (e) suitable emulsions.

The foodstuff or beverage can be any suitable foodstuff or beverage. In some embodiments, the foodstuff or beverage has a relatively high fat content.","It will be appreciated by one of ordinary skill in the art that, in addition to the aforedescribed pharmaceutical compositions, the compound or salt of the present invention may be formulated as inclusion complexes, such as cyclodextrin inclusion complexes, or liposomes. Liposomes serve to target the compounds to a particular tissue, such as lymphoid tissue or cancerous hepatic cells. Liposomes can also be used to increase the half-life of the inventive compound. Liposomes useful in the present invention include emulsions, foams, micelles, insoluble monolayers, liquid crystals, phospholipid dispersions, lamellar layers and the like. In these preparations, the active agent to be delivered is incorporated as part of a liposome, alone or in conjunction with a suitable chemotherapeutic agent. Thus, liposomes filled with a desired inventive compound or salt thereof, can be directed to the site of a specific tissue type, hepatic cells, for example, where the liposomes then deliver the selected compositions. Liposomes for use in the invention are formed from standard vesicle-forming lipids, which generally include neutral and negatively charged phospholipids and a sterol, such as cholesterol. The selection of lipids is generally guided by consideration of, for example, liposome size and stability of the liposomes in the blood stream. A variety of methods are available for preparing liposomes, as described in, for example, Szoka et al., 9, 467 (1980), and U.S. Pat. Nos. 4,235,871, 4,501,728, 4,837,028, and 5,019,369. For targeting to the cells of a particular tissue type, a ligand to be incorporated into the liposome can include, for example, antibodies or fragments thereof specific for cell surface determinants of the targeted tissue type. A liposome suspension containing a compound or salt of the present invention may be administered intravenously, locally, topically, etc. in a dose that varies according to the mode of administration, the agent being delivered, and the stage of disease being treated.","In certain embodiments, the pharmaceutical composition can be administered parenterally, e.g., intravenously, subcutaneously, intradermally, or intramuscularly. Thus, the invention provides compositions for parenteral administration that comprise a solution or suspension of the inventive compound or salt dissolved or suspended in an acceptable carrier suitable for parenteral administration, including aqueous and non-aqueous isotonic sterile injection solutions. Many such compositions are known in the art.","In accordance with an embodiment, the invention provides a method of inhibiting a farnesoid X receptor in a mammal in need thereof, which method comprises administering to the mammal an effective amount of a compound of the invention.","Preferably, the animal is a mammal. More preferably, the mammal is a human.","The term \u201cmammal\u201d includes, but is not limited to, the order Rodentia, such as mice, and the order Logomorpha, such as rabbits. It is preferred that the mammals are from the order Carnivora, including Felines (cats) and Canines (dogs). It is more preferred that the mammals are from the order Artiodactyla, including Bovines (cows) and Swines (pigs) or of the order Perssodactyla, including Equines (horses). It is most preferred that the mammals are of the order Primates, Ceboids, or Simioids (monkeys) or of the order Anthropoids (humans and apes). An especially preferred mammal is the human.","In certain embodiments, the FXR-mediated disease or condition is cardiovascular disease, atherosclerosis, arteriosclerosis, hypercholesteremia, or hyperlipidemiachronic liver disease, gastrointestinal disease, renal disease, cardiovascular disease, metabolic disease, cancer (i.e., colorectal cancer), or neurological indications such as stroke. In certain embodiments, the chronic liver disease is primary biliary cirrhosis (PBC), cerebrotendinous xanthomatosis (CTX), primary sclerosing cholangitis (PSC), drug induced cholestasis, intrahepatic cholestasis of pregnancy, parenteral nutrition associated cholestasis (PNAC), bacterial overgrowth or sepsis associated cholestasis, autoimmune hepatitis, chronic viral hepatitis, alcoholic liver disease, nonalcoholic fatty liver disease (NAFLD), nonalcoholic steatohepatitis (NASH), liver transplant associated graft versus host disease, living donor transplant liver regeneration, congenital hepatic fibrosis, choledocholithiasis, granulomatous liver disease, intra- or extrahepatic malignancy, Sjogren's syndrome, Sarcoidosis, Wilson's disease, Gaucher's disease, hemochromatosis, or alpha 1-antitrypsin deficiency. In certain embodiments, the gastrointestinal disease is inflammatory bowel disease (IBD) (including Crohn's disease and ulcerative colitis), irritable bowel syndrome (IBS), bacterial overgrowth, malabsorption, post-radiation colitis, or microscopic colitis. In certain embodiments, the renal disease is diabetic nephropathy, focal segmental glomerulosclerosis (FSGS), hypertensive nephrosclerosis, chronic glomerulonephritis, chronic transplant glomerulopathy, chronic interstitial nephritis, or polycystic kidney disease. In certain embodiments, the cardiovascular disease is atherosclerosis, arteriosclerosis, dyslipidemia, hypercholesterolemia, or hypertriglyceridemia.","In accordance with a preferred embodiment, the invention provides a method of treating or preventing obesity in a mammal in need thereof, comprising administering to the mammal an effective amount of a compound or salt of the invention.","As used herein, obesity can be considered as a condition in which excess body fat may put a person at health risk (see Barlow and Dietz, 102: E29, 1998; National Institutes of Health, 6 (suppl. 2):51S-209S, 1998). Excess body fat is a result of an imbalance of energy intake and energy expenditure. In one embodiment in humans, the Body Mass Index (BMI) is used to assess obesity. In one embodiment, a BMI of 25.0 kg\/mto 29.9 kg\/mis overweight (also called grade I obesity), while a BMI of 30 kg\/mis truly obese (also called grade II obesity).","In another embodiment in humans, waist circumference is used to assess obesity. In this embodiment, in men a waist circumference of 102 cm or more is considered obese, while in women a waist circumference of 89 cm or more is considered obese. Strong evidence shows that obesity affects both the morbidity and mortality of individuals. For example, an obese individual is at increased risk for heart disease, non-insulin dependent (type 2) diabetes, hypertension, stroke, cancer (e.g. endometrial, breast, prostate, and colon cancer), dyslipidemia, gall bladder disease, sleep apnea, reduced fertility, and osteoarthritis, amongst others (see Lyznicki et al., 63:2185, 2001).","The dose administered to a mammal, particularly, a human, in accordance with the present invention should be sufficient to effect the desired response. Such responses include reversal or prevention of the undesirable effects of the disease or disorder mediated by the farnesoid X receptor expressed in the intestine for which treatment is desired or to elicit the desired benefit. In certain embodiments, the disorder is non-alcoholic fatty liver disease, obesity and type 2 diabetes (insulin resistance). One skilled in the art will recognize that dosage will depend upon a variety of factors, including the age, condition, and body weight of the human, as well as the extent of the non-alcoholic fatty liver disease in the human. The size of the dose will also be determined by the route, timing and frequency of administration as well as the existence, nature, and extent of any adverse side-effects that might accompany the administration of a particular compound and the desired physiological effect. It will be appreciated by one of skill in the art that successful treatment of non-alcoholic fatty liver disease, obesity, type 2 diabetes (insulin resistance) or other disease or disorder may require prolonged treatment involving multiple administrations.","In this regard, treatment of NAFLD via inhibition of the intestinal farnesoid X receptor can be regarded as a reduction in the clinical manifestations of hepatic steatosis in a mammal. While in many cases NAFLD does not cause signs or symptoms, NAFLD may cause fatigue, pain, particularly in the upper right abdomen, and weight loss. In some instances, NAFLD may progress to nonalcoholic steatohepatitis, an inflammation in the liver. NAFLD may progress to nonalcoholic fatty liver disease-associated cirrhosis which is a scarring of the liver accompanied by markedly decreased liver function. Over time, scarring can become so severe that the liver no longer functions adequately.","NAFLD can be assessed, for example, by ultrasound, computed tomography, magnetic resonance studies, or by liver biopsy. In certain embodiments, the mammal is consuming a high fat diet. A high fat diet can be considered as one that provides more than 30% of energy as fat (see, for example, Churchill Livingstone's Dictionary of Sport and Exercise Science and Medicine, S. Jennett, Elsevier Limited, 2008). In other embodiments, the invention provides a method of preventing non-alcoholic fatty liver disease in a mammal. Preventing non-alcoholic fatty liver disease can be regarded as reducing an expected manifestation of hepatic steatosis in a mammal that is subjected to a dietary change from a low fat or intermediate fat diet to a high fat diet.","Currently, no standard treatment for NAFLD exists. Physicians typically treat the risk factors that contribute to the disease. For example, physicians assist afflicted patients with weight loss programs and choice of a healthy diet, control of diabetes, and lowering of cholesterol.","In this regard, treatment of obesity via inhibition of the farnesoid X receptor can be regarded as a reduction in the rate of weight gain in a mammal. In certain embodiments, the mammal is consuming a high fat diet. A high fat diet can be consider as one which provides more than 30% of energy as fat (see, for example, Churchill Livingstone's Dictionary of Sport and Exercise Science and Medicine, S. Jennett, Elsevier Limited, 2008). In other embodiments, the invention provides a method of preventing obesity in a mammal. Preventing obesity can be regarded as reducing an expected weight gain in a normal weight mammal that is subjected to a dietary change from a low fat or intermediate fat diet to a high fat diet.","In this regard, treatment of diabetes via inhibition of the farnesoid X receptor can be regarded as a reduction of insulin resistance in a patient afflicted therewith. Insulin resistance can result in hyperglycemia, and a reduction in insulin resistance can result in a lowering of blood glucose levels. Non-limiting examples of symptoms that be treated via inhibition of the farnesoid X receptor include brain fogginess and inability to focus, high blood sugar, intestinal bloating, sleepiness, weight gain, fat storage, difficulty losing weight, increased blood triglyceride levels, increased blood pressure, increased pro-inflammatory cytokines associated with cardiovascular disease, depression, acanthosis nigricans, and increased hunger.","The dose administered to a mammal, particularly, a human, in accordance with the present invention should be sufficient to effect the desired response. Such responses include reversal or prevention of the bad effects of the disease or disorder mediated by the farnesoid X receptor for which treatment is desired or to elicit the desired benefit. In certain embodiments, the disorder is obesity. One skilled in the art will recognize that dosage will depend upon a variety of factors, including the age, condition, and body weight of the human, as well as the extent of the obesity in the human. The size of the dose will also be determined by the route, timing and frequency of administration as well as the existence, nature, and extent of any adverse side-effects that might accompany the administration of a particular compound and the desired physiological effect.

Preventing obesity can be regarded as reducing an expected weight gain in a normal weight mammal that is subjected to a dietary change from a low fat or intermediate fat diet to a high fat diet.","Suitable doses and dosage regimens can be determined by conventional range-finding techniques known to those of ordinary skill in the art. Generally, treatment is initiated with smaller dosages that are less than the optimum dose of the compound. Thereafter, the dosage is increased by small increments until the optimum effect under the circumstances is reached. The present inventive method typically will involve the administration of about 0.1 to about 300 mg (e.g., about 0.1 to about 150 mg, about 0.1 to about 100 mg, or about 0.1 to about 50 mg) of one or more of the compounds described above per kg body weight of the mammal.","The therapeutically effective amount of the compound or compounds administered can vary depending upon the desired effects and the factors noted above. Typically, dosages will be between 0.01 mg\/kg and 250 mg\/kg of the subject's body weight, and more typically between about 0.05 mg\/kg and 100 mg\/kg, such as from about 0.2 to about 80 mg\/kg, from about 5 to about 40 mg\/kg or from about 10 to about 30 mg\/kg of the subject's body weight. Thus, unit dosage forms can be formulated based upon the suitable ranges recited above and the subject's body weight. The term \u201cunit dosage form\u201d as used herein refers to a physically discrete unit of therapeutic agent appropriate for the subject to be treated.","Alternatively, dosages are calculated based on body surface area and from about 1 mg\/mto about 200 mg\/m, such as from about 5 mg\/mto about 100 mg\/mwill be administered to the subject per day. In particular embodiments, administration of the therapeutically effective amount of the compound or compounds involves administering to the subject from about 5 mg\/mto about 50 mg\/m, such as from about 10 mg\/mto about 40 mg\/mper day. It is currently believed that a single dosage of the compound or compounds is suitable, however a therapeutically effective dosage can be supplied over an extended period of time or in multiple doses per day. Thus, unit dosage forms also can be calculated using a subject's body surface area based on the suitable ranges recited above and the desired dosing schedule.","As demonstrated herein, farnesoid X receptor is implicated in the development of obesity. Thus, administration of inhibitors of farnesoid X receptor is expected to treat or prevent the development of obesity, particularly in a mammal consuming a high fat diet.","Here, it has also been shown that intestinal farnesoid X receptor plays an essential role in the progression of NAFLD. Inhibition of intestinal farnesoid X receptor in embodiments of the invention has been shown to ameliorate NAFLD induced by a high fat diet.","Through studies on tempol and antibiotics that remodel and kill gut bacteria, respectively, a novel pathway was uncovered in which these agents alter the population of the gut microbiota resulting in loss of bacteria that express the enzyme bile salt hydrolase (BSH). Lower BSH results in increased levels of conjugated bile acids in the intestine, such as T-\u03b2-MCA. T-\u03b2-MCA in turn is an antagonist of intestinal FXR. Lower FXR signaling in the intestine results in decreased obesity, insulin resistance and NAFLD in mice fed a high-fat diet, and in genetically obese mice. These studies led to the hypothesis that inhibiting FXR would be a promising approach for treating patients with obesity, insulin resistance and NAFLD. Oral administration of a new chemical entity glycine \u03b2-muricholic acid (Gly-MCA) decreases obesity, insulin resistance and NAFLD in high-fat diet-treated mice and in genetically obese mice. It is proposed that any compound that is orally administered and retained in the intestine and that inhibits intestinal FXR and has no effect on FXR expressed in liver, would have utility in the treatment of patients with obesity, insulin resistance and NAFLD.","Chemistry","Compounds of formula 1, wherein W is OR, Ris hydrogen, Rand Rare hydrogen, X is C\u2550O, m is 1 and Y is NH, such as \u03b2-Muricholic acid 9 and conjugates thereof, such as the representative embodiments of tauro-\u03b2-Muricholic acid 10 and glycine-\u03b2-Muricholic acid 16 can be prepared as illustrated in the scheme set forth in . Esterification of the dihydroxy acid 1 with, for example, methanol under acid catalysis provides ester 2. Protection of the A-ring hydroxyl group with ethyl chloroformate provides carbonate 3. Oxidation of the 7-hydroxyl group with, for example potassium chromate gives ketone 4. Bromination with, for example, bromine in HBr gives bromo ketone 5. Reduction of the ketone with, for example, gives bromo alcohol 6. Reductive elimination of bromine using, for example, zinc metal provides olefin 7. Cis-dihydroxylation with, for example, osmium tetroxide gives cis diol 8. Hydrolysis of both esters provides \u03b2-muricholic acid 9. \u03b2-muricholic acid 9 can be conjugated with taurine using a suitable coupling agent provides tauro-\u03b2-muricholic acid 10. Glycine can be substituted for taurine to provide the glycine conjugate of \u03b2-muricholic acid (16). 2-aminoethylphosphonic acid can be substituted for taurine to provide the phosphonic acid analog of tauro-\u03b2-muricholic acid. The chemistry is as described in Iida, T., et al., 16: 863-5 (1981), Iida T., et al., 30: 1267-1279 (1989), and Tserng K-Y., et al., 18: 404-407 (1977).","Compounds of formula I, wherein X is CH, wherein m is 2, can be prepared for example by the route illustrated in , starting with the illustrative embodiment of \u03b2-muricholic acid 9. The carboxylic acid is protected via acid-catalyzed esterification to provide compound 11. The hydroxyl groups in compound 11 can be protected using any suitable protecting group such as benzyl (Bzl) to give compound 12. Reduction of the carboxyl group using any suitable reducing agent, for example, lithium aluminum hydride provides alcohol 13. Conversion of the hydroxyl group to a suitable leaving group, for example, bromo, using any suitable reagents such as triphenylphosphine and carbon tetrabromide gives compound 14. Displacement of the leaving group in 13 using, for example, a nucleophilic reagent of the formula: HYCHCHSOH wherein Y is NH, O, S, or Se followed by deprotection gives taurine conjugated analog

After purification with a QIAquick PCR Purification kit (Qiagen, Valencia, Calif.), the quality and quantity were assessed using a DNA 7500LabChip on the Agilent 2100 Bioanalyzer (Agilent Technologies, Santa Clara, Calif.) and Qubit quantification. The sequencing was performed using a quarter PTP plate on a 454 Life Sciences Genome Sequencer FLX+ (Roche Diagnostics, Indianapolis, Ind.). 16S rRNA gene sequencing analysis was performed as previously described (Lozupone and Knight, 71:8228-8235, 2005). Weighted UniFrac analysis to assess changes in the bacterial abundance was performed on the Galaxy web-based platform (Blankenberg et al., 26:1783-1785, 2010; Goecks et al., 11: 126, 2010; Giardine et al., 15:1451-1455, 2005).","Metagenomic Data Analysis","After quality filtering and deduplication, each sample contained on average 11 thousand reads. The Mothur software package was used to preprocess the sequencing data and the RDP multi-classifier to assign each sequence to a taxonomic rank. Preprocessing consisted of filtering reads for an average quality of 20, removing duplicated sequences and splitting into samples by barcodes while allowing for one mismatch in the barcode. To account for differences in total reads per sample, classifications were converted to percent of total reads. This approach then permitted accurate comparisons within and between groups.","Metabolomics Analysis","Lipidomics analysis: For serum lipidomics analysis 25 \u03bcl serum were extracted by 4-fold cold chloroform:methanol (2:1) solution containing 2 \u03bcM LPC (17:0), PC (17:0), SM (17:0) and CER (17:0) (Avanti Polar Lipids, Alabaster, Ala.) as internal standards. The samples were vortexed for 30 s and then allowed to stand for 5 min at room temperature. The mixture was centrifuged at 13,000 rpm for 5 min and then the lower organic phase was collected and evaporated at room temperature under vacuum. The residue was dissolved in chloroform:methanol (1:1), followed by diluting with isopropanol:acetonitrile:HO (2:1:1) containing 2 \u03bcM PC (17:0) prior to UPLC-MS analysis. For tissue lipidomics analysis, about 50 mg of accurately weighted tissues were homogenized with 700 \u03bcL methanol: HO (4:3) solution and then extracted using 800 \u03bcL chloroform containing 2 \u03bcM LPC (17:0), SM (17:0) and CER (17:0) as internal standards. The homogenate was incubated at 37\u00b0 C. for 20 min followed by centrifuged for 20 min at 13,000 rpm. The lower organic phase was transferred to a new tube and dried under vacuum. The residue was suspended with 100 \u03bcL chloroform:methanol (1:1) solution and then diluted with isopropanol:acetonitrile:HO (2:1:1) solution containing 2 \u03bcM PC (17:0) before injection. For lipidomics discovery, samples were analyzed by UPLC-ESI-QTOF MS using a Water Acquity CSH 1.7 um C18 column (2.1\u00d7100 mm) under the following conditions: UPLC: A-acetonitrile\/water (60\/40), B-isopropanol\/acetonitrile (90\/10). Both A and B contained 10 mM Ammonium acetate and 0.1% formic acid. Gradient: initial 60% A to 57% A at 2 min, to 50% A at 2.1 min*, to 46% A at 12 min, to 30% A at 12.1 min*, to 1% A at 18 min before returning to initial conditions at 18.5 min with equilibration for 2 additional minutes (an *indicates ballistic gradient). Flow rate was 0.4 ml\/min. Column temperature was maintained at 55\u00b0 C. MS, same conditions as above, except run time was 18 min.","Global metabolomics analysis: urine samples were prepared by adding 20 \u03bcL of urine to 180 \u03bcL 50% aqueous acetonitrile (50:50 water\/acetonitrile). Samples were vortexed for 5 min and centrifuged at 18000\u00d7g for 20 min at 4\u00b0 C. to remove particulates and precipitated protein. The supernatant was transferred to an autosampler vial for analysis. 50 mg tissue samples were homogenized in 500 mL 50% aqueous acetonitrile containing 5 \u03bcM of chlorpropamide (internal standard). The samples were vortexed and centrifuged at 13,000 rpm for 20 min at 4\u00b0 C. to remove particulates and precipitate protein. The supernatant was transferred to an autosampler vial for analysis. For metabolomics discovery, a 5 \u03bcl aliquot of supernatant samples was injected into the UPLC-ESI-QTOFMS system (Waters, Milford, Mass.) with a Waters Acquity BEH 1.7 \u03bcm C18 (2.1\u00d750 mm) column. The gradient mobile phase comprises 0.1% formic acid in water (A) and 0.1% formic acid in acetonitrile (B). The gradient was maintained at initial 95% A for 0.5 min, to 40% A at 4 min, and then to 1% A at 8 min. The column was flushed for 1 min, then equilibrated at initial conditions for 1.5 min. Flow rate was 0.5 ml\/min. Column temperature was maintained at 60\u00b0 C. Waters Synapt HDMS Q-TOF was operated in both positive and negative modes, scanning 50-850 amu, at a rate of 0.3 scans\/sec. The following instrument conditions were used: capillary 3 kV, source temperature 120\u00b0 C., sampling cove 30V, desolvation gas flow 850 L\/h at 400\u00b0 C. Biomarker identification and quantitation: Biomarkers were screened by analyzing ions in the loading scatter plot, and metabolomics databases (METLIN and Madison Metabolomics Consortium Database) were searched to find potential candidates. To confirm the identities of the putative markers, the authentic standards were compared with the metabolites based on MS\/MS fragmentation pattern and retention time. Concentrations of the metabolites were determined by multiple reaction-monitoring mass spectrometry based on standard curves using authentic standards.","Data Processing and Multivariate Data Analysis","Chromatographic and spectral data were deconvoluted by MarkerLynx software (Waters). A multivariate data matrix containing information on sample identity, ion identity (retention time and m\/z), and ion abundance was generated through centroiding, deisotoping, filtering, peak recognition, and integration. The intensity of each ion was calculated by normalizing the single ion counts vs. the total ion counts in the whole chromatogram. The data matrix was further exported into SIMCA-P software (Umetrics, Kinnelon, N.J.) and transformed by mean-centering and pareto scaling, a technique that increases the importance of low abundance ions without significant amplification of noise. Statistical models including principal components analysis (PCA), partial least squares-discriminant analysis (PLS-DA), and orthogonal projections to latent structures-discriminant analysis (OPLS-DA) were established to represent the major latent variables in the data matrix.","NMR-Based Metabolomics Experiments","Methanol, KHPO, NaHPO(all in analytical grade), sodium 3-trimethylsilyl[2,2,3,3-d4]propionate (TSP-d4) and DO (99.9% in D) were purchased from Sigma-Aldrich (St. Louis, Mo.). Phosphate buffer (0.1 M KHPO\/NaHPOand PH 7.4) was prepared with KHPO and NaHPOfor their good solubility and low-temperature stability. Liver samples (\u02dc50 mg) were extracted three times with 0.6 mL 600 \u03bcL of precooled methanol-water mixture (2\/1, v\/v) using the PreCellys Tissue Homogenizer (Bertin Technologies, Rockville, Md.). After centrifugation at 11180\u00d7g for 10 min at 4\u00b0 C., the combined supernatants were dried. Each of the aqueous extracts was separately reconstituted into 600 \u03bcL phosphate buffer containing 50% DO and 0.005% TSP-d4 (chemical shift reference). Following centrifugation, 550 \u03bcL of each extract was transferred into a 5 mm NMR tube. Cecal content samples were directly extracted using an optimized procedure described previously (Wu et al., 2010). Briefly, samples (\u02dc50 mg) were mixed with 600 \u03bcL precooled phosphate buffer, vortexed for 30 s and subjected to three consecutive freeze-thaws followed by homogenization using the Precellys\u2122 Tissue Homogenizer.

H NMR spectra were corrected manually for phase and baseline distortions and spectral region \u03b4 0.5-9.5 was integrated into regions with equal width of 0.004 ppm (2.4 Hz) using AMIX software package (V3.8, Bruker-Biospin, Germany). Region \u03b4 4.45-5.20 was discarded by imperfect water saturation. Regions \u03b4 1.15-1.23 and \u03b4 3.62-3.69 were also removed for ethanol contaminations in the cecal contents during mice dissection process. Each bucketed region was then normalized to the total sum of the spectral integrals to compensate for the overall concentration differences prior to statistical data analysis.","Multivariate data analysis was carried out with SIMCAP+ software (version 13.0, Umetrics, Sweden). Principal Component Analysis (PCA) was initially carried out on the NMR data to generate an overview and to assess data quality. Orthogonal projection to latent structures with discriminant analysis (OPLS-DA) was subsequently conducted on the NMR data. The OPLS-DA models were validated using a 7-fold cross validation method and the quality of the model was described by the parameters R2X and Q2 values. To facilitate interpretation of the results, back-transformation (Cloarec et al., 77:517-526, 2005) of the loadings generated from the OPLS-DA was performed prior to generating the loadings plots, which were color-coded with the Pearson linear correlation coefficients of variables (or metabolites) using an in-house developed script for MATLAB (The Mathworks Inc.; Natwick, Mass.). In this study, a cutoff value of |r|>0.811 (r>0.755 and r<\u22120.755) was chosen for correlation coefficient as significant based on the discrimination significance (p\u22660.05).","Bile Salt Hydrolase Activity","Fecal proteins were prepared from feces samples (0.5 g) in pH 7.4 phosphate buffered saline (PBS, 5.0 mL) using sonication. Bile salt hydrolase (BSH) activity was measured based on the generation of CDCA from TCDCA in the feces. Briefly, incubation was carried out in 3 mM sodium acetate buffer, pH 5.2, containing 0.1 mg\/ml fecal protein and 50 \u03bcM TCDCA-d5 in a final volume of 200 \u03bcL. After a 20 min incubation at 37\u00b0 C., the reaction was stopped by plunging the samples into dry ice. 100 \u03bcL of acetonitrile was directly added to the reaction mix. After centrifuging at 14,000\u00d7g for 20 min, 5 \u03bcL of the supernatant was transferred to an auto sampler vial subjected to analysis by a UPLC system coupled with a XEVO triple quadrupole tandem mass spectrometer (Waters Corp., Milford, Mass.).","Mitochondrial Isolation and Functional Studies","For intestinal mitochondria, the mucosa of ileum was gently scraped, washed 2\u00d7 with PBS, minced in ice-cold mitochondrial homogenization buffer (225 mM mannitol, 75 mM sucrose, 5 mM MOPS, 0.5 mM EGTA and 2 mM taurine (pH 7.25)) containing 0.2% BSA, and homogenized in a loose fitting homogenizer. Homogenates were centrifuged at 500\u00d7g for 10 min at 4\u00b0 C. The supernatant was then centrifuged at 10,000\u00d7g for 10 min at 4\u00b0 C. The final mitochondrial pellet was resuspended in mitochondrial isolation buffer containing 0.2% BSA at a concentration of 0.5 mg\/ml before functional assessment.","The oxygen consumption of isolated mitochondria was measured in a chamber connected to a Clark-type Oelectrode (Instech) and Omonitor (Model 5300, YSI Inc) at 25\u00b0 C. Mitochondria were incubated in respiration buffer (120 mM KCl, 5 mM MOPS, 0.1 mM EGTA, 5 mM KHPOand 0.2% BSA) with substrates for either complex I (5 mM glutamate and 5 mM malate), or complex II (5 mM succinate and 1 \u03bcM rotenone). State 3 (maximal) respiration activity was measured after addition of 1 mM ADP. ADP independent respiration activity (State 4) was monitored after addition of 2 \u03bcM oligomycin. The respiratory control ratio was determined by the state 3\/state 4 respiration rates.","Histological Analysis","Hematoxylin and eosin (H&E) staining were performed on formalin fixed paraffin embedded sections using a standard protocol. Oil red O staining was performed on frozen liver sections using a standard protocol. At least three discontinuous liver sections were evaluated for each mouse.","Triglycerides Content Quantification","Hepatic lipids were extracted using a 2:1 chloroform-methanol solution.

Inc. Gly-MCA was custom synthesized.","Bacon-flavored dough pills were produced as described (Walker et al., 260:65-69, 2012) for oral administration of Gly-MCA (0.25 mg Gly-MCA\/pill). Mice were trained to eat the dough pills prior to the study.","Male wild-type (WT) C57BL\/6N mice, 6- to 8-weeks-old, were fed a HFD (Bio-Serv, Frenchtown, N.J.; 60 kcal % fat) from the age of 6 weeks and were orally administered with vehicle (control pills) or Gly-MCA (0.25 mg\/pill\/day, 10 mg\/kg). Mice were housed individually in their home cages. Cumulative food intake and TEEwere measured for 1 week in vehicle and Gly-MCA-treated mice from 6 to 7 weeks of HFD.

ATP levels in the ileum mucosa of both groups of mice were determined as described herein. The results are depicted in .","As is apparent from the results depicted in , ATP levels in the ileum mucosa of Fxrmice, which do not express farnesoid X receptor (FXR) in the intestine, were markedly elevated as compared with ATP levels in the ileum mucosa of control Fxrmice that express intestinal FXR. These results indicate increased energy expenditure occurred in the small intestine in the absence of the nuclear receptor FXR.","This example demonstrates that glycine-\u03b2-muricholic acid (Gly-MCA) is an FXR antagonist.","Mice make T\u03b2MCA in the liver while humans preferentially make Gly-MCA. Thus, it was of interest to determine whether Gly-MCA was also an FXR antagonist. Chenodeoxycholic acid (CDCA), an FXR agonist at a dose of 100 \u03bcM, increased expression of the Fxr target gene Shp mRNA four-fold and the induction of Shp mRNA with CDCA was inhibited by Gly-MCA in a dose dependent manner (). Gw4064, a synthetic FXR agonist, induced expression of the FXR target genes Shp and Fgf19 at both 2 \u03bcM and 5 \u03bcM concentrations, and induction of both genes was blocked by Gly-MCA \u25a1 in a dose dependent manner (). In addition, Gw4064 treatment inhibited Atp5g mRNA expression and Gly-MCA reversed this inhibition (). These data indicate that Gly-MCA, produced in humans, is an FXR antagonist similar to T\u03b2MCA.","This example demonstrates the effect of tempol on body mass of high-fat diet-treated Fxrand Fxrmice.","Vehicle and tempol-treated Fxrand Fxrmice were maintained on a high-fat diet for 10 weeks.  depicts the body mass gain in grams for vehicle and tempol-treated Fxrand Fxrmice after 10 weeks of a high-fat diet feeding.","As is apparent from the results depicted in , tempol treatment of Fxrmice resulted in a weight gain that was approximately 65% less of the weight gain exhibited by vehicle treated mice. Tempol treatment of Fxrmice, which are intestinal-specific Fxr-null mice, resulted in an insignificant difference in weight gain, thereby implicating intestinal FXR in mediating the lower weight gain by tempol of mice fed a high-fat diet.","This example demonstrates the role of intestinal FXR in lipid and glucose metabolism.","Male Fxrand Fxrmice were fed a high fat diet revealing that Fxrmice were resistant to high fat diet-induced obesity. The fat mass in grams and as a percentage of body mass was measured in non-anesthetized mice using an Echo 3-in-1 NMR analyzer (Echo Medical Systems, Houston, Tex.), and the results depicted in . The results show that fat mass and the ratio of fat and body mass of Fxrmice were higher than for Fxrmice. The glucose tolerance test (GTT) revealed that Fxrmice had improved glucose intolerance compared to Fxrmice, which is depicted in , which shows the area under the curve for blood glucose (in mg\/dL) as a function of time. The insulin tolerance test (ITT), which is depicted in , demonstrated that the insulin sensitivity in Fxrmice was significantly increased as compared to Fxrmice. In addition, fasted serum insulin levels and the HOMA in Fxrmice was significantly increased as compared to Fxrmice, while fasted glucose was approximately the same in both groups of mice, as depicted in .","This example demonstrates that tempol affects bile acid homeostasis via inhibition of the genus ","Significant phylum-level shifts from Firmicutes to Bacteroidetes in the gut microbiome composition were observed in mouse cecum following 5 days of tempol treatment by gavage (250 mg\/kg) of mice on normal chow diet. Heat map diagrams of 16S rRNA sequencing indicated that tempol treatment dramatically decreased the family Lactobacillacieae. It was found that tempol treatment robustly reduced the genus . Similar to the results of acute treatment via gavage, qPCR analysis of suspected fecal microbes obtained from mice on a high fat diet revealed total bacteria remain unchanged between vehicle and tempol treated mice, while tempol treatment cause a shift from Firmicutes to Bacteroidetes, as depicted in . These results indicate that the effects of tempol on the gut microbiome are independent of diet and obesity conditions. Furthermore, the genus of the Lactobacillaceae was decreased, coincident with significant downregulation of bile salt hydrolase (BSH) enzymatic activity in the feces, as depicted in . Bile salt hydrolase (BSH) deconjugates taurine-conjugated bile acids produced in the liver to free bile acids.","These results indicate that tempol affects bile acid homeostasis via inhibition of the genus ","This example demonstrates the results of a human FXR competition assay using the synthetic agonist Gw4064 and varied doses of TUDCA, T\u03c9MCA, T\u03b2MCA, T\u03b1MCA.

Luciferase detection was conducted using the Dual Luciferase Reporter Assay kit (Promega Corp., Madison, Wis.) and a Tecan GeniosPro luminescent plate reader (Research Triangle Park, N.C.). The results are illustrated in .","As is apparent from the results illustrated in , all of the bile acid conjugates TUDCA, T\u03c9MCA, T\u03b2MCA, and T\u03b1MCA inhibited FXR in the presence of the synthetic agonist Gw4064.","This example demonstrates that changes in the gut microbiota brought about by tempol are correlated with NAFLD.","High-fat diet (HFD) is extensively used as a mouse model for NAFLD. The antioxidant tempol selectively modulates the gut microbiota composition and metabolism under normal diet conditions (Li et al., 4: 2384, 2013). In an effort to determine whether tempol modifies the gut microbiome in the HFD-induced NAFLD model, 16S rRNA gene sequencing analysis was carried out. Weighted UniFrac\u2122 analysis showed distinct clustering of cecal communities isolated from vehicle and tempol-treated groups on a HFD for 12 weeks. Principal coordinate 1 (PC1) explains 56.08% of the variation, indicating that tempol had a stronger effect on microbiota composition than vehicle in mice on a HFD for 12 weeks (). The separation of samples in the principal components analysis plot reflects abundance differences in significantly decreased Firmicutes and markedly increased Proteobacteria. The genus was identified as a major contributor of the increased Proteobacteria (), which was found to be significantly lower in obese subjects (Karlsson et al., 20:2257-2261, 2012). A dramatic increase in the genus was observed (), which is negatively correlated with body weight in dogs (Handi et al., 84332-343, 2013). The genus and levels were also significantly decreased in tempol-treated mice, whereas the levels of genus and remained similar ().","To identify gut microbiota related markers in urine, ultra-performance liquid chromatography coupled with electrospray ionization quadrupole time-of-flight mass spectrometry (UPLC-ESI-QTOFMS)-based metabolomics analysis was employed. PCA modeling of UPLC-ESI-QTOFMS negative mode data from mouse urine demonstrated clear discrimination between the tempol and the control group (). Loadings scatter plot analysis revealed that two compounds, p-cresol sulfate (m\/s 187.0060 with retention time 2.61 min) and p-cresol glucuronide (m\/s 283.0812 with retention time 3.04 min) were significantly reduced in urine of the tempol-treated group ( and C). The identities of these compounds were confirmed by MS\/MS analysis (). These results indicated that tempol remodeled the gut microbiota composition and altered gut microbiota-related metabolism markers in mice on HFD for 14 weeks. Similar to the results of the tempol treatment model to specifically modulate the gut flora, metabolomics analysis revealed that the urinary levels of p-cresol sulfate and p-cresol glucuronide were almost absent in antibiotic-treated mice on a HFD for 14 weeks (). Following the change of the gut microbiota composition and related metabolites, liver histology indicated a significant reduction in hepatic lipid droplets in tempol-treated mice on a HFD for 16 weeks and antibiotic-treated mice on a HFD for 7 weeks ( and B, and ). Tempol treatment and antibiotic treatment, which also changes the gut microbiota composition, decreased liver weights and liver\/body mass ratios, respectively ( and D,  and B). Hepatic triglyceride (TG) contents were decreased to approximately 50% and 35% in mice treated with antibiotic and tempol, respectively ( and ).","This example demonstrates that gut microbiota modifies bile acid metabolism and affects FXR signaling.","The gut microbiota is tightly associated with bile acid metabolism. UPLC-ESI-QTOFMS-based metabolomics analysis was adopted to determine bile acid composition and levels of bile acid metabolites in the intestine. Scores scatter plot of a PCA model of the UPLC-ESI-QTOFMS negative mode data from mouse ileum indicated distinct metabolic profiles between the vehicle and antibiotic groups (). The top enriched metabolite, T\u03b2MCA (m\/z 514.2871, retention time=6.64 min), was increased in the antibiotic-treated mice on a HFD for 7 weeks as revealed in the loading scatter plot () according to previous methods; this increase was similar to what was observed with tempol treatment (Li et al., 12:1369-1376, 2013). Analysis of ileum bile acid composition revealed that the levels of taurine-conjugated bile acid T\u03b2MCA were significantly increased after antibiotic treatment (). Similar results were obtained from tempol-treated mice on a HFD for 16 weeks (). The gut microbiota can modify bile acid composition by microbial enzymatic activities. The activity of bile salt hydrolase (BSH), a bacterial enzyme that hydrolyzes taurine-conjugated bile acids to free bile acids, was greatly reduced in the antibiotic-treated mice on a HFD for 7 weeks (). This likely accounts for the most significantly enriched bile acid in the ileum of antibiotic- and tempol-treated mice on a HFD that was T\u03b2MCA, an FXR antagonist (Li et al., 12:1369-1376, 2013; Sayin et al., 225-235, 2013). Western blot and qPCR analysis indicated that 12 weeks of HFD treatment significantly induced FXR protein levels () and FXR signaling in the ileum as revealed by increases in mRNAs from the FXR target genes, small heterodimer partner (Shp) and fibroblast growth factor 15 (Fgf15) mRNAs (). Conversely, antibiotic treatment decreased Shp and Fgf15 mRNAs indicating that FXR signaling was inhibited in the ileum (). The question arose as to whether T\u03b2MCA inhibited FXR signaling in mice on HFD treatment in vivo. T\u03b2MCA treatment significantly blunted the Shp and Fgf15 induction by the FXR agonist TCA in the ileum of mice treated with antibiotic on a HFD for three days (). These results indicated that both antibiotic and tempol treatments regulated bile acid composition, mainly by increasing T\u03b2MCA as a result of lower bacterial BSH activity, which inhibited FXR signaling in the ileum of HFD-fed mice.","This example demonstrates that intestine-specific Fxr disruption reduces hepatic lipid accumulation in high-fat diet fed mice.","To further clarify the role of intestinal FXR in the development of NAFLD, intestine-specific Fxr-null (Fxr) mice were treated with HFD for 14 weeks. H&E staining and Oil red O staining of liver sections showed a significant decrease in lipid accumulation in livers of Fxrmice compared to wild-type (Fxr) mice ( and B). Fxrmice displayed significantly reduced liver weight and ratio of liver weight (). This change in liver weight was largely due to hepatic triglyceride (TG) levels that were 50% lower in Fxrmice compared to Fxrmice on a HFD for 14 weeks (). Mechanistic studies revealed that the expression of mitochondrial electron transport chain (ETC) complex II related genes such as succinate dehydrogenase complex, subunit D, integral membrane protein (Sdhd), complex III related gene such as cytochrome c1 (Cyc1), complex IV related gene such as mitochondrially-encoded cytochrome c oxidase II (mt-Co2), cytochrome c oxidase subunit IV isoform 1 (Cox4i1), cytochrome c oxidase subunit Va (Cox5\u03b1), ATP synthase, H+ transporting, mitochondrial F0 complex, subunit C1 (subunit 9) (Atp5g) and ATP synthase, H+ transporting, mitochondrial F0 complex, subunit D (Atp5h), were elevated in the ileum epithelium of Fxrmice (). Similar results were obtained from antibiotic-treated mice (). Subsequently, there was an approximately 70% increased activity of complex II and no significant elevation in activity of complex I in the ileum mitochondria of Fxrmice compared to Fxrmice (). Ileum ATP levels in Fxrmice were also significantly higher than in Fxrmice (). Free fatty acids are closely associated with the development of hepatic steatosis (Donnelly et al., 115:1343-1351, 20052005). However, serum lipidomics revealed that a subset of species of free fatty acids were at similar levels in vehicle- and tempol-treated Fxrmice and Fxrmice (). LC-MS\/MS quantitation confirmed that ileum C16:0, C18:0, C20:0, C22:0, C24:0 and C24:1 ceramide levels were significantly reduced in antibiotic-treated mice on a HFD for 7 weeks (). Accordingly, serum C16:0, C18:0, C20:0, C24:0 and C24:1 ceramide levels in antibiotic-treated mice were also significantly lower than in vehicle-treated mice (). The identity of each ceramide was confirmed by LC-MS fragmnentography (). Further, intestinal mRNAs encoding de novo ceramide synthesis-related genes, such as serine palmitoyltransferase, long chain base subunit 3 (Sptlc3), ceramide synthase 4 (Cers4), degenerative spermatocyte homolog 1 (Degs1), and sphingomyelin phosphodiesterase 3 (Smpd3) waned significantly in Fxrmice and antibiotic-treated mice ( and D). Ceramide synthase 2 (Cers2) mRNA levels were significantly decreased in antibiotic-treated mice, and have a reduced trend (P=0.06) in Fxrmice. The expression of genes involved in ceramide catabolism such as sphingomyelin synthase 1 and 2 (Sgms1 and Sgms2), and alkaline ceramidase 1 and 3 (Acer1 and Acer3) remained similar in Fxrmice and antibiotic-treated mice ( and D)","This example demonstrates that ceramide regulates the SREBP1c-CIDEA pathway in the liver.","To establish a causal relationship between the decrease in ceramide levels and improvement of NAFLD, mice on a HFD were treated with antibiotics for a short duration. Three days of antibiotic treatment did not decrease triglyceride content in the liver (). Subsequently, the FXR signaling pathway was inhibited as revealed by decreased expression of the FXR target gene Shp and Fgf15 mRNAs (). As early as 3 days after antibiotic treatment, ceramide levels in the ileum of antibiotic-treated mice were significantly decreased (). These results indicated ceramide might be the cause rather than the result of the development of NAFLD and a biomarker to monitor NAFLD. The contribution of ceramide to NAFLD was further evaluated in cultured primary mouse hepatocytes. Ceramide treatment induced a significantly increased triglyceride contents in primary hepatocytes in a dose-dependent manner (). To elucidate the mechanisms by which ceramide leads to hepatic steatosis, the expression of the genes involved in hepatic lipogenesis and fatty acid oxidation were measured. Fatty acid synthesis-related genes such as sterol response element-binding protein 1c (Srebp1c), DNA fragmentation factor-alpha-like effector a (Cidea), elongation of very-long-chain fatty acids protein 6 (Elovl6) and TG formulation related genes such as diacylglycerol O-acyltransferase 2 (Dgat2) were significantly upregulated by ceramide in primary hepatocytes (). In contrast, the expression of genes involved in fatty acid \u03b2-oxidation such as carnitine palmitoyltransferase 1 (Cpt1), acyl-coenzyme A oxidase 1 (Acox1), enoyl-coenzyme A, hydratase\/3-hydroxyacyl coenzyme A dehydrogenase (Ehhadh), and acetyl-coenzyme A acyltransferase 1A (Acaa1a) were not affected by ceramide treatment (). In agreement with the mRNA results, ceramide exposure at 2 \u03bcM and 10 \u03bcM significantly induced the protein levels of the mature nuclear form of SREBP1-N and the SREBP1-N target gene protein CIDEA ( and G). In vivo, mRNAs encoded by the hepatic fatty acid synthesis related genes Srebp1c, Cidea, fatty acid synthase (Fasn), and Elov16 were decreased in antibiotic-treated mice compared to vehicle-treated mice, and Fxrcompared to Fxrmice ( and B). The expression of genes involved in fatty acid remained at similar levels in antibiotic-treated mice compared to vehicle-treated mice, and Fxrcompared to Fxrmice ( and D). Western blot analysis further revealed that the protein levels of the mature nuclear form of SREBP1-N and CIDEA were significantly downregulated in livers of antibiotic-treated mice on a HFD for 7 weeks ( and F). The rate limiting enzyme cholesterol 7\u03b1-hydroxylase (CYP7A1) initiates the classic pathway for bile acid synthesis and plays an important role in regulating lipid metabolism. Cyp7a1 mRNA levels were marginally induced in antibiotic-treated mice, but not in tempol-treated mice ( and H). In addition, inflammation-related genes such as toll-like receptor 2 (Tlr2), toll-like receptor 4 (Tlr4), toll-like receptor 9 (Tlr9) and tumor necrosis factor \u03b1 (Tnf\u03b1), were comparable in antibiotic- and tempol-mice ( and J). The present findings revealed that inhibition of ceramide metabolism might be a major contributing factor to improve HFD-induced NAFLD development in antibiotic-treated mice.","This example demonstrates that inhibition of intestinal FXR is required for gut microbiome-mediated progression of NAFLD.","Fxrmice were employed to determine the role of intestinal FXR in the progression of the NAFLD. Liver histology revealed that antibiotic and tempol treatment decreased hepatic lipid droplets in Fxrmice on a HFD for 14 and 16 weeks, respectively; no changes in hepatic lipid were observed in Fxrmice with these treatments ( and B and  and B). The liver weights and liver\/body mass ratios of antibiotic- and tempol-treated Fxrmice were significantly reduced, whereas the liver weights and liver\/body mass ratios were similar in Fxrand Fxrmice ( and D,  and D). Hepatic triglyceride content analysis confirmed that antibiotic and tempol treatment did not alleviate hepatic steatosis in Fxrmice ( and ). Ileum and serum C16:0, C18:0, C20:0, C22:0, C24:0 and C24:1 ceramide levels were significantly decreased in Fxrmice and tempol-treated Fxrmice, but not in Fxrmice ( and G). In Fxrmice, hepatic fatty acid synthesis related genes such as Srebp1c, Cidea, Fasn, and Elovl6 remained unchanged between vehicle-treated and antibiotic-treated mice (). Further, the protein levels of the mature nuclear form of SREBP1 and CIDEA proteins were significantly reduced in the liver of tempol-treated mice, whereas no decrease was noted in Fxrmice treated with tempol ( and H). The present findings revealed that inhibition of intestinal FXR mediates the amelioration of NAFLD caused by antibiotic and tempol treatments.","This example demonstrates the systemic responses of mice on a high-fat diet, to tempol and antibiotic treatment.","A total of 53 metabolites involved in the metabolism of amino acids, carbohydrates and nucleotides were identified by H NMR. 1D H NMR spectra of the cecal contents are dominated by short chain fatty acids (SCFAs), nucleotides, oligosaccharides and some amino acids. Glycogen, glucose, amino acids and nucleotides are the dominant metabolites observed in the H NMR spectra of liver.","In order to obtain the metabolic variations associated with different biological sample groups, pair-wise OPLS-DA was performed between data obtained from cecal contents or liver of mice after tempol or antibiotic treatment. The quality of these models was further validated by evaluation with CV-ANOVA (p<0.05) and permutation test (200 tests) for the OPLS-DA and PLS-DA models. Compared with the vehicle-treated wild-type mice, tempol treatment significantly decreased the levels of SCFAs (acetate, propionate, and butyrate) but significantly elevated the levels of oligosaccharides and glucose in the cecal contents. Similar changes in SCFAs and oligosaccharides were also observed from the cecal contents of the antibiotic-treated wild type mice compared to those from the respective controls. However, no significant differences in the levels of SCFAs and oligosaccharides were observed in the cecal contents between tempol-treated and vehicle-treated Fxrmice.","Tempol treatment significantly decreased the levels of lipid and unsaturated fatty acid (UFA) in the livers, whereas tempol treatment significantly elevated the levels of glucose, glycogen, bile acids and a range of nucleotide metabolites (e.g., uridine, hypoxanthine and 5\u2032-IMP), nicotinurate, and choline in comparison with the vehicle-treated wild-type mice. These observations are consistent with reduced lipogenesis in the liver due to tempol treatment. However, no significant change in lipid and glucose metabolism was observed in the liver of Fxrmice after tempol-treatment. In addition, antibiotic treatment significantly elevated the levels of bile acids, trimethylamine oxide (TMAO, choline, fumarate, formate, amino acids including branched chain amino acids (leucine, isoleucine and valine), alanine, glycine, tyrosine and phenylalanine, and some nucleic acids such as hypoxanthine, uridine and 5\u2032-IMP in the liver. Compared with the vehicle-treated Fxrmice, Fxrmice exhibit lower lipid and UFA levels but higher taurine and glycogen levels in the livers.","This example demonstrates a synthesis of \u03b2-muricholic acid 9, glycine-\u03b2-muricholic acid (Gly-MCA) , and tauro-\u03b2-muricholic acid (T-\u03b2-MCA)  in accordance with an embodiment of the invention.","\u03b2-Muricholic acid (\u03b2-MCA) 9 was prepared as illustrated in  by following the literature procedure (Iida T, Momose T, et al., 30: 1267-1279 (1989)). In general, esterification of the dihydroxy acid 1 with methanol under acid catalysis provided ester 2 in quantitative yield. Protection of the hydroxyl group in the 3 position with ethyl chloroformate provided carbonate 3. Oxidation of the 6-hydroxyl group with potassium chromate gave ketone 4 in quantitative yield. Bromination with 47% HBr solution gave bromo ketone 5, which on reduction with NaBHgave bromohydrin  in moderate yield. Reductive dehydrobromination with zinc metal provided olefin 7 in about 80% yield. Cis-dihydroxylation with osmium tetroxide to give cis diol 8 followed by hydrolysis provided s-muricholic acid 9 in quantitative yield. r-muricholic acid 9 was conjugated with glycine to provide glycine-\u03b2-muricholic acid (Gly-MCA) 16. A suspension of ethyl glycinate was reacted with \u03b2-MCA 9 and EEDQ by refluxing overnight. The residue obtained after workup was dissolved in boiling ethanol and hydrolyzed with 10%\/o KCO. The aqueous solution was acidified to give Gly-MCA 16 as a white powder in 68% yield. H NMR (CDCl) 0.75 (s, 3H, 18-Me), 1.01 (d, 3H, J=6.5 Hz, 21-Me), 1.14 (s, 3H, 19-Me), 3.44-3.56 (m, 2H), 3.58-3.61 (m, 1H), 3.91 (s, 2H).","T\u03b2MCA 11 was similarly prepared from 9 by conjugation with taurine instead of glycine.","This example demonstrates that Gly-MCA is stable in the intestine.","Fecal extracts were prepared as described above. Gly-MCA (50 \u03bcM) was incubated with fecal extract (0.1 mg\/mL). The negative control was fecal extract alone. The positive control was fecal extract (0.1 mg\/mL) and T\u03b2MCA acid (50 \u03bcM). The samples were analyzed by UPLC to determine the amount of \u03b2\u03b2-MCA (hydrolysis product) and the results shown in .","Gly-MCA was given to mice via oral gavage at dosages of 0, 1, 5, and 50 mg\/kg of Gly-MCA, with the Gly-MCA dosed in corn oil. Gly-MCA was detected using ultra performance liquid chromatography-electrospray ionization-quadrupole time-of-flight mass spectrometry (UPLC-ESI-QTOFMS). The results are shown in .","As is apparent from the results shown in , Gly-MCA is stable in the intestine.","This example demonstrates that mice treated with Gly-MCA do not develop significant liver toxicity.","Mice were dosed with vehicle or Gly-MCA at 1 mg\/kg, 5 mg\/kg, and 50 mg\/kg. After 24 h, serum aminotransferase (ALT) and aspirate aminotransferase (AST) levels were determined and the results shown in .","As is apparent from the results shown in , Gly-MCA did not exhibit significant liver toxicity at each of the doses as compared with vehicle.","This example demonstrates that Gly-MCA significantly inhibited the FXR activity induced by the synthetic FXR agonist GW4064.","HEK293T fibroblasts were transiently co-transfected with (1) a chimeric receptor construct in which the carboxy terminal portions of human FXR (containing the native ligand-binding domain and AF2 transactivation domain) was fused to an amino terminal GAL4 DNA-binding domain under regulatory control of the constitutively active SV40 promoter, (2) a firefly luciferase reporter plasmid driven by the UAS GAL4 DNA response element, and (3) a Renilla luciferase reporter gene (pRL-luciferase; Promega; Madison, Wis.) as a transfection efficiency control. GW4064 or GW4064 and Gly-MCA were added to the media for 24 h, the cells were harvested, and cell extracts prepared. Luciferase detection was conducted using the Dual Luciferase Reporter Assay kit (Promega; Madison, Wis.) and a Tecan GeniosPro\u2122 luminescent plate reader (Research Triangle Park, N.C.). The results are shown in .","As is apparent from the results shown in , Gly-MCA significantly inhibited the FXR activity induced by GW4064.","This example demonstrates that Gly-MCA is a potent antagonist of FXR.","Differentiated Caco-2 cells were treated with 100 \u03bcM of the FXR agonist chenodeoxycholic acid (CDCA) and with 0, 100 \u03bcM, or 200 \u03bcM Gly-MCA, and expression of the FXR target gene Shp mRNA measured. As is apparent from the results shown in , CDCA caused a 4-fold increase in expression of Shp mRNA. Gly-MCA inhibited the induction of Shp mRNA with CDCA in a dose-dependent manner.","Differentiated Caco-2 cells were treated with 0.2 \u03bcM or 5 \u03bcM GW4064 and with 100 \u03bcM or 200 \u03bcM Gly-MCA. Control cells were not treated with either agent. Relative expression of the FXR target gene mRNAs, Shp mRNA, Fgf19 mRNA, and Atp5g mRNA were determined and the results shown in , respectively. Expression of Shp mRNA and Fgf19 mRNA induced by GW4064 was blocked by Gly-MCA in a dose-dependent manner ( and B). GW4064 treatment inhibited expression of the FXR target gene Atp5g mRNA and Gly-MCA reversed the inhibition ().","This example demonstrates that inhibition of FXR signaling by Gly-MCA is a potent therapeutic strategy for treatment of obesity, insulin resistance and NAFLD.","To determine whether inhibition of intestinal FXR could be a therapeutic target for high-fat diet (HFD)-induced obesity, insulin resistance and NAFLD, and confirm that this transcription factor is a suitable drug target, HFD-treated mice were orally administered Gly-MCA. Gly-MCA treatment reduced body weight gain after one week of treatment with a HFD ( and B). The absolute fat mass and the fat\/lean mass ratio, measured by NMR, were significantly decreased in Gly-MCA-treated mice after 7 weeks of treatment compared with vehicle-treated mice ( and D). To explore the mechanism of reduced adiposity in Gly-MCA-treated mice, cumulative food intake, energy expenditure (EE) using an energy balance technique (TEE: food energy intake and body composition change) were measured. Food intake was comparable between the two groups (). Gly-MCA treatment increased the energy expenditure significantly, which could contribute to the decreased body weight gain of mice on a HFD compared with vehicle-treated mice (). To clarify the role of Gly-MCA in obesity-related glucose homeostasis, glucose and insulin tolerance tests (GTT and ITT, respectively) were performed. The GTT revealed that after 6 weeks of HFD challenge, Gly-MCA-treated mice displayed significantly reduced blood glucose levels after glucose loading compared with vehicle-treated mice ( and B). The ITT demonstrated that the insulin sensitivity was significantly increased after Gly-MCA treatment (). These results indicated that Gly-MCA improved HFD-induced obesity and insulin resistance. Liver histology indicated a marked reduction in hepatic lipid droplets after Gly-MCA treatment of mice that were fed a HFD for 7 weeks (). Gly-MCA treatment decreased liver weights and liver\/body mass ratios (). Hepatic triglyceride contents were decreased to approximately 51% in mice treated with Gly-MCA (). These results indicated that Gly-MCA treatment protected mice from HFD-induced non-alcoholic fatty liver disease (NAFLD). To exclude the possibility that the effect of Gly-MCA on body weight and NAFLD were due to a non-specific toxicological effects, serum aminotransferase (ALT) and aspartate aminotransferase (AST) biomarkers of liver toxicity were determined. ALT and AST were significantly higher on a HFD and GlyMCA treatment significantly decreased serum ALT and AST levels ( and B), thus indicating that the dose of Gly-MCA employed was not toxic, but actually decreased HFD-induced hepatic toxicity. NAFLD is tightly associated with bile acid metabolism. UPLC-ESI-QTOFMS-based metabolomics analysis was adopted to determine bile acid composition and levels of bile acid metabolites in the feces and intestine. A Scores scatter plot of a PCA model of the UPLC-ESI-QTOFMS negative mode data from mouse feces and ileum indicated distinct metabolic profiles between the vehicle- and Gly-MCA-treated groups ( and B). The top enriched metabolite, T\u03b2MCA (m\/z 514.2871, retention time=6.64 min), was increased in the Gly-MCA-treated mice on a HFD for 9 weeks as revealed in the loading scatters plot (). Levels of T-J-MCA were significantly increased whereas TCA levels were significantly decreased in feces after Gly-MCA treatment (). The levels of taurine-conjugated bile acids were increased in the ileum of Gly-MCA-treated mice, notably, levels of T\u03b2MCA were significantly increased (). Gly-MCA levels were markedly increased in the feces and ileum after Gly-MCA treatment for 9 weeks (, respectively). Serum triglyceride levels remained similar between the two groups on a HFD for 9 weeks ( and B). Serum C16:0, C20:0, C22:0, and C24:1 ceramides levels, and ileum C16:0, C18:1, and C24:0 ceramides levels were reduced in Gly-MCA treated mice on a HFD for 9 weeks ( and B). Gly-MCA treatment decreased Shp and Fgf15 mRNAs indicating that FXR signaling was inhibited in the ileum (). Intestinal mRNAs encoding ceramide de novo synthesis-related genes, such as serine Sptlc3, Cers4, Degs1, and Smpd3 were significantly lower in Gly-MCA-treated mice (). The expression of Shp mRNA was similar between two groups indicating that FXR signaling wasn't affected in the liver (). Cyp7a1 mRNA levels were induced in Gly-MCA-treated mice (). Since Fgf15 mRNA levels were lower, this might contribute to the increase of Cyp7a1 mRNA levels in Gly-MCA-treated mice. In a model of genetically-induced obesity, leptin receptor-deficient (db\/db) mice treated with Gly-MCA for 6 weeks had reduced body weight as compared to vehicle-treated mice; weight loss was significant after just one week of treatment (). The absolute fat mass and the fat\/lean mass ratio, as measured by NMR, were significantly decreased in Gly-MCA-treated db\/db mice after 6 weeks of Gly-MCA treatment compared with vehicle-treated mice ( and B). Liver histology indicated a significant decrease in hepatic lipid droplets after Gly-MCA treatment (). Gly-MCA treatment decreased liver weights and liver\/body mass ratios ( and C). Liver TG contents were dramatically improved in mice treated with Gly-MCA (). Gly-MCA treatment significantly decreased serum ALT and AST levels (), thus indicating that the dose of Gly-MCA employed was not toxic to the db\/db mice and reduced liver toxicity in this mouse model. Levels of T-\u03b1-MCA and T\u03b2MCA were significantly increased in feces and ileum after Gly-MCA treatment (). The accumulation of Gly-MCA in the ileum is far much more than liver, feces, and serum (). Serum triglyceride levels remained similar after 6 weeks of Gly-MCA treatment (). Serum C16:0, C20:0, C22:0, and C24:1 ceramides levels, and ileum C16:0, C18:0, C18:1, C20:0, C22:0, C24:0 and C24:1 ceramides levels were reduced in Gly-MCA treated mice compare to vehicle treatment ( and C). In another model of HFD-induced obesity, C57BL\/6N mice made obese by 12 weeks of feeding a high-fat diet, were treated with Gly-MCA. Due to limited amounts of Gly-MCA, these mice were treated with only 5 mg\/kg GMCA. Despite the lower dosing, they had reduced body weight gain as compared to vehicle-treated mice from two weeks of treatment (). The absolute fat mass, as measured by NMR, were significantly decreased in Gly-MCA-treated obese mice after 6 weeks of treatment compared with vehicle-treated mice (). Liver histology indicated a marked amelioration in hepatic lipid droplets after Gly-MCA treatment (). Gly-MCA treatment reduced liver weights and liver\/body mass ratios ( and C). Levels of T\u03b1MCA and T\u03b2MCA were significantly enhanced in feces and ileum after Gly-MCA treatment (). The accumulation of Gly-MCA in the ileum is far greated than liver, feces, and serum ().","All references, including publications, patent applications, and patents, cited herein are hereby incorporated by reference to the same extent as if each reference were individually and specifically indicated to be incorporated by reference and were set forth in its entirety herein.","The use of the terms \u201ca\u201d and \u201can\u201d and \u201cthe\u201d and \u201cat least one\u201d and similar referents in the context of describing the invention (especially in the context of the following claims) are to be construed to cover both the singular and the plural, unless otherwise indicated herein or clearly contradicted by context.
