title: Methods and systems for detecting an electronic intrusion
abstract: Methods and systems for detecting an electronic intrusion are described. The system receives a notification, over a network, from a first application server that is hosting a first electronic service that is hosting a first user account. The notification reports the detection of a user activity associated with the first user account. The first user account is monitored for user activity. Next, the system may identify the notification reporting the detection of the user activity associated with the first user account as a possible electronic intrusion into the first account.

For example, the request may include a service provider identifier  that identifies the service provider (e.g., Bank of America) and the user account where the user activity was detected and a request for instructions from the user. The request may include whether to block access to the account or permit access to the account. In another embodiment the request for instructions may further include an instruction to shut down the account. In one embodiment the request may be displayed on a user interface of a mobile device , as illustrated and described in .","At operation , at the mobile device , the client application program  may receive and display the request for instructions to the user. At operation , the client application program  may receive a selection from the user and communicate the selection in a response to the alarm server . For example, the selection may identify that the alarm server  should return instructions to application server , ,  associated with the service provider to block access to the account.","At operation , at the alarm server , the communication module  may receive the response. At operation , the communication module may identify a timeout in the absence of receiving the response. At decision operation , the processing module  may process the response or the timeout. If the processing module  identifies a response that includes instructions in the form of a selection to permit access to the account, then the processing continues at operation . If the processing module  identifies a response that includes instructions in the form of a selection to block access to the account, then processing continues at operation . If the processing module  identifies a timeout then processing continues based on the timeout response  for the electronic domain , as configured by the user. For example, the processing may continue at operation  to permit access to the account or the processing may continue at operation  to block access to the account. Other embodiments may include additional selections as being available to the user (e.g., shut down the account, permit read-only access to the account). At operation , the processing module  may identify the user activity on the first account as an electronic intrusion into the first account. At operation , the communication module  may return the response (permit access, block access, etc.,) to the application server  in response to the notification of user activity received in operation .","At operation , the application server  may receive the command information, and at operation  the application server  may block access to the account.
