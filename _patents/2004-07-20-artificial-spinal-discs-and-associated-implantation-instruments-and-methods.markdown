{"@attributes":{"id":"description"},"RELAPP":[{},{}],"heading":["CROSS-REFERENCE","BACKGROUND","SUMMARY","DETAILED DESCRIPTION"],"p":["This application claims priority from U.S. Provisional Patent Application Ser. No. 60\/501,929 filed on Sep. 10, 2003, and entitled \u201cARTIFICIAL SPINAL DISCS AND ASSOCIATED IMPLEMENTATION INSTRUMENTS AND METHODS.\u201d","The present invention relates to artificial spinal discs, and instruments and methods associated with the implantation of such artificial spinal discs.","Current spinal therapies for treating problematic spinal discs are moving from rigid fixation of adjacent vertebrae across the problematic disc space, such as with rods or plates, to maintaining the relative motion of the adjacent vertebrae, such as with artificial spinal discs. For instance, an artificial spinal disc may be utilized to treat degenerative disc disease, including a herniated nucleus pulposus and\/or posterior osteophytes, which causes radiculopathy and\/or myelopathy. Radiculopathy is compression of a spinal nerve root, while myelopathy is compression of the spinal cord. Both are conditions that may result in an individual experiencing pain or tingling in the arms, legs, back and\/or neck.","Current artificial spinal discs have drawbacks relating to their fixation to the adjacent vertebrae and their ability to be revised, or removed, after their implantation. For instance, current artificial discs may have special contours that need to be machined into the endplates of the adjacent vertebrae. Further, current artificial discs may require special machining of the vertebrae and\/or implantation instrumentation to accommodate spikes, fins, or other structures extending into the adjacent vertebrae that are used to fixate the disc to the vertebrae. Additionally, current artificial discs may include bone in-growth surfaces across the entire vertebrae-contacting surface. This makes it difficult to remove the artificial disc, as is sometimes required, once the artificial disc is implanted.","Similarly, the associated implantation instruments and methods have a number of drawbacks relating to their complexity or to their suitability for use in more sensitive areas of the spine, such as in the cervical spine. For instance, some implantation systems require the use of many different instruments and devices to prepare the disc space and properly insert the artificial disc. Further, some implantation systems rely on impacting, or hammering, features into the bone to accommodate the artificial disc. Such impaction techniques may be suitable in certain areas of the spine, like in the lumbar spine, but are not as desirable in other areas of the spine, like the cervical spine, where the proximity of the spinal cord and nerve roots would favor more delicate procedures.","In one embodiment, an intervertebral disc space preparation guide comprises a spacer portion having a first recess and a first machining guide comprising a first bore. The first bore and the first recess are aligned and adapted to receive a first bone removal mechanism.","In another embodiment, an intervertebral disc space preparation guide comprises a spacer portion for insertion into the intervertebral space and a cutting guide for placement outside the intervertebral space. The first cutting guide including first and second sides. The intervertebral disc space preparation guide further comprises a first guiding bore extending through the first side of the cutting guide. The first guiding bore is adapted to receive a first bone removal mechanism.","In another embodiment, a method of preparing an intervertebral disc space between a pair of vertebral endplates to receive an implant comprises selecting a guide assembly. The guide assembly comprises a spacer portion and a guide portion. The method further comprises inserting the spacer portion into the intervertebral disc space. The spacer portion comprises a first recess positioned adjacent to a first one of the vertebral endplates. The method further comprises passing a bone removal instrument through a first bore in the guide portion and into the first recess in the spacer portion and creating a first channel in the first vertebral endplate adjacent to the first recess.","The present invention relates to artificial disc systems, and methods and devices associated with implanting these disc systems into a spine. One example of an artificial disc system is the system described in U.S. Pat. No. 6,113,637, which is hereby incorporated by reference. The artificial disc systems provide predetermined bone in-growth areas that allow for revising or removing the artificial disc after implantation and bony in-growth. Further, the artificial disc systems include structural features that improve instrument accessibility in performing such a revision. Additionally, the artificial disc systems include structures for stabilizing the disc within the associated vertebrae. And, the associated instruments and devices simplify the implantation of the artificial disc systems, as well as providing less traumatic insertion of the systems into the disc space.","Referring to , one embodiment of an artificial spinal disc system  includes a first member  movable relative to a second member  via an articulation component . Each of first and second members ,  include at least one bone-contacting surface ,  for placement against a portion of an adjacent vertebral bone. Each bone-contacting surface ,  may include at least one bone in-growth surface ,  of a predetermined size and shape, and in a predetermined position and orientation on the respective surface , . The predetermined size, shape, positioning and orientation of bone in-growth surface ,  allows for a calculated amount of bone growth into the disc members ,  for secure fixation to the adjacent bone, while allowing for easy removal of the disc member from the adjacent bone after bone in-growth occurs if such removal is required at a later date by changing medical needs. Further, the top surface ,  of bone in-growth surface ,  may have a predetermined spacing ,  () above the remaining portion of bone-contacting surface ,  to allow for increased penetration and\/or compression of the adjacent vertebral bone into bone in-growth surface ,  upon implantation of artificial disc system . Additionally, each member ,  may include at least one bone in-growth area indicator ,  that identifies the location of the bone in-growth surface , . For instance, after artificial disc system  is implanted, bone in-growth area indicator ,  provides a visual marker that can be seen by the naked eye, such as through an incision that exposes a surface of the system , or by medical diagnostic equipment, such as x-ray, ultrasound, magnetic resonance, computed tomography, positron emission technology, and other such diagnostic techniques. Further, bone in-growth area indicator ,  may further include an instrument access guide ,  that cooperates with a medical instrument, such as an osteotome, used in removing artificial disc system . Instrument access guide ,  directs the instrument to the exact position of bone in-growth surface , , thereby avoiding unnecessary work in non-bone-in-growth areas of bone-contacting surface ,  and without interfering with other structures that may be present on surfaces , . Thus, artificial disc system  provides features for secure fixation to adjacent vertebral bone while allowing for easy removal of all or a portion of the system if later required by changing medical needs.","Bone in-growth surface ,  generally has a size that is substantially less than the overall size of the respective bone-contacting surface , . Further, bone in-growth surface ,  may be positioned on respective bone-contacting surface ,  such that after implantation bone in-growth surface ,  is located proximal to cancellous bone portions, rather than cortical bone portions, of the adjacent vertebral bone. Such positioning, for example, may be at the center of member ,  for a disc system that substantially spans the disc space or vertebral endplate. Alternatively, such positioning may be off-center with respect to member ,  if the disc system only spans a portion of the disc space or vertebral end plate. Additionally, bone in-growth surface ,  may be positioned at a predetermined spacing ,  from an edge ,  of member ,  that is exposed after implantation of the system , such as an edge that is not within the disc space between the adjacent vertebrae. Predetermined spacing ,  allows for easier entry of an instrument, such as an osteotome, that is used to separate member ,  from the vertebral bone after bony in-growth has occurred. Furthermore, bone in-growth surface ,  may lie in a single plane, or may lie in one or more planes, which may be intersecting planes, if more secure fixation and bony in-growth is desired. Suitable examples of bone in-growth surface ,  may include surfaces that are chemically-etched, machined, sprayed, layered, fused, coated or textured in any manner or with any material that allows for the growth and attachment of bone.","Bone in-growth indicator ,  may include any type of marker, such as an indentation, an embedded marker, coatings, projections, etc., on any surface of member , . Further, instrument access guide ,  may include any surface or combination of surfaces that work in cooperation with a surface or portion of a medical instrument used from separating member ,  from bone. Alternatively, instrument access guide ,  may comprise a marker to indicate a position in computer- and\/or image-guided surgery.","Further, referring to , securing of the artificial disc system  to bone may be enhanced by applying a bone growth promoting substance  to a bone contacting surface ,  of the artificial disc system. In particular, bone growth promoting substance  may be applied to one or more bone in-growth surfaces  to encourage bone to growth into this area. Suitable examples of bone growth promoting substances include bone morphogenic protein (\u201cBMP\u201d), LIM mineralization protein (\u201cLMP\u201d), demineralized bone matrix (\u201cDBM\u201d), mesenchymal stem cells, blood platelet gel, and other similar materials.","Articulation component  may be a structure integral with, or separable from, one or both of first member  and the second member . Referring to , for example, in one embodiment articulation component  includes a joint  defined by at least a partly convex or curvilinear surface , such as a substantially spherical ball, projecting from first member  movable in at least a partly concave or curvilinear surface , such as an elongated socket, formed within second member . Alternatively, articulation component  may be an entirely separate member or combination of members, such as a ball, disc, nucleus, flexible and\/or elastic component, etc., positionable in combination with first and second members ,  to allow relative rotational and\/or translational motion between the first and second members. Furthermore, first and second member ,  and articulation member  may be interconnected to form a single assembly.","Additionally, artificial disc system  may include at least one fin or rail member  projecting out of bone contacting surface ,  on at least one of first or second member , . Fin or rail member  provides surfaces ,  positioned substantially normal to bone contacting surface ,  that oppose translational or rotational movement of member ,  within adjacent vertebral bone in a plane parallel to the surfaces , . It should be noted, however, that the particular orientation of surfaces ,  may be adjusted to resist relative motion in any desired plane or direction. Additionally, fin or rail member  may include a top engagement surface , such as may be formed by teeth, knurling, texturing, etc., that further resists movement of member ,  within bone. For example, for an artificial spinal disc system  inserted into the disc space from the anterior side, top engagement surface  may resist movement of the implanted disc in the anterior direction by allowing bone to grow or be positioned in the medial lateral direction between portions of the top engagement surface. Surface  may be oriented to resist relative motion between member ,  and bone in a different direction, but in the same plane, as surfaces , . It should be noted, however, that surfaces ,  and  may be oriented in a manner to resist any combination of directions of relative motion. Additionally, top engagement surface , as well as surface ,  may be formed with angled or other biased surfaces that have a greater resistance to motion in one or more desired directions. For example, top engagement surface  may include a plurality of teeth defined by at least two surfaces, where at least one surface is substantially normal to bone contacting surface ,  and the other wall is substantially non-orthogonally-angled relative to bone contacting surface , .","Further fin or rail member  may lie along a line oriented parallel to an insertion direction, where the insertion direction is a direction in which artificial spinal disc system , or either individual member , , is inserted into position between adjacent vertebrae. It should be understood, however, that fin or rail member  may lie along a curvilinear line, and may be angled with respect to the insertion direction. Additionally, fin or rail member  may be of any predetermined length. For example, fin or rail member  may be of a length greater than or less than the overall edge-to-edge length of artificial spinal disc system . For instance, fin or rail member  may be of a length such that it is spaced apart from any edge of the disc system , or one or both ends of the fin or rail member may be substantially parallel with an edge of the disc system. When an end of fin or rail member  is parallel with an edge of disc system , such as exposed edge , , then the fin or rail member may act as bone in-growth indicator ,  and\/or instrument access guide , .","Additionally, artificial spinal disc system  may include tabs  or other longitudinally extending members that allow the disc system to be held with an insertion instrument. For instance, tabs  may include one or more connector structures  (), such as an internal wall that defines a cavity or hole, that correspond with engaging features on an insertion instrument that is utilized to hold and\/or insert one or both members , . Alternatively, connector structure  may include projections that extend into corresponding holes or cavities in the insertion instrument. Further, tabs or extending members  may prevent movement of member ,  relative to the overlapping bone after implantation. For example, for a disc system  that is inserted between adjacent vertebrae from the anterior side, tabs or extending members  project away from the disc space and over the anterior portion of the vertebral body, thereby preventing relative movement of the member ,  in the posterior direction.","First member , second member  and articulation component  each may be formed from any combination of one or more different biocompatible materials. Suitable materials include stainless steel, cobalt chrome, titanium, rubber, elastomer, polymers, etc., including all alloys and variations of these materials.","Referring to , in another embodiment, artificial spinal disc system  may include a first member  movable relative to a second member , where such movement has a predetermined range of motion , in at least one direction, greater than the natural range of motion  of the natural disc being replaced. For instance, in an embodiment where articulation component  comprises a convex surface  interacting with a concave surface , the concave surface  may have a predetermined range of motion  corresponding to an anterior-to-posterior translation greater than that of the natural range of anterior-to-posterior translation of the natural disc being replaced. For example, for a spinal disc anterior-to-posterior translation typically corresponds to flexion and extension movements of the spinal motion segment, which movements would typically be constrained by natural tissue, including muscle, tendons, annulus fibrosus and\/or facet joints. Thus, it may not be necessary to provide physical constraints within disc system  that limit the movement of first member  and second member , and hence articulation component , as the natural structure of the tissue adjacent the implanted artificial spinal disc system  may naturally limit the relative motion of the disc system. It should be noted that the predetermined range of motion  may be in any combination of one or more directions or planes, and may complete overlap the natural range of motion , be biased toward one side of the natural range of motion, or be within one side but extend beyond the other side of the natural range of motion. Additionally, although not required, artificial spinal disc system  may include a safety stop  positioned outside of the natural range of motion  to ultimately limit the movement of first member  relative to second member . Safety stop  may be formed in first member , second member  or in articulation component .","Referring to , embodiments of a method of implanting an artificial spinal disc system includes performing pre-operative planning (Block ), removing the existing natural disc (Block ), preparing the intervertebral space for receiving the artificial disc system (Block ), and inserting and securing the artificial disc system (Block ). The action of pre-operative planning may include examining the patient, taking x-rays or performing other diagnostic procedures to analyze the natural disc at issue, analyzing and\/or calculating the existing or natural range of motion of the spinal motion segment, and\/or measuring the natural disc space at issue to determine an appropriate size artificial disc system. The action of removing the natural disc may include a procedure such as a discectomy or partial discectomy, or any other procedure that removes all or a portion of the natural disc nucleus pulposus. The action of preparing the intervertebral space for receiving the artificial disc system may include contouring the end plates of the adjacent vertebrae. Such contouring may include forming parallel surfaces, forming concave surfaces, or forming any other shape in the end plate to receive the artificial disc system. In particular, as will be discussed in more detail below, the action of contouring the end plates may further include machining at least one fin or rail opening to receive a corresponding at least one fin or rail member associated with the artificial disc system. The action of machining may include removing a channel of bone from the end plate using tool having a surface adapted for removing bone, where the tool is capable of rotating, vibrating, reciprocating or otherwise acting on the end plate to remove bone. Further, the action of inserting and securing the artificial disc system may include holding a single component or the entire assembled artificial disc system and moving it into the prepared intervertebral disc space until it reaches a predetermined desired position. Securing the artificial disc system may occur naturally due to the compressive forces acting across the implanted artificial disc system, or may occur due to the contouring of the end plates, or may occur due to supplemental fixation techniques such as applying a screw or other component to hold a component of the system to the vertebral bone, or may occur as some combination of these techniques. Further, securing of the artificial disc system may be further achieved by applying a bone growth promoting substance to a bone contacting surface of the artificial disc system. Suitable examples of bone growth promoting substances include bone morphogenic protein (\u201cBMP\u201d), LIM mineralization protein (\u201cLMP\u201d), demineralized bone matrix (\u201cDBM\u201d), mesenchymal stem cells, blood platelet gel, and other similar materials. It should be noted that the above method may be achieved through an open surgical site, or in a minimally invasive manner such as through a tube or channel that allows from a relatively small opening in the skin and tissue of the patient compared to the open procedure.","Referring to , an embodiment of a method of implanting an artificial spinal disc system in the cervical portion of the spine includes positioning the patient for surgery, performing a discectomy and decompressing the disc space, preparing the adjacent vertebral endplates, and inserting the artificial spinal disc. Referring to , the patient  may be positioned such that their neck  is in a neutral position corresponding to the natural lordosis of the cervical spine. After making an incision, an access channel  to the natural spinal disc  and\/or adjacent vertebrae ,  may be maintained by an opener mechanism , such as one or more retractor blades or an endoscopic port or channel, respective examples including a TRIMLINE retractor blade or an X-TUBE endoscopic port both manufactured by Medtronic Sofamor Danek USA (Memphis, Tenn.). Then, referring to , the natural spinal disc  is removed using a disc removal instrument , such as a curette, osteotome or any instrument specifically designed for removal of all or a portion of the natural disc. After removal of all or a portion of the natural spinal disc , the disc space is decompressed, such as by using the Smith-Robinson decompression technique.","Referring to , after removal of the natural disc, referred to as a discectomy, and decompression, at least one contouring device  may be utilized to form a predetermined contour ,  which may generally correspond to the bone contacting surface of the artificial disc, into one of both of the adjacent vertebral bodies , . For example, in one embodiment, the vertebral end plates are machined to be flat and parallel, such as by using a cylindrical burr. It should be noted, however, that other contouring devices , such as mills, cutters, saws, etc., and other predetermined shape-forming devices may be used to remove bone from the end plates. In order to avoid subsidence of the artificial disc system into the end plates, the machining process may be performed to preserve as much cortical bone as possible. Additionally, referring specifically to , it should be noted that a reference device , such as a frame or such as markers, may be used in conjunction with contouring device  to control or guide the movements of the contouring device. For instance, reference device  may be attached to one or both adjacent vertebrae ,  so as to provide geometric guidance to contouring device . After end plate contouring is complete, then the prepared disc space  () may be ready for disc insertion and all external distraction may be removed.","Referring to , in order to determine the proper size artificial disc to use, an implant trial  may be inserted determine the size of the prepared disc space . In some embodiments that desire to avoid excessive compressive forces on the artificial disc system, the properly sized implant trial  fits snug in the prepared disc space  but does not distract the adjacent vertebrae , . Additionally, the fit of implant trial  may be confirmed diagnostically, such as with fluoroscopy. Referring to , once the appropriate sized implant trial  is determined, the correspondingly sized rail cutter guide  is selected and used to prepare one or more fin or rail channels in the endplates in correspondence with the fin or rail member on the artificial disc system.","Referring to , one embodiment of a rail cutter guide  includes at least one machining guide  positioned on guide body  and having a size  to provide a reference to a bone cutting device  to form a fin or rail member channel  in one or both adjacent vertebrae ,  corresponding in position and size to the fin or rail guide member on the artificial spinal disc system. In embodiments having more than one machining guide , referring specifically to , each machining guide  may have a predetermined longitudinal spacing  and\/or a predetermined lateral spacing  with respect one or more of the other machining guides. Such predetermined spacing ,  is advantageous for insuring formation of at least two fin or rail member channels  (), either in one vertebral end plate or in adjacent end plates, that are in alignment with the predetermined spacing of at least two or more fin or rail members on an artificial spinal disc selected to be implanted. Further, rail cutter guide  may include a spacer portion  sized and having a thickness  () corresponding to a desired disc spacing, such as the natural neutral disc spacing of the prepared disc space . Additionally, guide body  or spacer portion  may include predetermined recesses  sized to accommodate at least a portion of a bone removal device. Rail cutter guide  may further include a permanent or removably attachable handle  for manipulating the position of the guide. Referring specifically to , rail cutter guide  may further include an engagement structure , such as a protrusion or an extension, that interacts with urging mechanism , such as a hammer-like or moving-weight type device, for moving the guide  into proper position. Rather than, or in addition to, being referenced to the prepared disc space  and\/or the adjacent vertebrae ,  via spacer portion , rail cutter guide  may include one or more reference markers  so as to insure a desired positioning with respect to the adjacent vertebrae. The desired positioning, for example, may include a cephalad-caudal positioning, a lateral positioning, a depth within the prepared disc space  positioning, and any combination thereof. For example, reference marker  may include a limiting structure  projecting from guide body  so as to limit the depth of penetration of the guide body into prepared disc space . Further, one or more reference markers  may be associated with any other structure having a known position relative to one or both vertebrae ,  and\/or prepared disc space .","Referring back to , to position the rail cutter guide  relative to the adjacent vertebral bodies , , urging mechanism  may be utilized to move the rail cutter guide  into a desired position. For instance, in one embodiment, rail cutter guide  is impacted until all limiting structures  touch the anterior surface of the adjacent vertebrae , . Referring to , after removing urging mechanism , a bone removal mechanism  may be movable relative to machining guide  to create fin or rail member channel  (). In one embodiment, for example, bone removal mechanism  may include a drill bit  attachable to either an actuation mechanism , such as a power source or a manual drill bit handle. In this embodiment, drill bit  is inserted into one port formed within machining guide  on rail cutter guide , and operates to form one channel  in the endplate. Referring specifically to , it may be desired to secure the relative position of rail cutter guide  and the first-formed channel  (not shown) in order to insure proper geometric alignment of successive channels. In such a situation, a temporary fixation mechanism , such as a pin or screw, may be secured to rail cutter guide , such as to machining guide . Then, the successive channels  may be formed, and additional temporary fixation mechanisms  may be applied. Referring specifically to , after removing any temporary fixation mechanisms I and rail cutter guide , one or both endplates should have one or more properly positioned channels .","Referring to , an artificial spinal disc system  or , such as the PRESTIGE Cervical Disc manufactured by Medtronic Sofamor Danek USA (Memphis, Tenn.) may be attached onto an implant inserter . In one embodiment, for example, the implant inserter  includes four inserter prongs  (only 3 are visible in ), attached to legs  positioned within outer sheath , that fit into holes  within tabs . Outer sheath  is advanced to apply a force across the prongs  to hold the disc system  or . The one or more fin or rail members  are aligned with one or more channels  on the endplates of the adjacent vertebrae , , and the disc system  or  is inserted into the prepared disc space . Insertion may be aided by urging mechanism , and disc system  or  is advanced until the anteriorly positioned tabs  come into contact with the anterior surface of the adjacent vertebral bodies , . Disc system  or  may then be released by implant inserter , for example by sliding back outer sheath  and gently removing implant inserter . Final placement of disc system  or  between adjacent vertebrae ,  may be verified using medical diagnostic equipment, such as by using fluoroscopy. The surgery may be completed using standard closure procedures.","Thus, the present invention includes various embodiments of artificial spinal discs having predetermined bone in-growth areas and additional features to aid in the removal or revision of the implanted artificial disc. Additionally, the present invention includes various embodiments of fin or guide rail channel-forming mechanisms, and of methods of implanting artificial discs having at least one fin or guide rail member.","While the various embodiments of the present invention have been illustrated and described, it will be clear that the present invention is not limited to these embodiments only. For instance, all or predetermined portions of the bone-contacting surfaces of the artificial disc systems may comprise bone in-growth surfaces. Numerous modifications, changes, variations, substitutions and equivalents will be apparent to those skilled in the art without departing from the spirit and scope of the present invention as described in the claims."],"BRFSUM":[{},{}],"brief-description-of-drawings":[{},{}],"description-of-drawings":{"heading":"BRIEF DESCRIPTION OF THE DRAWINGS","p":["The various embodiments of the present invention will hereinafter be described in conjunction with the appended drawings provided to illustrate and not to limit the present invention, wherein like designations denote like elements, and in which:",{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0011","num":"0010"},"figref":"FIG. 1"},{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0012","num":"0011"},"figref":["FIG. 2","FIG. 1"]},{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0013","num":"0012"},"figref":["FIG. 3","FIG. 1"]},{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0014","num":"0013"},"figref":["FIG. 4","FIG. 1"]},{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0015","num":"0014"},"figref":["FIG. 5","FIG. 1"]},{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0016","num":"0015"},"figref":["FIG. 6","FIG. 1"]},{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0017","num":"0016"},"figref":["FIG. 7","FIG. 1"]},{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0018","num":"0017"},"figref":"FIG. 8"},{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0019","num":"0018"},"figref":["FIG. 9","FIG. 8"],"b":["9","9"]},{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0020","num":"0019"},"figref":"FIG. 10"},{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0021","num":"0020"},"figref":"FIG. 11"},{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0022","num":"0021"},"figref":["FIG. 12","FIG. 11"]},{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0023","num":"0022"},"figref":["FIGS. 13-14","FIG. 11"]},{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0024","num":"0023"},"figref":["FIG. 15","FIGS. 13-14"]},{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0025","num":"0024"},"figref":["FIG. 16","FIG. 15"]},{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0026","num":"0025"},"figref":["FIGS. 17-18","FIG. 15"]},{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0027","num":"0026"},"figref":["FIGS. 19-20","FIGS. 17-18"]},{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0028","num":"0027"},"figref":"FIG. 21"},{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0029","num":"0028"},"figref":["FIG. 22","FIG. 15","FIGS. 17-21"]},{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0030","num":"0029"},"figref":["FIG. 23","FIG. 22"]},{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0031","num":"0030"},"figref":["FIG. 24","FIG. 22"]},{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0032","num":"0031"},"figref":["FIG. 25","FIG. 24"]},{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0033","num":"0032"},"figref":["FIG. 26","FIG. 22"]}]},"DETDESC":[{},{}]}
