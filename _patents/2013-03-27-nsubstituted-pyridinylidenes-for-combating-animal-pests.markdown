Potted rice seedlings were sprayed with 5 ml test solution, air dried, placed in cages and inoculated with 10 adults. Treated rice plants were kept at about 28-29\u00b0 C. and relative humidity of about 50-60%. Percent mortality was recorded after 72 hours.","In this test, compound E-1, and E-5 at 500 ppm showed at least 75% mortality in comparison with untreated controls.","B.6 Rice Brown Plant Hopper ()","Rice seedlings were cleaned and washed 24 hours before spraying.

Potted rice seedlings were sprayed with 5 ml test solution, air dried, placed in cages and inoculated with 10 adults. Treated rice plants were kept at about 28-29\u00b0 C. and relative humidity of about 50-60%. Percent mortality was recorded after 72 hours.","In this test, compound E-1, and E-5 at 500 ppm showed at least 75% mortality in comparison with untreated controls.","B.7 Mediterranean Fruitfly ()","For evaluating control of Mediterranean fruitfly () the test unit consists of microtiter plates containing an insect diet and 50-80 eggs.","The compounds were formulated using a solution containing 75% v\/v water and 25% v\/v DMSO. Different concentrations of formulated compounds were sprayed onto the insect diet at 5 \u03bcl, using a custom built micro atomizer, at two replications.","After application, microtiter plates were incubated at about 28\u00b11\u00b0 C. and about 80\u00b15% relative humidity for 5 days. Egg and larval mortality was then visually assessed.","In this test, compound E-1, and E-5 at 2500 ppm showed at least 75% mortality in comparison with untreated controls.","Further biological assays, with which the biological activity of the compounds of formula I of the present invention may be assessed are described in the following.","B.8 Cotton Aphid ()","The active compounds are prepared and formulated in 50% acetone: 50% water (vol:vol) in glass vials.","Cotton seeds are placed in the glass vials and mixed with the formulated compounds. Solvent blank control seeds are treated with 50% acetone: 50% water (vol:vol). Treated seeds are then air-dried. The cotton seeds are planted in Metro Mix\u00ae potting mix in pots, 2 seeds per pot, and maintained in the greenhouse.","Seedling plants are thinned to one plant per pot. At the cotyledon stage, six plants are infested with by manually transferring circa 25 aphids to each plant on a piece of leaf tissue cut from a donor plant infested with aphids. Infested plants are maintained on light carts. Four days after infestation, live aphids on each plant are counted.","B.9 Silverleaf Whitefly ()","The active compounds are formulated in cyclohexanone as a 10,000 ppm solution supplied in tubes. The tubes are inserted into an automated electrostatic sprayer equipped with an atomizing nozzle and they serve as stock solutions for which lower dilutions are made in 50% acetone:50% water (v\/v). A nonionic surfactant (Kinetic\u00ae) is included in the solution at a volume of 0.01% (v\/v).","Cotton plants at the cotyledon stage (one plant per pot) are sprayed by an automated electrostatic plant sprayer equipped with an atomizing spray nozzle. The plants are dried in the sprayer fume hood and then removed from the sprayer. Each pot is placed into a plastic cup and about 10 to 12 whitefly adults (approximately 3-5 days old) are introduced. The insects are collected using an aspirator and a nontoxic Tygon\u00ae tubing connected to a barrier pipette tip. The tip, containing the collected insects, is then gently inserted into the soil containing the treated plant, allowing insects to crawl out of the tip to reach the foliage for feeding. Cups are covered with a reusable screened lid. Test plants are maintained in a growth room at about 25\u00b0 C. and about 20-40% relative humidity for 3 days, avoiding direct exposure to fluorescent light (24 hour photoperiod) to prevent trapping of heat inside the cup. Mortality is assessed 3 days after treatment, compared to untreated control plants.","B.10 Boll Weevil ()","For evaluating control of boll weevil () the test unit consist of 96-well-microtiter plates containing an insect diet and 5-10 eggs.","The compounds are formulated using a solution containing 75% v\/v water and 25% v\/v DMSO.
