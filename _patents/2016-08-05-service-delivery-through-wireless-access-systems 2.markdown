A wireless communication terminal having an active Internet connection established through a WLAN can generally access all services that the Internet is able to provide. Service as employed herein refers to any computer-implemented service, e.g. information service, entertainment service, booking service, reporting service, monitoring service, payment service, authentication service, communication service and others.","In addition to an active Internet connection, accessing such services generally requires some kind of prior configuration of the communication terminal, e.g. installing a software application that includes some embedded network addresses for communicating with predefined distant servers, or inputting a URL in a web-browser application.","The providing of services through Wi-Fi communication terminals without the need to have an active Internet connection has also been proposed in the art in some rare cases. The publication -802.11 -V. GUPTA et al. in International Journal of Computer Applications, Vol. 63, No 2, February 2013 discloses a location specific advertisement service that relies on advertisements, coupons, discounts and commercial announcements being overloaded in beacon frames of a WLAN access point and therefore broadcasted in the coverage area of the access point. Such advertisement service is inherently limited in purpose and usability.","Aspects of the invention are based on the idea of offering a broad selection of computer-implemented services through a wireless communication terminal lacking an active Internet connection. Aspects of the invention are based on the idea of offering computer-implemented services through a wireless communication terminal in a way that limits the amount of prior configuration needed at the wireless communication terminal.","Aspects of the invention stem for the observation that situations exist in which it would be desirable to be able to launch a software application on a wireless communication terminal even though the software application is not yet installed and no network connection is yet available.","Such situations are illustrated in the two examples below.","A local Wi-Fi network is deployed in a hospital and publicly accessible for visitors' wireless communication terminals to connect to the Internet or to a private network. The hospital administration develops a map assistance software application or web-service to help visitors find their way in the buildings and facilities. A conventional method for accessing such software application or web-service consists in firstly connecting the wireless communication terminal to the Wi-Fi network, secondly scanning a QR code which redirects the web-browser application running on the wireless communication terminal towards the hospital web-servers or towards a web-portal from which the application may be downloaded and, thirdly installing and launching the application on the wireless communication terminal. However, it is observed that the user experience would be improved by enabling the user to learn about and select this map assistance service prior to connecting to the Wi-Fi network and to have it launched as soon as the network connectivity is established.","A local Wi-Fi network is deployed in an airport and publicly accessible for passengers' wireless communication terminals to connect to the Internet or to a private network. Several software applications related to the airport context are made available through this Wi-Fi network: application for getting the flights time-schedule, application for checking the arrivals, for finding one's way, for booking a taxi, etc. Instead of downloading all these applications once connected to the Wi-Fi network, it would be desirable for an end-user to be able to select one of these applications prior to establishing the Wi-Fi connection and to have it launched as soon as the connection is established.","Accordingly, the invention is based on the idea of enabling an end-user to select an application layer service (i.e. OSI Layer 7) directly from the medium connection layer (OSI network Layer 2). In embodiments, the invention enables to select an application that is not yet installed on a communication terminal prior to any network connection and to automatically launch the application with minimal further actions.","In an embodiment, the invention provides a wireless access system comprising:","A radio interface,","A data repository storing a directory of available services consisting of a set of service records, wherein each service record comprises a service identifier and a network address of an application server suitable for delivering application data corresponding to a computer-implemented service,\n\nA control module configured to:\n\nParse an association request received through the radio interface to detect a service identifier carried in the association request,\n\nLook up the directory of available services for retrieving a service record matching the detected service identifier,\n\nGenerate and send an association response to a source of the association request through the radio interface, wherein the association response comprises a link to the network address found in the matching service record, and\n\nProvide network connectivity between the source of the association request and the application server associated to the network address.\n","According to embodiments, such a wireless access system can comprise one or more of the features below.","In embodiments, each service record further comprises a service descriptor for describing the service to an end-user and wherein the control module is further configured to:","broadcast beacon signals through the radio interface, wherein the beacon signals include a service advertisement for a or each service record of the directory of available services, wherein the service advertisement comprises the service identifier and the service descriptor found in the service record.","In embodiments, the radio interface is configured to send and receive radio signals in accordance with an IEEE 802.11 specification, wherein the association request, association response and beacon signals are configured in accordance with the IEEE 802.11 specification.","In embodiments, the beacon signal includes the service advertisement in a Vendor Specific field of the beacon signal.","In embodiments, the or each service record further comprises at least one of a traffic requirement of the computer-implemented service, a Quality-of-Service (QoS) requirement of the computer-implemented service, an operating-system (OS) requirement of the computer-implemented service, a version number of the computer-implemented service, a security level of the computer-implemented service and a price of the computer-implemented service. In embodiments, the or each service advertisement further comprises at least one of the traffic requirement, Quality-of-Service requirement, operating-system requirement, version number, security level and price found in the service record.","In embodiments, the control module is further configured to:","record a source IP address and source MAC address found in the association request, and","filter out a subsequent data packet received through the radio interface and intended to the network address of the application server in response to detecting that the data packet does not originate from the recorded source IP address and source MAC address.","In embodiments, the network address of the application server is a FQDN of the application server.","In embodiments, the link to the network address found in the matching service record points to a local address in the wireless access system, wherein the control module is further configured to operate as a reverse-proxy between the application server and the source of the association request.","In embodiments, the application data comprises software application code encoding a web application executable by a web browser. In embodiments, the application data comprises software application code encoding a software application executable by a processor of the communication terminal under the control of an operating system.","In an embodiment, the invention also provides a communication terminal comprising:","a radio interface,","a WLAN communication module configured to:","generate and send an association request to a wireless access system through the radio interface,","receive an association response from the wireless access system through the radio interface, and","establish IP connectivity with the

application code implementing the selected computer-implemented service,","wherein the WLAN communication module is further configured to:","in response to receiving a service selection command from the service selection module, generate an association request comprising a service identifier which identifies the selected service, and","parse the association response received through the radio interface to detect a link carried in the association response, wherein the link points to a network address of an application server suitable for delivering application data corresponding to the selected computer-implemented service, and","initiate data communication with the network address for downloading the application data.","In an embodiment, the WLAN communication module is further configured to parse beacon signals received through the radio interface, to detect a service advertisement carried in the beacon signals indicative of a service available for selection, and to communicate the service advertisement to the service selection module.","In an embodiment, the service selection module is further configured for generating a graphical user interface for displaying a set of computer-implemented services available for selection.","In an embodiment, the graphical user interface displays a text descriptor for each computer-implemented service available for selection.","In an embodiment, the service selection module is further configured to filter the services available for selection as a function of information carried in the service advertisements and to generate the graphical user interface so as to display the filtered set of computer-implemented services available for selection.","In an embodiment, the information carried in the service advertisements comprises at least one of a traffic requirement of the computer-implemented service, a Quality-of-Service (QoS) requirement of the computer-implemented service, an operating-system requirement of the computer-implemented service, a version number of the computer-implemented service, a security level of the computer-implemented service and a price of the computer-implemented

technologies including, but not limited to, Code Division Multiple Access (CDMA), Global System for Mobile Communications (GSM), Universal Mobile Telecommunications System (UMTS), Time Division

embodiments of the present invention may communicate using various media including, but not limited to, radio, infrared, laser, cable connection, and the like.","A WLAN infrastructure consists of at least one wireless Access Points (AP), i.e. APs  and  in the exemplary embodiment illustrated in , and a data storage device for storing a directory of services available in the WLAN infrastructure, i.e. directories  and  in the exemplary embodiment illustrated in . In a non-illustrated embodiment, a WLAN infrastructure comprises a plurality of APs interconnected through an aggregation network, e.g. Ethernet LAN. The data storage device may be provided in an AP or as a separate device connected to the AP and may include any kind of computer-readable medium, e.g. removable or non-removable, such as a hard drive, Read-only memory (ROM), Random access memory (RAM), optical disc, etc.","The operations of the communication system illustrated in  will be best understood with the following illustrative use-case.","We assume that there are two separate WLAN infrastructures  and  advertising different applications in a same geographical area, e. g. a building such as a railway station. More precisely, WLAN infrastructure  advertises two applications identified by their respective identifiers app_Id and app_Id and short descriptions. Similarly WLAN infrastructure  advertises two applications identified by their respective identifiers app_Id and app_Id and short descriptions.","The description of the application app_Id may be \u201cGet the train arrivals time in the railway station\u201d. The description of the application app_Id may be \u201cCall for free within railway station area\u201d.","In addition, each WLAN infrastructure broadcasts an identifier so that it can be identified by communication terminals, e.g. the Extended Service Set Identification (ESSID) according to IEEE 802.11 specifications. More precisely, WLAN infrastructure  advertises \u201cWiFi\u201d and WLAN infrastructure  advertises \u201cWiFi\u201d as the ESSID.","In this context, the following scenario can be implemented. A user in possession of communication terminal , e.g. a mobile phone, is located in a railway station and wants to get the train arrival times in this station. This railway station hosts two WLAN infrastructures  and . When under the coverage of WLAN infrastructures  and , the communication terminal  will detect and notify the user that applications app_Id, app_Id and app_Id are available for use with their corresponding descriptions such as for instance \u201cGet the train arrival times in the railway station\u201d for app_Id. The communication terminal  will provide a selection interface for the end user to select the desired application and desired WLAN infrastructure, i.e. application app_id in the present case and e.g. WiFi. Then, the communication terminal  starts the association procedure with WLAN infrastructure  and gets the information from WLAN infrastructure  that the application app_Id is a web application available at a certain URL, e.g. \u201chttps:\/\/trains.citystation.eu\/arrivals\u201d. Once connected to WLAN infrastructure , the WLAN communication module of communication terminal  requests the mobile operating system (OS) to launch the embedded web browser and navigate to the URL received during the association procedure. Since the communication terminal  already indicated that it wanted to use the application app_Id at the time of requesting association to the WLAN infrastructure , the WLAN infrastructure , when receiving the web request from the communication terminal  will grant access to the corresponding resource by reverse-proxy-ing the web request towards the web server mapped to the above-mentioned URL.","This scenario is depicted in more details in the flow charts of . These flow charts will be described in four main sequences of method steps.","Application Publication (Sequence )","A publishing API is offered by each WLAN infrastructure  and . This API is used by application editors to publish and register their applications onto the WLAN infrastructure, e.g. from the management station  into the service directories  and  in the exemplary embodiment illustrated in . The publishing API may also be manually accessed by a network administrator configuring the WLAN infrastructure with a network configuration tool. The publishing API allows the editor to specify at least a short description of the application to be registered and a network address or Uniform Resource Locator (URL) from which the application code may be obtained. A unique identifier of the application must also be specified at the time of generating the service record in the directory of available services. Such identifier may be generated manually by the editor or automatically by the WLAN infrastructure.","In further embodiments, the service record may include further characteristics.
