Field of the Invention","The present invention relates to a tool and method of operation thereof used in operative cooperation with a computer to allow a user to review and\/or alter electronic documents having different machine or native language, and each document possibly having a different format.","2. Description of the Related Art","The obtainment of a paperless office or a paperless development of an engineering task has long been predicted, but has not yet been realized. Although paper usage has been reduced in some organizations, it has increased in others and whereas computers have helped in managing paper work, they have made it easy to turn out even more documents. Further, because of the many users or engineers involved in the operation of an office or in the development of an engineering task, the utilization of computers creates a still further problem in that the documents produced are commonly generated by computer having different native language each of which may have different formats requiring specialized handling for each document.","The goal of a paperless office or a paperless development of an engineering task may be more readily realized if a tool is provided to allow the user or engineer to review and\/alter the electronic documents. Unfortunately, because of the number of documents involved and the number of different formats inherent in these documents, the utilization of a single tool for modifying or changing electronic documents is hindered. It is desired that a single tool be provided for use with the operative cooperation of a computer to allow a user to review and\/or alter electronic documents generated in different native languages having different formats.","It is a primary object of the present invention to provide for a tool used in operative cooperation with a computer to allow a user to review and\/or alter different electronic documents each having different formats.","It is a further object of the present invention to provide a scheme whereby changes to the document may be accomplished by users utilizing a network.","It is a further object of the present invention to provide for a tool used to review and\/or alter electronic documents and to notify the associated authority of the changes about to be made before the changes are actually accomplished.","It is a further object of the present invention to provide for a tool to allow a user to review native documents, accept or reject change requests to the documents, notify the submitter of a requested change, and pass the change request to an associated authorization agency before the changes are actually accomplished.","The invention is directed to a mark-up tool and a method of operation thereof used in operative cooperation with a computer to allow a user to review and\/or alter a plurality of electronic native documents each possibly having a different format.","The mark-up tool comprises a selector, a first converter, and an editor. The selector is used for selecting and retrieving one of the stored plurality of electronic native documents. The first converter is used to convert the native documents to an electronic document having a common format. The mark-up tool is used for reviewing and changing the selected document with the portion to be changed of the document highlighted in a color rectangle.","Referring to the drawings, wherein the same reference number indicates the same element throughout, there is shown in  a block diagram of an arrangement or system  reducing or even eliminating the amount of paper work involved in the conduct of business in an office or in an engineering project brought to fruition by engineers. The present invention is primarily related to a mark-up tool  that is used in an operative relationship with a computer .","The computer  may be of a conventional type having a keyboard  that is serviced by a communication channel , a mouse  that is serviced by a communication channel , a storage means  that is serviced by a communication channel generally identified by reference number  and comprised of signal paths A, B, and C, a display means  that is serviced by a communication channel , and a printer  that is serviced by a communication channel . Preferably, the computer  services a network  comprised of workstations A, B, C, D, E, F, G, and H by way of a communications channel .","The mark-up tool  handles multiple files some of which are identified herein by abbreviations given in Table 1, along with a general description thereof.",{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0022","num":"0021"},"tables":{"@attributes":{"id":"TABLE-US-00001","num":"00001"},"table":{"@attributes":{"frame":"none","colsep":"0","rowsep":"0"},"tgroup":{"@attributes":{"align":"left","colsep":"0","rowsep":"0","cols":"3"},"colspec":[{"@attributes":{"colname":"offset","colwidth":"21pt","align":"left"}},{"@attributes":{"colname":"1","colwidth":"77pt","align":"left"}},{"@attributes":{"colname":"2","colwidth":"119pt","align":"left"}}],"thead":{"row":[{"entry":[{},"TABLE 1"]},{"entry":[{},{"@attributes":{"namest":"offset","nameend":"2","align":"center","rowsep":"1"}}]},{"entry":[{},"ABBREVIATION","GENERAL DESCRIPTION"]},{"entry":[{},{"@attributes":{"namest":"offset","nameend":"2","align":"center","rowsep":"1"}}]}]},"tbody":{"@attributes":{"valign":"top"},"row":[{"entry":[{},"doc","Microsoft Word file extension"]},{"entry":[{},"xls","Microsoft Excel file"]},{"entry":[{},{},"extension"]},{"entry":[{},"pdf","Portable Document Format"]},{"entry":[{},"ps","Postscript"]},{"entry":[{},"mkz","EDMS Markup Tool file"]},{"entry":[{},{},"extension (markup zip file)"]},{"entry":[{},"mku","EDMS Markup Tool file update"]},{"entry":[{},{},"extension (extension for"]},{"entry":[{},{},"markup file)"]},{"entry":[{},"mkd","EDMS Markup data file"]},{"entry":[{},{},"extension"]},{"entry":[{},{"@attributes":{"namest":"offset","nameend":"2","align":"center","rowsep":"1"}}]}]}}}}},"The mark-up tool  comprises a plurality of program segments associated with a selector , a converter , an editor , a re-converter , a director , and a compressor . The program segments of the mark-up tool  may be written in the program language of VC++6.0\u00ae which is a trademark of the Microsoft Corporation. In general, the selector  receives, via signal path A, a list of files from storage means  and transfers the users selected file to converter , via signal path . The converter , via signal path , transfers compressed mkz file that includes ps, mkd, and native document to the editor .","The editor  transfers, via communication channel , markup, surface, and color-coded markup overlays, to the display . The editor  receives, via communication channel , user entered markup via keyboard , and also receives, via communication channel , user commands from the mouse . The editor  also transfers, via communication channel , markup document with overlays or markup summary and reports to the printer . Still further, the editor  transfers, via signal path , updated mku file and attachments to the compressor .","The compressor  transfers, via signal path , compressed mkz file that includes ps, mkd, mku, and attachments to the director  which, in turn, transfers, via signal path B, the request to store .mkz file to the storage means . The storage means , via signal path C, transfers markups from .mku to native file and store information to the re-converter .","The mark-up tool  allows users to use one single tool and one common procedure to identify, change, review, and update electronic documents that are stored in the storage means . The mark-up tool  provides a single tool having intuitive mark-up capabilities that does not require knowledge of native document applications each of which may have a different format, such as those derived by application programs Word, Excel, or other applications installed in to the computer .","In general, the selector program segment  is used for selecting and retrieving one of a plurality of electronic native documents stored in storage means .","The converter  program segment is used for changing the native document along with its format to a common format. In one embodiment the common format is a postscript (p.s.) file. In the operation of the converter , native documents are pre-converted into .ps files. The .ps files are combined with user created .mkd files, and, optionally, the native document, and compressed to make an .mkz file. The .mkz files are stored on a web site or desktop PC, such as found in network . Use of the .ps common file format makes the mark-up tool  independent of native file formats.","The editor  program segment is provided for viewing and\/or changing the selected electronic document. More particularly, the editor  opens and uncompresses the .mkz file, accepts user markups, writes user markups to an .mku file, and finally, combines and compresses the .ps, .mkd, .mku, and attachments into an updated .mkz file.","The re-converter  program segment is provided for changing the common format of the selected document back to the format of the native document that was originally retrieved from the storage means . In the operation of the re-converter , the user manually transfers, using the mark-up tool and the native document editor, markups from the markup tool  to the native document.","The director  program segment saves the .mkz file to storage means .","The compressor  is preferably used for compressing the data of the native document after it has been changed to its common format.","Most of the displays related to the present invention, utilize animation for projection of the detailed component status. The displays change as the status changes which provides a real-time reporting of the state of the asset and its readiness. This maximizes the human-machine comprehension so that response time is minimized. The eye is very adept at detection of changes.","In operation, the mark-up of the electronic document being displayed on display means  is accomplished by using the mouse  to point to the top-left of the area to be marked, then holding down the left mouse button, dragging the now pointer to the bottom right of the area to be changed or reviewed, and then releasing the left mouse button. A color-coded rectangular is provided that now surrounds the area to be marked.","The color and appearance of the rectangle indicates the state of the mark-up (blue rectangle=submitter, green rectangle with dash checked stripes=applied, a red rectangle with dashed X's stripes=rejected, a green rectangle with checked stripes=approved, and a red rectangle with an X stripe=disapproval.","On releasing the left mouse button, a mark-up dialogue containing the document to be reviewed or altered, is displayed and allows the user to make such changes.","After the user makes his changes, an E-mail address, comments and the mark-up state to be entered changes appears on the display means and is transmitted to one of the users of the network . The color of the rectangle is changes by clicking a corresponding state radio button (not shown) appearing on the display means . Also when entering commands, one of the state radio buttons may be checked before commas can be entered. When marked areas overlap, clicking the outermost (last) mark-up, causes the editor  dialogues to be displayed chronologically from the oldest to the most recently applied mark-up. Clicking the okay\/next button advances to the next mark-up.
