{"@attributes":{"id":"description"},"BRFSUM":[{},{}],"heading":["BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION","SUMMARY OF THE INVENTION","DETAILED DESCRIPTION OF THE PREFERRED EMBODIMENT"],"p":["1. Technical Field","The present invention relates in general to improved grid computing and in particular to automated bidding for virtual job requests within a grid environment. Still more particularly, the present invention relates to responding to virtual grid job requests for grid resources by calculating the capacity of grid resources to handle the workload requirements for the virtual requests, where a bid for handling the virtual job request can be generated based on the capacity of the grid environment to handle the workload requirements.","2. Description of the Related Art","Ever since the first connection was made between two computer systems, new ways of transferring data, resources, and other information between two computer systems via a connection continue to develop. In typical network architectures, when two computer systems are exchanging data via a connection, one of the computer systems is considered a client sending requests and the other is considered a server processing the requests and returning results. In an effort to increase the speed at which requests are handled, server systems continue to expand in size and speed. Further, in an effort to handle peak periods when multiple requests are arriving every second, server systems are often joined together as a group and requests are distributed among the grouped servers. Multiple methods of grouping servers have developed such as clustering, multi-system shared data (sysplex) environments, and enterprise systems. With a cluster of servers, one server is typically designated to manage distribution of incoming requests and outgoing responses. The other servers typically operate in parallel to handle the distributed requests from clients. Thus, one of multiple servers in a cluster may service a client request without the client detecting that a cluster of servers is processing the request.","Typically, servers or groups of servers operate on a particular network platform, such as Unix or some variation of Unix, and provide a hosting environment for running applications. Each network platform may provide functions ranging from database integration, clustering services, and security to workload management and problem determination. Each network platform typically offers different implementations, semantic behaviors, and application programming interfaces (APIs).","Merely grouping servers together to expand processing power, however, is a limited method of improving efficiency of response times in a network. Thus, increasingly, within a company network, rather than just grouping servers, servers and groups of server systems are organized as distributed resources. There is an increased effort to collaborate, share data, share cycles, and improve other modes of interaction among servers within a company network and outside the company network. Further, there is an increased effort to outsource nonessential elements from one company network to that of a service provider network. Moreover, there is a movement to coordinate resource sharing between resources that are not subject to the same management system, but still address issues of security, policy, payment, and membership. For example, resources on an individual's desktop are not typically subject to the same management system as resources of a company server cluster. Even different administrative groups within a company network may implement distinct management systems.","The problems with decentralizing the resources available from servers and other computing systems operating on different network platforms, located in different regions, with different security protocols and each controlled by a different management system, has led to the development of Grid technologies using open standards for operating a grid environment. Grid environments support the sharing and coordinated use of diverse resources in dynamic, distributed, virtual organizations. A virtual organization is created within a grid environment when a selection of resources, from geographically distributed systems operated by different organizations with differing policies and management systems, is organized to handle a job request.","One important application of a grid environment is that companies implementing an enterprise computing environment can access external grid computing \u201cfarms\u201d. Sending jobs to a grid computing farms is one way to outsource job execution. The grid computing farms may include groups of grid resources accessible for executing grid jobs received from multiple customers.","A limitation of current grid computing farms is that the process for attaining bids from multiple grid computing farms is time consuming and inefficient. In particular, a customer needing to send jobs to a grid computing farm will typically want the least costly grid computing farm from among multiple available grid farm providers to process the grid jobs. However, to determine the most competitive bid from among the multiple available grid farm providers, a customer must contact a representative of each grid computing farm, provide a description of the type of grid resources needed and receive a bid from the representative of each grid farm. Requiring a customer to contact a representative of each grid computing farm and go through a bidding process is inefficient for the customer and for the grid computing farm vendor.","Therefore, in view of the foregoing, it would be advantageous to provide a method, system, and program for receiving virtual grid job requests and automatically calculating a bid for performing the grid job, such that the consumer and the grid resource vendor can more efficiently determine whether a particular grid environment is able to handle a virtual grid job request and provide on the spot prices for use of a grid environment. In particular, it would be advantageous to provide a method, system, and program for calculating the workload associated with a virtual grid job request so that an accurate determination of the ability of the grid environment to handle a virtual grid job request is quickly determines and a price can be calculated based on the estimated workload of the virtual grid job request.","In view of the foregoing, the present invention in general provides for automation for access to grids and in particular provides for automated bidding for virtual job requests within a grid environment. Still more particularly, the present invention relates to responding to virtual grid job requests for grid resources by calculating the capacity of grid resources to handle the workload requirements for the virtual requests, where a bid for handling the virtual job request can be generated based on the capacity of the grid environment to handle the workload requirements.","According to one embodiment, a bid controller receives a virtual job request for processing a job within a grid environment from a client system. The bid controller determines the total required workload for the virtual job request. Then, the bid controller calculates a capacity of the grid environment to handle the total required workload, such that a bid for performing the job is enabled to be automatically generated responsive to the virtual job request based on the capacity of the grid environment to handle the total required workload.","The bid controller may be a resource within or outside the grid environment for which a bid is determined in response to receiving a virtual job request. The bid controller may determine bids for multiple grid environments or a single grid environment.","In calculating the total required workload for the virtual job request, the bid controller may calculate a total time available for the job to execute within the grid environment, for accessing data required for the job, and for returning a result of the job from the grid environment to a client system. In addition, as part of the total required workload, the bid controller may calculate a total resource requirement for processing the job, such as a hardware resource requirement, a software resource requirement, or a network resource requirement.","In calculating the capacity of the grid environment to handle the total required workload, the bid controller may determine a selection of available resources from among the multiple resources available to the grid environment that are authorized to handle the virtual job request. In particular, in adding resource to the selection of available resources, the bid controller determines whether the virtual job request authorizes use of resources available from outside the grid environment or capacity on demand resources.","Referring now to the drawings and in particular to , there is depicted one embodiment of a computer system which may be implemented in a grid environment and in which the present invention may be implemented. As will be further described, the grid environment includes multiple computer systems managed to provide resources. Additionally, as will be further described, the present invention may be executed in a variety of computer systems, including a variety of computing systems, mobile systems, and electronic devices operating under a number of different operating systems managed within a grid environment.","In one embodiment, computer system  includes a bus  or other device for communicating information within computer system , and at least one processing device such as processor , coupled to bus  for processing information. Bus  may include low-latency and higher latency paths connected by bridges and adapters and controlled within computer system  by multiple bus controllers. When implemented as a server system, computer system  typically includes multiple processors designed to improve network servicing power.","Processor  may be a general-purpose processor such as IBM's PowerPC\u2122 processor that, during normal operation, processes data under the control of operating system and application software accessible from a dynamic storage device such as random access memory (RAM)  and a static storage device such as Read Only Memory (ROM) . The operating system may provide a graphical user interface (GUI) to the user. In one embodiment, application software contains machine executable instructions that when executed on processor  carry out the operations depicted in the flowcharts of  and others operations described herein. Alternatively, the steps of the present invention might be performed by specific hardware components that contain hardwired logic for performing the steps, or by any combination of programmed computer components and custom hardware components.","The present invention may be provided as a computer program product, included on a machine-readable medium having stored thereon the machine executable instructions used to program computer system  to perform a process according to the present invention. The term \u201cmachine-readable medium\u201d as used herein includes any medium that participates in providing instructions to processor  or other components of computer system  for execution. Such a medium may take many forms including, but not limited to, non-volatile media, volatile media, and transmission media. Common forms of non-volatile media include, for example, a floppy disk, a flexible disk, a hard disk, magnetic tape or any other magnetic medium, a compact disc ROM (CD-ROM) or any other optical medium, punch cards or any other physical medium with patterns of holes, a programmable ROM (PROM), an erasable PROM (EPROM), electrically EPROM (EEPROM), a flash memory, any other memory chip or cartridge, or any other medium from which computer system  can read and which is suitable for storing instructions. In the present embodiment, an example of a non-volatile medium is mass storage device  which as depicted is an internal component of computer system , but will be understood to also be provided by an external device. Volatile media include dynamic memory such as RAM . Transmission media include coaxial cables, copper wire or fiber optics, including the wires that comprise bus . Transmission media can also take the form of acoustic or light waves, such as those generated during radio frequency or infrared data communications.","Moreover, the present invention may be downloaded as a computer program product, wherein the program instructions may be transferred from a remote virtual resource, such as a virtual resource , to requesting computer system  by way of data signals embodied in a carrier wave or other propagation medium via a network link  (e.g. a modem or network connection) to a communications interface  coupled to bus . Virtual resource  may include a virtual representation of the resources accessible from a single system or systems, wherein multiple systems may each be considered discrete sets of resources operating on independent platforms, but coordinated as a virtual resource by a grid manager. Communications interface  provides a two-way data communications coupling to network link  that may be connected, for example, to a local area network (LAN), wide area network (WAN), or an Internet Service Provider (ISP) that provide access to network . In particular, network link  may provide wired and\/or wireless network communications to one or more networks, such as network , through which use of virtual resources, such as virtual resource , is accessible as provided by a grid management system . Grid management system  may be part of multiple types of networks, including a peer-to-peer network, or may be part of a single computer system, such as computer system .","As one example, network  may refer to the worldwide collection of networks and gateways that use a particular protocol, such as Transmission Control Protocol (TCP) and Internet Protocol (IP), to communicate with one another. Network  uses electrical, electromagnetic, or optical signals that carry digital data streams. The signals through the various networks and the signals on network link  and through communication interface , which carry the digital data to and from computer system , are exemplary forms of carrier waves transporting the information. It will be understood that alternate types of networks, combinations of networks, and infrastructures of networks may be implemented.","When implemented as a server system, computer system  typically includes multiple communication interfaces accessible via multiple peripheral component interconnect (PCI) bus bridges connected to an input\/output controller. In this manner, computer system  allows connections to multiple network computers.","Additionally, although not depicted, multiple peripheral components and internal\/external devices may be added to computer system , connected to multiple controllers, adapters, and expansion slots coupled to one of the multiple levels of bus . For example, a display device, audio device, keyboard, or cursor control device may be added as a peripheral component.","Those of ordinary skill in the art will appreciate that the hardware depicted in  may vary. Furthermore, those of ordinary skill in the art will appreciate that the depicted example is not meant to imply architectural limitations with respect to the present invention.","With reference now to , a block diagram illustrates one embodiment of the general types of components within a grid environment. In the present example, the components of a grid environment  include a client system  interfacing with a grid management system  which interfaces with server clusters , servers , workstations and desktops , data storage systems , and networks . For purposes of illustration, the network locations and types of networks connecting the components within grid environment  are not depicted. It will be understood, however, that the components within grid environment  may reside atop a network infrastructure architecture that may be implemented with multiple types of networks overlapping one another. Network infrastructure may range from multiple large enterprise systems to a peer-to-peer system to a single computer system. Further, it will be understood that the components within grid environment  are merely representations of the types of components within a grid environment. A grid environment may simply be encompassed in a single computer system or may encompass multiple enterprises of systems. In addition, it will be understood that grid environment  may be provided by a grid vendor, where a cost for use of resources within grid environment  may be calculated based on the amount of time required for a grid job to execute or the actual amount of resources used, for example.","The central goal of a grid environment, such as grid environment  is organization and delivery of resources from multiple discrete systems viewed as virtual resource . Client system , server clusters , servers , workstations and desktops , data storage systems , networks  and the systems creating grid management system  may be heterogeneous and regionally distributed with independent management systems, but enabled to exchange information, resources, and services through a grid infrastructure enabled by grid management system . Further, server clusters , servers , workstations and desktops , data storage systems , and networks  may be geographically distributed across countries and continents or locally accessible to one another.","In the example, client system  interfaces with grid management system . Client system  may represent any computing system sending requests to grid management system . In particular, client system  may send virtual job requests and jobs to grid management system . Further, while in the present embodiment client system  is depicted as accessing grid environment  with a request, in alternate embodiments client system  may also operate within grid environment .","While the systems within virtual resource  are depicted in parallel, in reality, the systems may be part of a hierarchy of systems where some systems within virtual resource  may be local to client system , while other systems require access to external networks. Additionally, it is important to note, that systems depicted within virtual resources  may be physically encompassed within client system .","One function of grid management system  is to manage virtual job requests and jobs from client system  and control distribution of each job to a selection of computing systems of virtual resource  for use of particular resources at the available computing systems within virtual resource . From the perspective of client system , however, virtual resource  handles the request and returns the result without differentiating between which computing system in virtual resource  actually performed the request.","To implement grid environment , grid management system  facilitates grid services. Grid services may be designed according to multiple architectures, including, but not limited to, the Open Grid Services Architecture (OGSA). In particular, grid management system  refers to the management environment which creates a grid by linking computing systems into a heterogeneous network environment characterized by sharing of resources through grid services.","In one example, a grid service is invoked when grid management system  receives a virtual job request that specifies the parameters for processing ajob. The grid service is a bid controller that determines a total workload required for the virtual job request and calculates a capacity of grid environment  to handle the total workload required. The bid controller also determines a bid for performing the job specified by the virtual job request based on the capacity of grid environment  to handle the total workload required.","Referring now to , a block diagram illustrates one example of an architecture that may be implemented in a grid environment. As depicted, an architecture  includes multiple layers of functionality. As will be further described, the present invention is a process which may be implemented in one or more layers of an architecture, such as architecture , which is implemented in a grid environment, such as the grid environment described in . It is important to note that architecture  is just one example of an architecture that may be implemented in a grid environment and in which the present invention may be implemented. Further, it is important to note that multiple architectures may be implemented within a grid environment.","Within the layers of architecture , first, a physical and logical resources layer  organizes the resources of the systems in the grid. Physical resources include, but are not limited to, servers, storage media, and networks. The logical resources virtualize and aggregate the physical layer into usable resources such as operating systems, processing power, memory, I\/O processing, file systems, database managers, directories, memory managers, and other resources.","Next, a web services layer  provides an interface between grid services  and physical and logical resources . Web services layer  implements service interfaces including, but not limited to, Web Services Description Language (WSDL), Simple Object Access Protocol (SOAP), and eXtensible mark-up language (XML) executing atop an Internet Protocol (IP) or other network transport layer. Further, the Open Grid Services Infrastructure (OSGI) standard  builds on top of current web services  by extending web services  to provide capabilities for dynamic and manageable Web services required to model the resources of the grid. In particular, by implementing OGSI standard  with web services , grid services  designed using OGSA are interoperable. In alternate embodiments, other infrastructures or additional infrastructures may be implemented a top web services layer .","Grid services layer  includes multiple services. For example, grid services layer  may include grid services designed using OGSA, such that a uniform standard is implemented in creating grid services. Alternatively, grid services may be designed under multiple architectures. Grid services can be grouped into four main functions. It will be understood, however, that other functions may be performed by grid services.","First, a resource management service  manages the use of the physical and logical resources. Resources may include, but are not limited to, processing resources, memory resources, and storage resources. Management of these resources includes scheduling jobs, distributing jobs, and managing the retrieval of the results for jobs. Resource management service  monitors resource loads and distributes jobs to less busy parts of the grid to balance resource loads and absorb unexpected peaks of activity. In particular, a user may specify preferred performance levels so that resource management service  distributes jobs to maintain the preferred performance levels within the grid.","Second, information services  manages the information transfer and communication between computing systems within the grid. Since multiple communication protocols may be implemented, information services  manages communications across multiple networks utilizing multiple types of communication protocols.","Third, a data management service  manages data transfer and storage within the grid. In particular, data management service  may move data to nodes within the grid where a job requiring the data will execute. A particular type of transfer protocol, such as Grid File Transfer Protocol (GridFTP), may be implemented.","Finally, a security service  applies a security protocol for security at the connection layers of each of the systems operating within the grid. Security service  may implement security protocols, such as Open Secure Socket Layers (SSL), to provide secure transmissions. Further, security service  may provide a single sign-on mechanism, so that once a user is authenticated, a proxy certificate is created and used when performing actions within the grid for the user.","Multiple services may work together to provide several key functions of a grid computing system. In a first example, computational tasks are distributed within a grid. Data management service  may divide up a computation task into separate grid services requests of packets of data that are then distributed by and managed by resource management service . The results are collected and consolidated by data management system . In a second example, the storage resources across multiple computing systems in the grid are viewed as a single virtual data storage system managed by data management service  and monitored by resource management service .","An applications layer  includes applications that use one or more of the grid services available in grid services layer . Advantageously, applications interface with the physical and logical resources  via grid services layer  and web services , such that multiple heterogeneous systems can interact and interoperate.","With reference now to , there is depicted a block diagram of a grid environment in which virtual job requests are received and automatically replied to in the form of a bid in accordance with the method, system, and program of the present invention. As depicted, a grid client sends virtual job requests to a grid environment . Grid environment may logically include a grid scheduler , grid resources , and a bid controller . Grid resources  represent the available resources providing grid services within grid environment  and a grid scheduler  controls distribution of jobs to grid resources . It will be understood that grid resources , grid scheduler , and bid controller  may execute among multiple server systems distributed within a single network or among multiple networks.","Bid controller , which handles receiving virtual jobs requests and generating bids for completion of the job specified by a virtual job request, may be called as a grid service within grid environment . Alternatively, virtual job requests may be passed to bid controller  from the transport layer or other gatekeeping function of grid environment . Further, bid controller  may execute within a system external to grid environment .","In one embodiment, bid controller  includes a workload calculator . Workload calculator  determines the likely workload required by each virtual job request and calculates the capacity of grid environment  to handle the required workload. Based on the capacity of grid environment  to handle the required workload, a cost for performing the job specified by the virtual job request can be estimated by bid controller  and returned to grid client  in the form of a bid.","While in the embodiment depicted bid controller  is illustrated handling receipt of virtual job requests and automatic determination and return of bids for processing jobs within grid environment , it will be understood that bid controller  may handle receipt of virtual job requests from multiple grid clients and returns bids for processing jobs within multiple grid environments.","Referring now to , there is depicted a block diagram of one embodiment of a workload calculator in accordance with the method, system, and program of the present invention. As depicted, workload calculator  includes a job request parser . Job request parser  receives each virtual job request and may hold the virtual job request in a queue until processing can be performed. Job request parser  may translate values specified by a user in the virtual job request into a unit specified for use in workload calculations.","A resource database  includes a listing of each resource available within the grid environment. In particular, for each resource listing, resource database  may further specify the type of resource, which clients have access to the resource, the resource performance specifications, and the resource platform characteristics. In addition, resource database  may include a listing of resources available to the grid environment from outside the grid environment.","An available resource calculator  may filter through the available resource database  to determine which resources are available for a virtual job request. In particular, as will be further described with reference to , a virtual job request may limit the amount of resources that can be used and may limit whether capacity on demand resources or resources outside the grid environment can be used.","A total workload calculator  may calculate a total workload required for the job specified by the virtual job request. In particular, total workload calculator  may determine a total resource requirement and time requirement for a virtual job request. As will be further described with reference to , the total resource requirement may specify the total amount of hardware, software, or network resources, for example, needed for completion of a job. In addition, as will be further described with reference to , the total time requirement may specify the time available for executing the job within the grid environment, the time available for accessing data required for the job, and the time available for returning a result of the job from the grid environment to a client system. In addition, total workload calculator  may determine other parameters that describe the total workload from additional values specified in a virtual job request.","A capacity calculator  compares the total workload required for a virtual job request with the resources available for the virtual job request and determines the capacity of the grid environment to handle the job specified by the virtual job request. In particular, capacity calculator  may determine whether the grid environment can meet the resource and latency requirements. If the resource and latency requirements of the virtual job request can be met within the grid environment, then capacity controller  determines a total workload factor that can be used by a cost calculator to determine a cost for workload requirement. The workload factor may also indicate the estimated performance available for the job. A bid returned to the client system may include a bid cost and the estimated performance available. In some cases, if the grid environment cannot meet the specific requirements of the virtual job request, but could meet a selection of the virtual job request requirements, then the estimated performance available may indicate the deviation from the virtual job request requirements.","With reference now to , there is depicted an illustrative example of calculations performed within the workload calculator based on a virtual job request in accordance with the method, system, and program of the present invention. As depicted, a virtual job request  includes multiple values designated for specifying the performance requirements for completing a grid job associated with the virtual job request. A table indicated at reference numeral  includes multiple entries that describe calculations that the workload calculator may perform based on the values in virtual job request . It is important to note that while the following description broadly references steps performed by the workload calculator, the sub-calculators within the workload calculator may actually perform one or more of the calculations and evaluations described. Further, it will be understood that the values depicted in virtual job request  are illustrative of the types of values that may be included in a virtual job request for enabling a bid controller to automatically determine the workload and cost associated with performing a requested job. In addition, it will be understood that the functions depicted in the table indicated at reference numeral  are merely illustrative examples of the types of functions that may be performed by the workload calculator.","As illustrated at reference numeral , a \u201cjob time limit\u201d may be specified that indicates the total time for completion of a job or a specific time by which a job must be completed, for example. The workload calculator may use the \u201cjob time limit\u201d to determine whether or not the grid environment has the capacity, in the form of the necessary quantity and type of resources needed, to execute the job in the time specified in the \u201cjob time limit.\u201d In particular, as indicated at reference numeral , the workload calculator may first estimate the total time required to perform the job within the grid environment (TIMEtotal) and then compare that estimated total time with the \u201cjob time limit\u201d specified at reference numeral . In estimating the total time required to perform the job within the grid environment, the total workload (WORKLOADtotal) required may first be calculated. Then, to calculate the total time required to perform the job, the total workload required may be divided by the total resources (RESOURCEtotal) available to handle the workload. If the total time required for performance of the job is greater than or equal to the \u201cjob time limit\u201d than an error is returned indicating that the job cannot be processed within the \u201cjob time limit.\u201d It is important to note that the total resources available may be constrained by other settings in RFP , such as whether capacity on demand resources may be used or whether resource limits within the grid environment are imposed.","As depicted at reference numeral , a \u201ccapacity on demand (CUOD) eligibility\u201d may be specified indicates whether CUOD resources available to the grid environment can be accessed to perform the job. Further, the CUOD eligibility may specify a limit and type of CUOD resources eligible to execute the job. The workload calculator may check the \u201cCUOD eligibility\u201d if the workload calculator determines that the current grid capacity is not sufficient to run the job and in determining the resources available for the virtual job request. In one example, as depicted at reference numeral , if the workload calculator determines that more resources are needed to perform the job, then the workload calculator looks to see if CUOD eligibility is set to \u201cyes\u201d and if so, adds the available CUOD resources (RESOURCEcuod) to the grid resources (RESOURCEbase) to calculate the total available resources to perform the job (RESOURCEtotal).","As illustrated at reference numeral , a \u201cresource limit\u201d may specify whether there is a limit on the available resources that can be used to perform a job. The workload calculator may check the \u201cresource limit\u201d value to set the total resources available for handling a job. In particular, as depicted at reference numeral , if \u201cresource limit\u201d is set, then the total resources available (RESOURCEtotal) is set to the \u201cresource limit\u201d.","As illustrated at reference numeral , a \u201cjob completion requirement\u201d value may be specified that indicates additional requirements for completing a job. For example, if a job is for a database and completion of the job requires output in the form of a new data mart transferred to a client system, then the \u201cjob completion requirements\u201d may specify the time required for return of the data mart to the client system. Thus, as illustrated at reference numeral , the workload calculator may use the \u201cjob completion requirements\u201d (TIMEcomplete) of additional time requirements, storage requirements, processing requirements, and network bandwidth requirements to specify the total time (TIMEtotal) required to complete a job in addition to the time calculated to complete the job itself within the grid environment (TIMEjob). Further, the workload calculator may return an error if the total time required for completion of the job is greater than the time limit.","As depicted at reference numeral , a \u201csoftware platform class\u201d may specify the software platform class of a job. In one example, software platform classes may be specified by defined numbers. For example, an interactive software class may be specified as SW2 and a web hosting application may be specified as SW3. In general, the workload calculator may use the specified software platform class to determine the likely application characteristics of the job. More specifically, as depicted at reference numeral , the workload calculator may use the defined software platform class to determine whether the grid environment has hardware to support the software class. In particular, it is important for the workload calculator to determine whether the job is a batch or interactive because various hardware platforms vary in suitability for software platform types. For example, a zSeries processor may be more efficient for interactive jobs, whereas a pSeries processor may be more efficient for web hosting applications. (zSeries and pSeries are registered trademarks of International Business Machines Corporation).","As illustrated at reference numeral , a \u201chardware platform class\u201d may specify the hardware platform class of a job. In one example, hardware platform classes may be specified by defined numbers. In general, the workload calculator may use the hardware platform class value to determine which grid hardware is available for the job and the throughput characteristics of the hardware type required for the job. More specifically, as depicted at reference numeral , the workload calculator may use the defined hardware platform class to determine whether the preferred hardware platform class is available in the grid environment. If a hardware platform class is not specified at reference numeral , then the workload calculation module may attempt to select the most efficient hardware class based on other specified job characteristics. For example, if a database application is run for a job, and the grid contains preconfigured pSeries 650 nodes running the database application, then the pSeries 650 nodes would be the preferred hardware.","As depicted at reference numeral , a \u201cdata access and transport mechanism\u201d value may specify the movement of or access to data that is required for a job. The workload calculator may use the \u201cdata access and transport mechanism\u201d value with the data size to determine the time and resources associated with any necessary movement of or access to data. For example, as depicted at reference numeral , the virtual job request may specify in the \u201cdata access and transport mechanism\u201d that the grid manager acquire data from the client using the WebFTP application. The workload calculator then evaluates the time and resources required to acquire data from the client using the WebFTP application, taking into account the application transfer rates in conjunction with the data size and hardware throughput.","As illustrated at reference numeral , a \u201cdata size\u201d may be specified for a job. The workload calculator may use the data size in calculating the resources required and time required for the data access specified at reference numeral , as described in the example depicted at reference numeral . In one example, if no value is specified for the \u201cdata size\u201d then the workload calculator may assume that no data transfer is required for the execution of the job.","As depicted at reference numeral , a \u201cperformance and latency requirement\u201d may be specified that indicates the performance and latency requirements for a job. As depicted at reference numeral , the workload calculator may use the \u201cperformance and latency requirement\u201d, along with other values, to determine the resource commitment required for a job. For example, a job with no specific performance requirements may require fewer resources, in quantity and relative power, than an interactive job requiring a response to users in under a second. In another example, if a latency value is specified at reference numeral , then the latency value is compared with specifications of the hardware platform available within the grid environment. More specifically, industry standards such as Standard Performance Evaluation Corporation Integer (SPECint) or SPEC floating point (SPECfp) can be compared with the latency value, or calculations could be made based on other combined RFP submission data such as hardware platform class or job completion limits.","In addition, as depicted at reference numeral , a \u201cgrid sell-off\u201d indicator may be specified to indicate whether the grid workload calculator can consider use of resources outside the grid environment to meet the requirements for the job, as depicted at reference numeral . In one example, if a client does wants a single grid resource vendor to be responsible for data security and job results, the client may not enable a grid sell-off.","Referring now to , there is depicted a high level logic flowchart of a process and program for responding to a virtual job request by calculating a workload required for the request and returning a bid based on the workload required in accordance with the method, system, and program of the present invention. As depicted, the process starts at block  and thereafter proceeds to block . Block  depicts receiving a virtual job request. Next, block  depicts a determination whether the virtual job request is a repetition of a prior job request. If the virtual job request is for a repetitive job, then the process passes to block . Block  depicts returning the current price for the stored job workload determined based on the prior job request, and the process ends. Otherwise, at block , if the virtual job request is not for a repetitive job, then the process passes to block .","Block  depicts a determination whether the virtual job request is eligible for execution. In particular, a determination of eligibility may be made from non-performance virtual job request characteristics. If the virtual job request is not eligible for execution, then the process passes to block . Block  depicts a determination whether it is permissible to submit a bid with exceptions. If it is not permissible, then the process passes to block . Block  depicts returning a no-bid in response to the virtual job request, and the process ends. Otherwise, at block , if it is permissible, then the process passes to block . Block  depicts returning a bid with an exception, and the process ends.","Returning to block , if the virtual job request is eligible for execution, then the process passes to block . Block  depicts parsing the virtual job request for workload related values. Next, block  depicts determining the total workload requirement for the virtual job request. Next, block  depicts determining the selection of available resources for the virtual job request. Thereafter, block  depicts a determination whether the available resources have the capacity to meet the total workload requirement. If the available resources do not have the capacity, then the process passes to block . If the available resources do have the capacity, then the process passes to block .","Block  depicts calculating the total load factor for the job. In particular, the total load factor may include multiple types of values, such as total resource usage, total time usage, or other indicators of the total workload. Next, block  depicts submitting price data and calculated load factor to the cost calculator. Thereafter, block  depicts a determination whether a cost calculated based on the load factor is less than or equal to the price limit. If the cost is not less than or equal to the price limit, then the process passes to block . If the cost is less than or equal to the price limit, then the process passes to block . Block  depicts responding to the virtual job request with the price and updating the grid manager with the price response, and the process ends.","While the invention has been particularly shown and described with reference to a preferred embodiment, it will be understood by those skilled in the art that various changes in form and detail may be made therein without departing from the spirit and scope of the invention."],"brief-description-of-drawings":[{},{}],"description-of-drawings":{"heading":"BRIEF DESCRIPTION OF THE DRAWINGS","p":["The novel features believed aspect of the invention are set forth in the appended claims.
