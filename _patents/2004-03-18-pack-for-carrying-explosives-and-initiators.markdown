{"@attributes":{"id":"description"},"BRFSUM":[{},{}],"heading":["STATEMENT OF GOVERNMENT INTEREST","BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION","SUMMARY OF THE INVENTION","DESCRIPTION OF THE PREFERRED EMBODIMENT"],"p":["The invention described herein may be manufactured and used by or for the Government of the United States of America for governmental purposes without payment of any royalties thereon or therefor.","1. Field of the Invention","The present invention pertains to transporting energetic materials, more particularly to human transport of energetic materials, and most particularly to safe human transport of energetic materials and energetic initiators.","2. Description of the Related Art","Explosive ordnance disposal technicians require energetic materials, such as explosives, as part of their standard equipment in disarming and\/or disposing of unexploded ordnance. In order to employ these energetic materials in the field, energetic initiators, such as blasting caps for explosives, are also used. However, carrying both energetic materials and initiators for such materials poses a significant safety risk. If one of the initiators prematurely actuates, all of the energetic materials carried by the technician may be initiated.","Currently, to address this problem, explosive ordnance disposal technicians hand carry the energetic initiators separately from any energetic materials in metal containers. The metal containers work to contain a premature actuation of initiators and, because the containers are physically separated from the energetic materials, such as the initiators being carried in a technicians hand or attached to a different portion of the technician's body, the risk of prematurely initiating the energetic materials is reduced. However, such metal containers are heavy, currently about twelve pounds, and cumbersome and the requirement to carry such containers separately from the energetic materials is problematic for field use.","Therefore, it is desired to provide a device that allows explosive ordnance disposal technicians to efficiently carry energetic materials and energetic initiators together without creating a significant safety risk or increasing the weight carried by the technician.","The present invention comprises a back worn pack that allows a person to safely transport energetic materials, such as explosives, along with energetic initiators, such as blasting caps, in the same pack while allowing the person free use of both hands. Not only does the invention reduce the risks associated with transporting energetic materials and energetic initiators, but it also significantly reduces physical problems associated with current devices and methods of transporting such materials.","Accordingly, it is an object of this invention to provide a device to assist in safely transporting energetic materials, such as explosives, and energetic initiators, such as blasting caps, within one device.","It is a further object of this invention to provide a device to assist in transporting energetic materials and energetic initiators together that allows free use of a users hands.","A still further object of this invention is to provide a device to assist in transporting energetic materials and energetic initiators that does not significantly increase a user's carry weight.","This invention accomplishes these objectives and other needs related to safe transport of energetic materials and energetic initiators by providing a back worn pack comprising an energetic material section and an energetic initiator section. Both sections have means to be opened to place materials therein and, then, closed. The energetic initiator section is substantially surrounded by a fabric comprising at least one layer of a conductive material. The energetic initiator section also has a back panel between the sections having at least one layer of blast resistant and fragmentation inhibiting material.","In a preferred embodiment of the invention, an initiator containment panel is removably attached to the back panel. This initiator containment panel comprises at least one layer of blast resistant and fragmentation resistant material. A second fabric comprising at least one layer of blast resistant and fragmentation inhibiting material is attached to the initiator containment panel forming a plurality of initiator holder pockets. The plurality of initiator holder pockets are placed having one end adjacent to outer edges of the pack. A third fabric, placed adjacent to the outer edges of the pack so it substantially covers the outer bottoms of the plurality of initiator holder pockets also comprises at least one layer of blast resistant and fragmentation inhibiting material.","The invention, as embodied herein, comprises a back worn pack that allows a user to transport both energetic materials, such as primary explosives, and energetic initiators, such as blasting caps, within the pack without the threat of premature initiation of the energetic materials.","In general, the invention is a pack with two main sections. The first section is designed to carry energetic materials and associated devices, tools, etc. This energetic material section is made of normal, sturdy, backpack material such as a nylon material. The second section is designed to carry energetic initiators. This energetic initiator section is constructed of materials and configured in such a way to avoid premature activation of one or more of the initiators. The energetic initiator section is also designed so that premature activation of one or more of the energetic initiators does not initiate the energetic materials stored within the energetic material section. These two missions are accomplished by using a combination of materials to construct the energetic initiator section that include at least one layer of a conductive material that surrounds the energetic initiator section and at least one layer of blast resistant and fragmentation inhibiting material between the energetic initiator section and the energetic material section of the pack. More preferably, multiple layers of blast resistant and fragmentation inhibiting material will be interspersed between regular pack material, such as nylon, as well as one or more layers of polycarbonate material which hardens when impacted by a projectile, placed between the two pack sections.","Referring to , the invention comprises a back worn pack  made up of an energetic materials section  attached to an energetic initiator section . Each of these sections has closure means  that may be opened and closed to provide openings  whereby one may place items into the sections , . The energetic initiator section  is surrounded by a fabric  that comprises at least one layer of a conductive material. The fabric  on a back panel , between the energetic materials section  and the energetic initiator section  also comprises at least one layer of blast resistant and fragmentation inhibiting material.","In a preferred embodiment of the invention, a cap containment panel  is removeably attached to the back panel . The cap containment panel  comprises at least one layer of blast resistant and fragmentation inhibiting material. A second fabric  is attached to the cap containment panel  to form a plurality of initiator holder pockets  wherein single energetic initiators are placed. The second fabric  also comprises at least one layer of blast resistant and fragmentation inhibiting material. The plurality of initiator holder pockets  will preferably be arranged so that a bottom  of the pockets  is substantially adjacent to an outer edge  of the pack  so that an initiator placed within a pocket  will not fall through the bottom . Along the inside of the outer edge  adjacent to the bottoms  of the pockets  and between the outer edge  and bottoms , a third fabric  also comprising at least one layer of blast resistant and fragmentation inhibiting material is attached.","The construction material of the outside of the pack  may be any normal pack  material, but is preferably nylon and most preferably 1000 dernier nylon. In a preferred embodiment of the invention, the fabric  surrounding the energetic initiator section  comprises a layer of conductive material sandwiched between two layers of the nylon pack material. When using the term conductive material, this refers to a material that can conduct electricity in such a manner to be resistant to electro-static discharge and electromagnetic interference that would cause initiators to prematurely activate. Examples of such a conductive materials include VELOSTAT\u00ae and MYLAR\u00ae.","The fabric  on the back panel , in order to provide greater protection between the energetic initiators and the energetic materials will preferably comprise two layers of blast resistant and fragmentation inhibiting material between the nylon along with the layer of conductive material. The blast resistant and fragmentation inhibiting material as used within this application are materials that prohibit products resulting from activation of an initiator from reaching energetic materials in the other section of the pack . Examples of such materials include KEVLAR\u00ae, SPECTRA\u00ae, and VECTRAN\u00ae. Preferably 1500 dernier KEVLAR\u00ae layers will be employed in the invention.","The cap containment panel  may be attached or removed from the back panel  for easy loading and unloading of initiators. One preferred attachment mechanism are hook and loop materials such as VELCRO\u00ae, but any method known in the art may be employed. The cap containment panel  will preferably be constructed of numerous layers of blast resistant and fragmentation inhibiting material interspersed with at least one layer of polycarbonate material which hardens when impacted by a projectile, along with the pack  material. Polycarbonate materials which harden when impacted by projectiles are commonly referred to as \u201cbullet-proof\u201d materials and are known as such in the art. One example of such a material is LEXAN\u00ae. It is preferred to employ \u215b inch thick layers of LEXAN\u00ae in the invention. In a most preferred embodiment, the cap containment panel  will comprise two layers of a polycarbonate material which hardens when impacted by a projectile surrounded by four layers of blast resistant and fragmentation inhibiting material surrounded by two layers of nylon.","The second fabric  is attached to the cap containment panel  to configure the plurality of initiator holder pockets  as noted above in order to place individual initiators within the pockets . In a preferred embodiment of the invention, a plurality of removable holder pocket tops  are removeably attached to the plurality of pockets  wherein the tops  keep the initiators within the pockets  until the initiator tops  are removed. The tops  may be constructed of the pack  material. The pockets  may be configured to hold numerous energetic initiators. When configured to hold blasting caps, it is preferable that the pockets  be tube shaped and located with the bottom  along an outer edge  of the pack . The blasting cap tip would be placed adjacent the bottom , so the additional protection from the third fabric , as described in greater detail below, may be concentrated at this location. Referring to , the initiator holder pockets preferably comprise two concentric plastic tubes  having an air gap  therebetween. In a most preferred embodiment of the invention, the pockets  further comprise two layers of a nylon material  having two layers of the blast resistant and fragmentation inhibiting material  therebetween and surrounding the outer plastic tube . Again, this configuration provides additional protection directly around the initiators.","Again referring to , because the third fabric  is placed between the bottom  of the pockets  and an outer edge  of the pack , and because this is normally the location of the \u201chot\u201d end of an initiator, extra material layers are preferred. The third fabric  preferably comprises at least one layer of polycarbonate material which hardens when impacted by a projectile along with the at least one layer of blast resistant and fragmentation resistant material. Preferably, the third fabric  comprises multiple layers of each material along with the pack  material to provide more protection around the initiators. In a most preferred embodiment, the third fabric  comprises a layer of blast resistant and fragmentation inhibiting material surrounded by two layers of polycarbonate material which hardens when impacted by a projectile surrounded by four layers of blast resistant and fragmentation inhibiting material surrounded by two layers of nylon.","The size of the pack  is dependent upon the users needs and may be selected by one skilled in the art. The pack  may also be configured with numerous pockets or pouches within both sections , , either fixed or removable, dependent upon user needs. For removable pouches or pockets, various fasteners, known in the art, such as hook and loop or molle fasteners may be employed. For use by explosive ordnance disposal technicians, it is preferred to include pouches for disposal tools, portable computers, portable GPS system, water containers, and other ordnance disposal needs.","Referring to , the pack  is parachute jump certified. Attachment points  allow the pack  to be configured top up or inverted during a parachute jump. The pack  also has belt harness  to accompany the adjustable shoulder straps  to fully secure the pack  to the users back.","The invention also includes a safe method of transporting primary explosives and initiators that includes employing a pack as described herein and placing primary explosives within the energetic materials section and placing the initiators within the energetic initiator section. The particular configuration and materials of the pack, as described above, prevent initiation of the primary explosives via premature activation of one or more initiators.","What is described are specific examples of many possible variations on the same invention and are not intended in a limiting sense. The claimed invention can be practiced using other variations not specifically described above."],"brief-description-of-drawings":[{},{}],"description-of-drawings":{"heading":"BRIEF DESCRIPTION OF THE DRAWINGS","p":["The accompanying drawings, which are incorporated in and constitute a part of the specification, illustrate embodiments of the invention, and, together with the description, serve to explain the principles of the invention.",{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0016","num":"0015"},"figref":"FIG. 1"},{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0017","num":"0016"},"figref":["FIG. 2","FIG. 1"]},{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0018","num":"0017"},"figref":["FIG. 3","FIG. 1"]},{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0019","num":"0018"},"figref":["FIG. 4","FIG. 1"]},{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0020","num":"0019"},"figref":"FIG. 5"}]},"DETDESC":[{},{}]}
