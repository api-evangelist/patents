title: Fluorapatite-forming calcium phosphate cements
abstract: This study reports in vitro and in vivo properties of fluorapatite (FA)-forming calcium phosphate cements (CPCs). Experimental cements contained from (0 to 3.1) mass % of F, corresponding to presence of FA at levels of approximately (0 to 87) mass %. The crystallinity of the apatitic cement product increased greatly with the FA content. When implanted subcutaneously in rats, the in vivo resorption rate decreased significantly with increasing FA content. The cement with the highest FA content was not resorbed in soft tissue, making it biocompatible and bioinert CPC. These bioinert CPCs are candidates for use in useful applications where slow or no resorption of the implant is required to achieve the desired clinical outcome.

Nos. 61\/361,113 filed Jul. 2, 2010 entitled In Vitro and in Vivo Characteristics of Fluorapatite-Forming Calcium Phosphate Cements and 61\/448,485 filed Mar. 2, 2011 entitled In Vitro and in Vivo Characteristics of Fluorapatite-Forming Calcium Phosphate Cements for which priority is claimed.","This investigation was supported, in part, by Grant DE 11789 to the American Dental Association Foundation from the National Institute of Dental and Craniofacial Research, and was conducted by Paffenbarger Research Center at the National Institute of Standards and Technology. The animal study was supported, in part, by Grant DE 11789 to the Nihon University School of Dentistry and was conducted at Nihon University School of Dentistry, Nihon, Japan.","In a principal aspect, the present invention relates to calcium phosphate cements, their preparation, composition and physicochemical properties particularly as enhanced by fluoride materials.","Calcium phosphate cements (CPCs) have been the subject of considerable interest in the field of bone graft biomaterials. Such materials have been found to be biocompatible and osteoconductive. This leaves CPCs bio-resorption characteristics as one of the remaining important properties to be more fully understood and controlled in order to achieve optimum CPC-to-bone conversion.","CPCs of different compositions can form different end products such as hydroxyapatite (HA), octacalcium phosphate, and dicalcium phosphate dihydrate (DCPD), also known as brushite. An in vivo property of HA-forming CPCs is that the HA formed does not dissolve spontaneously in a normal physiological fluid environment, yet is resorbable under cell-mediated acidic conditions. Although DCPD is soluble in normal physiological fluids, studies have shown that resorption of DCPD-forming CPC is also essentially cell-mediated, mainly due to conversion of the DCPD to an apatitic phase in situ.","In this regard, studies on fluoride (F)-substituted hydroxyapatite (HA)-based biomaterials show that F can play useful roles in calcium phosphate-based bone grafts. F-substitute HA has been shown to promote bone formation in rat tibia [Inoue et al, 2005; Inoue 2010] and dog mandible [Sakae et al., 2003]. Studies using human osteoblast-like cells show that a low level F-substitution HA enhanced osteocalcin expression [Grzanna et al., 2003], and fluorapatite (FA)-collagen composites exhibited higher cell proliferation and differentiation [Yoon et al., 2005] compared to the F-free counterpart. A study in the patent literature [Yuan et al., 2010] claims that NaF-loaded tricalcium phosphate (TCP) ceramic exhibited osteoinductivity in a goat model. These findings suggest that fluoride may play a role in bone formation and therefore F-releasing bone graft materials may provide an added advantage.

However, no attempts are understood to have been made to understand the amounts and forms of F that can be incorporated into the CPC product. Neither is there understood to be information on the properties of any F-containing CPCs. Chow L C, Takagi S (1996). Self-setting calcium phosphate cements and methods for preparing and using them.

No. 7,351,280, April 1.","Nonetheless such information is believed to be relevant since CPCs with different resorption rates may be especially suitable for different clinical applications. That is, for some clinical applications, specifically endodontic applications, such as root end fill, perforation repair, etc., it is desirable to have CPCs that are biocompatible and osteoconductive, yet non-bioresorbable in soft and hard tissues. Since in vivo resorption is a result of dissolution in a cell-mediated acidic environment, CPCs that form products that have little or practically no solubility in such acidic conditions can be expected to be essentially non-resorbable.","For example, literature suggests that fully or partially fluoridated HA materials have significantly lower solubility in acids. Thus, fluorapatite (FA)-forming CPCs can be expected to have much lower resorbability than HA-forming CPCs. As a consequence, development of FA-forming CPCs and their physicochemical properties as well as in vivo resorption characteristics are reasonable objectives in order to facilitate their utility. As a consequence, methods for preparation of fluoride containing CPC's and their associated physicochemical properties will enable useful therapeutic options, for example, with respect to clinical endodontic applications.","Briefly the present invention comprises compositions of fluoride containing CPCs as well as the associated properties of the various compositions and techniques for making such compositions. More specifically, the invention comprises techniques to prepare F-containing CPC materials with controllable amounts of the following desirable minor components and structure:\n\n","The techniques enable design and manufacture of F-CPC compositions having a prescribed range of in vivo resorption rates and osteoconductivity.","An aspect of the invention is discovery of F-containing CPC-materials with adequate setting time and physical and biological properties suitable for use in bone defect repair and endodontic applications that can be produced by mixing a powder mixture and a liquid. The powder mixture consists of DCPA and\/or DCPD and at least one compound that has a Ca\/P molar ratio of 1.5 or higher. Examples are \u03b1-TCP, \u03b2-TCP, ACP, TTCP, CaO, CaCO. The source of F can be present in either the powder mixture or cement liquid or both. A fluoride (F) compound with adequate solubility to dissolve readily and participate in the cement setting reactions can be used. Examples are NaF, KF, and HF. The cement liquid can be a phosphate-containing solution with phosphate concentration from 0.1 to 3 mol\/L and pH from 0.1 to 12. Other solutions that have been previously used for calcium phosphate cements may also be used. A F source can be dissolved into the solution when desired or incorporated in the powder mixture.","As a further aspect of the invention, particle size of the DCPA (DCPD) and the other Ca-containing compounds are effective in controlling the properties (1) to (3) mentioned above. Specifically particle sizes of powder constituents typically are in the range of 1 to 20 microns.","As another aspect of the invention, use of CaCOrather than a CaO as the other Ca-containing compound leads to carbonate incorporation, increased F-HA content, and higher crystallinity.","As another aspect of the invention, the pH of the cement paste during setting, may be principally controlled by the pH of the cement liquid to promote F-HA formation.","These and other objects, aspects and features are set forth in the description which follows.","The cement material of the invention comprises a mixture of a powder which includes DCPA, DCPD or a combination thereof along with a calcium phosphate in powder form selected from a group of such materials alone or in combination: e.g. TCP, BTCP, ACP, TTCP and optionally, CaO and CaCO. The powder is mixed with a solution to form a paste. The solution typically contains selected, dissolved fluoride compounds. A series of studies exemplifies the compositions, their properties and their utility as biosorable or non-biosorable as well as an appropriate crystalline and\/or chemical form or structure.","When a soluble F, e.g., NaF, is added to either the solid or solution phase of the CPC ingredients, F will be present in the hardened CPC material in three possible forms: (1) F incorporated into the structure of the apatitic CPC product, forming either FA or F-substituted HA, (2) F present in the form of calcium fluoride (CaF) or phosphate-contaminated CaFwhich is known as \u201cCaF-like\u201d material, and (3) F that is essentially unreacted or loosely absorbed on the CPC product and therefore present in a highly labile form.","The carbonate content and crystallinity of the apatite products formed in these F-containing CPC materials are also controllable. These factors affect resorption and osteoconductive properties of the CPC materials.","Because FA and F-substituted HA are considerably less soluble than HA under acidic physiological-like environment, the F-containing materials can be expected to be less resorbable than HA in vivo. Resorbability of CPC materials implanted subcutaneously in rats decreased significantly with increasing FA content. Therefore F-substitution can be an additional means for controlling resorption rate. In contrast to FA and F-substituted HA, the F present in the form of CaFis expected to be slowly released into the surrounding tissues under normal physiological conditions, which may affect osteoconductivity of the CPC bone graft. Thus, the disclosed F-containing CPC materials with different forms of F incorporation, apatite crystallinity and carbonate content can provide significant additional control of osteoconductivity and resorption rate that are of importance to clinical applications as discussed herein.","Following are the results of multiple studies in vitro and in vivo with respect to materials compositions and processing protocols.","Study 1 and Study 2\u2014In Vitro and In Vivo Study of FA-CPCs",{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0038","num":"0040"},"tables":{"@attributes":{"id":"TABLE-US-00001","num":"00001"},"table":{"@attributes":{"frame":"none","colsep":"0","rowsep":"0"},"tgroup":[{"@attributes":{"align":"left","colsep":"0","rowsep":"0","cols":"1"},"colspec":{"@attributes":{"colname":"1","colwidth":"217pt","align":"center"}},"thead":{"row":[{"entry":"TABLE 1"},{"entry":{"@attributes":{"namest":"1","nameend":"1","align":"center","rowsep":"1"}}},{"entry":"Acronyms used in Study 1 and Study 2"},{"entry":{"@attributes":{"namest":"1","nameend":"1","align":"center","rowsep":"1"}}}]},"tbody":{"@attributes":{"valign":"top"},"row":{"entry":{}}}},{"@attributes":{"align":"left","colsep":"0","rowsep":"0","cols":"3"},"colspec":[{"@attributes":{"colname":"1","colwidth":"35pt","align":"left"}},{"@attributes":{"colname":"2","colwidth":"126pt","align":"left"}},{"@attributes":{"colname":"3","colwidth":"56pt","align":"left"}}],"tbody":{"@attributes":{"valign":"top"},"row":[{"entry":[{},"Calcium Phosphate Cement","CPC"]},{"entry":[{},"Dicalcium phosphate anhydrous","DCPA"]},{"entry":[{},"Dicalcium phosphate dihydrate","DCPD"]},{"entry":[{},"Fluorapatite","FA"]},{"entry":[{},"Fibrous connective tissue","FCT"]},{"entry":[{},"Giant cell","GC"]},{"entry":[{},"Granulation Tissue","GT"]},{"entry":[{},"Hydroxyapatite","HA"]},{"entry":[{},"Infiltrated cell","IC"]},{"entry":[{},"Implanted Material","IM"]},{"entry":[{},"Tetracalcium phosphate","TTCP"]},{"entry":[{},"Uncalcified material","UM"]},{"entry":{"@attributes":{"namest":"1","nameend":"3","align":"center","rowsep":"1"}}}]}}]}}},"Study 1\u2014Characterization of Composition","CPC powder used in the study was a CPC consisting of equimolar amounts of tetracalcium phosphate (TTCP), Ca(PO)O and dicalcium phosphate anhydrous (DCPA). CaHPO. TTCP was prepared by heating an equimolar mixture of commercially obtained DCPA (Baker Analytical Reagents, J.T. Baker Chemical Co., Phillipsburg, N.J.) and CaCO(J.T. Baker Chemical Co.) at 1500\u00b0 C. for 6 h in a furnace and quenched at room temperature. All chemicals were reagent grade and used as received. The TTCP and DCPA powders were ground individually in a planetary ball mill (PM4, Brinkman, N.Y.). The TTCP was ground dry and DCPA was ground in 95% ethanol for 24 h to obtain the desired median particle sizes. The particle sizes of TTCP and DCPA were measured using a centrifugal particle size analyzer (SA-CP3, Shimadzu, Kyoto, Japan) with an estimated standard uncertainty of 0.2 \u03bcm. The median particle sizes of TTCP and DCPA used in this study were 17 \u03bcm and 1 \u03bcm, respectively.","Cement liquid was a 2 mol\/L HPOsolution containing either 1 mol\/L (L1), 4 mol\/L (L2) or 8 mol\/L (L3) hydrogen fluoride (HF) (B&A, Industrial Chemical Division, Morristown, N.J.).","Three experimental FA-forming CPCs, (FA-CPC1, FA-CPC2 and FA-CPC3) were prepared by mixing the CPC powder with the L1, L2 or L3 liquid at a powder to-liquid ratio (P\/L) of 2. At this P\/L ratio, the amount of F supplied by the cement liquid would account for approximately (0.5, 2, and 4) mass % of the total solid mass, compared to the theoretical F content of pure FA of 3.8 mass %. Control CPC(CPC0) was prepared by mixing the CPC powder with the 2 mol\/L HPOsolution without HF at P\/L=2.","The three experimental FA-forming CPCs, (FA-CPC1, FA-CPC2 and FA-CPC3) and the control CPC, (CPC0), were prepared by mixing the respective powder and liquid on a Teflon slab for 20 s. After mixing the pastes were placed in stainless steel molds (6 mm D, 3 mm H) for 1 h. Hardened FA-CPCs were removed from molds and immersed for 23 h in a physiological-like solution (PLS) containing 1.15 mmol\/L Ca, 1.2 mmol\/L P, 133 mmol\/L NaCl, 50 mmol\/L HEPES, and pH adjusted to 7.4. The fluoride (F), calcium (Ca), and phosphate (P) contents of the 24 h FA-CPCs were determined by dissolving the sample in 0.5 mol\/L HC1Oand the acid solution was analyzed for F using a specific ion electrode, and Ca and P using spectrophotometric methods. The phases present in the 24 h FA-CPCs were characterized by powder x-ray diffraction (XRD). The XRD patterns were recorded (Rigaku DMAX 2200, Danvers, Mass., U.S.A.) using graphite-monochromatized CuK\u03b1 radiation (\u03bb=0.154 nm) generated at 40 kV and 40 mA. The specimen was scanned from (20\u00b0 to 40\u00b0) 2\u03b8 in a continuous mode (2\u00b0 2\u03b8 min, time constant 2 s). The surface morphology was observed using scanning electron microscopy (SEM) (JEOL JSM-5300, JOEL U.S.A., Inc., Peabody, Mass.) under the condition of 15 kV and 58 mA.","In this study, the standard deviation is considered as the standard uncertainty for all experimentally measured values.","In a separate experiment, fully cured FA-CPC3 (formulation with the highest F content) samples were analyzed using the KOH extraction method of Caslayska [Caslayska et al.

The presence of the latter can be attributed by the use of the highly acidic and phosphate-rich cement liquid (2 mol\/L HPO), which preferentially consumed TTCP, leaving some DCPA unreacted. The powder XRD pattern of FA-CPC1 is similar to that of CPC0, but with somewhat better crystalline HA and less unreacted DCPA. In contrast, FA-CPC2 and FA-CPC3 showed highly crystalline apatitic materials as the only phase present. The XRD patterns show that the crystallinity increased with increasing HF concentration of the cement liquid.","After 23 h incubation in PLS, both the FA-CPCs and control CPC samples were covered with plate and rod-shaped crystals (and ). Fractured surfaces of the control CPC0 showed small and less well-formed crystals, while FA-CPC3 showed mostly larger rod-like crystals. The F contents of the four CPC materials (Table 1) were (0, 0.4, 1.8 and 3.1) mass %. These correspond to the presence of FA in the cement products at levels of approximately (0, 10, 50, and 87) mass %. Results from the present study indicate that the F effects on crystallinity started to become highly pronounced somewhere between FA-CPC1 (10% FA) and FA-CPC2 (50% FA).","Discussion\u2014Study 1","An equimolar mixture of TTCP and DCPA was used as the solid component of all of the CPC materials. The control CPC(CPC0), prepared by mixing the TTCP+DCPA powder with a F-free 2 mol\/L HPOsolution, formed a poorly crystalline apatitic product together with some unreacted DCPA (). The presence of unreacted DCPA in the present study was probably due to the high acidity of the cement liquid (2 mol\/L HPO), leading to exhaustion of TTCP, the more alkaline component in the cement powder, before all DCPA could be reacted.","Inclusion of HF in the cement liquid produced two significant effects on the cement products. Firstly, the amount of unreacted DCPA decreased with increasing HF concentration. No unreacted DCPA was found in FA-CPC2 and FA-CPC3 (and ). Secondly, the crystallinity of the apatitic product increased greatly with increasing HF concentration. The powder XRD patterns () showed that both FA-CPC2 and FA-CPC3 are highly crystalline apatitic materials, whereas CPC0 was a poorly crystalline apatite.","The present study demonstrates that CPCs may form FA as a significant phase in the product. In this study, HF was used as the F source to minimize the number of components in the cement system. However, this leads to high acidity of the cement paste during setting. NaF can also be used as a source of F. Further, FA-forming CPCs can be formulated from several different calcium phosphates powder mixtures that would have acidic, neutral, or alkaline properties during and after setting. The FA-CPCs may find clinical applications where slow or no in vivo resorption is desired.","Study 2\u2014In Vivo Resorption Study Using a Rat Model","Animal experiments were conducted, with approval of the Animal Experimentation Committee at Nihon University School of Dentistry, in the animal and cell culture laboratories at Nihon University School of Dentistry. The study fully complied with the \u201cGuidelines for Animal Experimentation Committee at Nihon University School of Dentistry\u201d and with the NIH's \u201cStandards for Humane Care and Use of Laboratory Animals by Foreign Institutions.\u201d Experimental protocols are shown in . Each experimental FA-CPC material was tested in five adult Donryu rats with an average body weight of 200 g to 250 g. All experimental procedures on given animals were completed under aseptic conditions. Each animal was anesthetized with a pentobarbital sodium injection at a dose of 1.5 mg\/kg body weight. Under the general anesthesia, the back area of the rat was shaved and swabbed with 70% volume fraction ethanol. Four subcutaneous pockets were created, two on each side of the backbone, to implant the experimental CPCs. Four horizontal incisions approximately 15 mm in length were made along each side of the back bone, and subcutaneous skin pockets were created by blunt dissection (). The pockets were separated by 40 mm to 50 mm. Each cylindrical shaped sample (3 mm diameter and 6 mm length) was inserted into a pocket of subcutaneous tissues as shown in , and then the pocket was closed with interrupted sutures. Four weeks after surgery, the animals were sacrificed and the tissues including the test materials were excised en block.","Tissues were fixed in 10% neutralized-buffered formalin, decalcified with 10% formic acid for 14 d and embedded in paraffin. This decalcification period for the sample was longer than those of normal conditions. Subsequently, paraffin embedded blocks of decalcified specimens were cut into 3 \u03bcml to 4 \u03bcm cross-sections, and stained with hematoxylin and eosin.","Histopathological features of each specimen were observed using an optical microscope.","Results: Study 2","All FA-CPC implants, but not the control CPC0, retained the original cylindrical shape and were encapsulated by thin fibrous connective tissues (FCT) with small numbers of infiltrated cells (IC) (). Significant differences in tissue response to the four types of implants were noted as described below.","Study 2: CPC0 Samples ()","Significant resorption of CPCO had occurred, and the implanted material (1M) was well separated into small domains which were covered by FCT. The remaining 1M was completely decalcified by the 14-d decalcification period in 10% formic acid conducted in the specimen preparation process. Small numbers of macrophage and foreign body giant cells (GC) were found adjacent to the material. Granulation tissues (GT) were also formed in the implant area. The tissue reaction of the material was mild.","Study 2: FA-CPC1 Samples ()","FA-CPC1 resorbed considerably less than CPCO, but FCT was clearly formed throughout the implant area. Although the histopathological reactions of the surrounding tissues to FA-CPC1 were basically similar to the reaction to other FA-containing CPCs, inflammatory reaction was relatively few or negligible. The FCT surrounding the FA-CPC1 was very thin in comparison to the FCT formed over other experimental materials. Most of the 1M was decalcified, but small areas of the undecalcified material (UM) can be seen. The tissue reaction was extremely mild.","Study 2: FA-CPC2 Samples ()","The implanted FA-CPC2, which consisted of approximately 50% FA, was surrounded by relatively thin and dense FCT. Slight resorption of the implanted material had occurred, resulting in FCT formation in highly confined spaces within some areas of the 1M. Less amount of FCT was formed compared to that observed in the FA-CPC1 group. Very few inflammatory cells were found adjacent to the material. Some UM was seen in the implant area. The tissue reaction of the material was very mild.","Study 2: FA-CPC3 Samples ()","The implanted FA-CPC3, which has the composition of nearly pure FA, was not resorbed. The filling area was surrounded by relatively thick and dense FCT with small numbers of inflammatory cells. No FCT or other tissues were found within the implanted material. The implanted material remained completely un-dissolved by the decalcification step in the sample preparation, most likely due to the low acid solubility of FA. The tissue reaction of the material was gentle.","In general, all of the experimental FA-CPCs demonstrated good biocompatibility and shape-integrity when implanted in subcutaneous tissues","Discussion: Study 2","Because of the high acidity and high initial HF concentration in the cement liquid, one may expect that implantation of the experimental FA-CPC pastes in subcutaneous tissues, would incite negative tissue reactions. The results obtained from the study showed that the histopathological reactions of FA-CPCs were nearly identical and similar to the CPC0 that did not contain HF. In all cases, the implanted CPC material was surrounded by FCT with either negligible or small numbers of inflammatory cells. All of the materials used in this study showed high biocompatibility.","Histopathological examination results showed a clear trend of in vivo resorption for the four experimental CPCs as follows. On the one end, the F-free CPC0 showed significant resorption, and the implanted material was well separated into small domains that were covered by FCT. On the other end, the implanted FA-CPC3, which had the composition of nearly pure FA, was not resorbed. No FCT or other tissues were found within the implanted material. The in vivo properties of the other 2 FA-CPCs fell in between the two extremes. The lack of resorption of FA-CPC3 is likely to be the result of its insolubility in the acidic environment produced by inflammatory or other giant cells.","This material thus comprises a calcium phosphate cement that is chemo-mechanically stable in soft tissues, making it a biocompatible and bioinert material. These bioinert CPCs may be used for applications where slow or no resorption of the implant is required to achieve desired clinical outcome.","Summary\u2014Study 1 and 2: Fluorapatite Calcium Phosphate Cements","Materials and Methods: Various amounts of NaF powder were added to a conventional CPC powder consisting of equimolar amounts of tetracalcium phosphate (median size 17 \u03bcm) and dicalcium phosphate anhydrous (1.2 \u03bcm) to obtain F\/Ca ratios of 0, 0.05, 0.10, 0.20 (stoichiometric ratio for FA) and 0.40. Samples for setting time (Gilmore needle method) and diametral tensile strength (DTS) measurements were prepared by mixing the cement powder with 0.5M phosphate (pH 5.6) solution at P\/L=2.5.

The porosities were (35.5\u00b11.8, 36.6\u00b12.0, 38.0\u00b11.5, 42.4\u00b11.0, and 49.7\u00b10.9) vol %, respectively. Total F contents were (0, 0.71\u00b10.02, 1.28\u00b10.04, 1.97\u00b10.04, and 3.82\u00b10.10) mass %, respectively.","Conclusions: FA can be formed as a product of CPC. ANOVA of the results showed significant (p<0.05) differences among the groups. The amounts of F incorporated into the CPC product increased with F\/Ca ratio in the cement powder. F incorporation led to decreases in the setting time (except F\/Ca ration of 0.4) and DTS, but increases in the porosity (except F\/Ca ratio of 0.05 and 0.10) and crystallinity of the apatitic product. The material has a neutral pH rather than acidic pH, which is the case with the HF-containing CPCs described heretofore.","Summary\u2014Study 1 and Study 2: Properties of DCPA+CaO and DCPA+CaCOFluorapatite-Forming Calcium Phosphate Cements","Presence of low levels of fluoride (F) in calcium phosphate bone grafts was shown to be desirable in promoting bone formation.","Materials and Methods: The cement powder consisted of 1 mole of NaF, 3 moles of either small (SDCPA, 2.1 \u03bcm medium size) or large (LDCPA, 10.8 \u03bcm) DCPA particles, and 2 moles of either CaO (4.5 \u03bcm) or CaCO(2.6 \u03bcm). Samples for setting time (Gilmore needle method) and diametral tensile strength (DTS) measurements were prepared by mixing the cement powder with 0.5M phosphate solution (pH=5.6) at P\/L=2.5. The apatitic F and CaFcontents were determined using previously described methods.","Results: The setting times (mean\u00b1standard deviation; n=4) of the SDCPA-CaO, LDCPA-CaO, SDCPA-CaCOand LDCPA-CaCOcements were: (9.5\u00b11.0, 19.3\u00b11.5, 14.5\u00b11.0, and 56.3\u00b14.8) min, respectively. The DTS were (1.5\u00b10.3, 1.2\u00b10.2, 1.7\u00b10.4, and 4.0\u00b10.4) MPa, respectively.

The CaFcontents were (2.2\u00b10.2, 1.6\u00b10.1, 0.42\u00b10.18, and 0.25\u00b10.02) mass %, respectively.","Conclusions: FA can be formed as a product of all the CPC compositions studied. Two-way ANOVA of the results show that both independent variables (DCPA size and CaO or CaCO) have significant (p<0.05) effects on all 4 measured variables. Compared to CaO, CaCO-containing compositions produced cements with high amount of FA with little CaF, high DTS, and higher crystallinity, but longer setting time.","Study 3 and Study 4: Quantative Characterization of Fluoride Present in Fluorapatite\u2014Forming Calcium Phosphate Cements","Fluoride substituted hydroxyapatite (F-HA)\u2014F is known to substitute for the hydroxyl group in the apatite crystal structure. Thus, F-substituted HA may have the general formula of\n\nCa(PO)F(OH)\u2003\u2003(1)\n","where 0\u2266x\u22662, and the formula represents pure HA when x=0, and pure FA when x=2.","Carbonate substituted hydroxyapatite (C-HA)\u2014For reactions taken place at ambient temperatures, carbonate is known to substitute for the phosphate group of HA. This is known as the type-B carbonate incorporation. A general formula for carbonate-substituted HA is\n\nCa(PO)(CO)(OH)\u2003\u2003(2)\n","Alternatively, since sodium is readily incorporated into the apatite structure by replacing a Ca ion, carbonated apatite may be described by the following formula when formed in the presence of sodium ions:\n\nCaNa(PO)(CO)(OH)\u2003\u2003(3)\n","Calcium-deficient hydroxyapatite (Ca-d HA)\u2014Even in the pure 3-component system [Ca(OH)\u2014HPO\u2014HO] where neither F nor carbonate was present, Ca-deficient HA instead of pure HA is the more likely phase to form. The Ca-deficient HA may be described by the formula,\n\nCaH(PO)(OH)\u2003\u2003(4)\n","Ca-deficient, fluoride and carbonate-substituted HA\u2014The apatitic phase present in the F-containing CPCs described is likely to be a combination of all three of the above identified apatite phases and can be described by the formula,\n\nCaH(PO)(CO)F(OH)\u2003\u2003(5)\n","Since F substitution is the key property to be described for simplicity the term \u201cF-HA\u201d, defined earlier (Eq. 1) as F-substituted HA, will be used to represent the Ca-deficient, carbonate-containing, and F-substituted HA with or without Na incorporation.","Phosphate contaminated calcium fluoride (CaF)\u2014When CaF2 is precipitated in the presence of phosphate, phosphate is known to be incorporated into the precipitate as an impurity. This phase is known as a CaF-like material, which has a greater thermodynamic solubility than that of the pure CaF.","Experimental Protocol and Results","Materials and Methods: Various amounts of NaF was added to a CPC powder consisting of equimolar amounts of Ca(PO)O and CaHPOto obtain F\/Ca molar ratios of 0.05, 0.10, 0.20, and 0.40. CPC specimens (6 mm dia\u00d73 mm height) were prepared by mixing the powder with a 0.5 mol\/L phosphate (pH5.6) solution at P\/L=2.5. Three types of F present in the set specimen were determined by sequential extractions: (1) Unreacted F was determined from the amount of F extractable by a pH 7.4 physiological-like solution, (2) F in the form of CaFwas determined from F extractable by 1M KOH solution, and (3) Apatitic F was the F remained in the specimen after the extractions.","Results: The FA content (mean\u00b1standard deviation; n=4) of the specimens prepared from CPC powders with F\/Ca ratios of 0.05, 0.10, 0.20 and 0.40 were (18.5\u00b11.3, 31.2\u00b11.9, 34.4\u00b11.7, and 31.0\u00b12.0) mass %, respectively. The CaFcontents were (0.02\u00b10, 0.2\u00b10.02, 1.38\u00b10.13, and 5.43\u00b10.37) mass %, respectively. The unreacted F accounted for (0.41\u00b10.03, 6.9\u00b10.7, 29.8\u00b11.6, and 38.7\u00b10.7) mass %, respectively, of the F initially present in the cement powder.","Conclusions: Both FA and CaFwere formed in CPCs that initially contained NaF in the cement powder as the source of F. ANOVA of the results showed significant (p<0.05) differences among the groups. Higher F\/Ca ratio led to increases in the amounts of unreacted F, CaF, and FA, but the FA content reached a plateau at F\/Ca=0.20. Because the two compounds have quite different solubilities, CaFcan slowly release F into the surrounding physiological fluids while FAp cannot except under highly acidic pH conditions.","The results obtained from the present studies also demonstrate that FA-CPCs are highly biocompatible with subcutaneous tissues. The resorption rate of FA-CPCs appears to decrease with increasing FA content, and suggests that the FA-CPC3, which has a composition of nearly pure FA, is non-resorbable in vivo.","Following are composition and material processing studies","Study 3\u2014Properties of (DCPA+CaO+NaF) and (DCPA+CaCO+NaF) Fluorapatite-Forming Calcium Phosphate Cements","Materials:","Commercially obtained dicalcium phosphate anhydrous (DCPA, Baker Analytical Reagents, J.T.

After removed from the incubation described in step (1) above, the CPC specimen was thoroughly dried and finely ground. About 100 mg of the ground powder was suspended in a 100 mL of 1M KOH solution under vigorous stirring for 24 h.

The XRD () revealed that in the absence of F, the DCPAm-CaCOcement formed little HA product while the DCPAm-CaO cement formed some low crystalline HA. In the presence of F, the DCPAm-CaCOcement was nearly completely converted to high crystalline F-HA, while the DCPAm-CaO cement was nearly completely converted to low crystalline F-HA. The XRD results thus showed that the presence of F led to formation of significantly greater amounts of higher crystalline apatite products.

Thus, it is possible to control these parameters by adjusting the proportion of the CaO and CaCOpresent in the cement mixture. To show this, we prepared cements with CaO:CaCOmolar ratios of 0:2, 1:1, 2:0. Indeed, both the F-HA crystallinity () and carbonate contents () of the cements can continuously varied in relation to the CaO:CaCOratio.","Study 4\u2014Properties of (DCPA+TTCP+NaF) Fluorapatite-Forming Calcium Phosphate Cements","Materials:","This study investigated the properties of F-containing CPC materials prepared from mixtures containing DCPA, TTCP and NaF. The various cement mixtures consisted of equal molar amounts of DCPAs (1.0 \u03bcm median size, Table 3) and either TTCPl (20.4 \u03bcm median size) or TTCPs (4.0 \u03bcm median size). The mixtures further contained various amounts of NaF to yield F\/Ca molar ratios of 0, 0.05, 0.1, 0.2, and 0.4. Since pure FA has a F\/Ca ratio of 0.2, the F contents in the mixtures ranged from 0 to about twice that of FA.","A 0.5 mol\/L sodium phosphate (pH 5.6) solution, prepared by diluting a commercially obtained phosphate solution (Sodium Phosphates Inj, USP, Abbott Labs, N. Chicago, Ill.), was used as the cement liquid in all cases.","Experimental Design:","The TTCP particle size (TTCPs or TTCPl) and the F\/Ca molar ratios (0, 0.05, 0.1, 0.2, and 0.4) of the cement mixtures were the two independent variables in this study. The measured or observed properties included cement setting time (ST) and the following properties of the set cement specimens: diametral tensile strength (DTS), porosity, F contents (in three different forms), carbonate contents, and crystallinity of the apatite phase.","Methods:","Methods used in this study were the same as the ones described in Study 3 above.","Results:","Setting time (ST), Diametral Tensile Strength (DTS), and Porosity","The mean ST, DTS and porosity of the four cements are shown in Table 7a. The ANOVA results are given in Table 7b. For all three measured parameters, ST, DTS, and porosity, both independent variables, i.e., F\/Ca molar ratio and the TTCP particle size, as well as their interactions produced significant (p<0.05) effects.","The cements prepared using the TTCPl-containing mixtures exhibited ST of 8 to 9 min for F\/Ca ratios of 0.05 to 0.2. The ST was longer when the F\/Ca ratio was either 0 or 0.4. The cements prepared with the mixtures containing TTCPs had ST from 14 to 17 min for F\/Ca ratio from 0.05 to 0.2. These values were generally longer than the corresponding cements made with TTCPl-containing mixtures.","The DTS of all F-containing cements were lower than the same cement that did not contain F (Table 7a). The DTS generally decreased with increasing F content.","The porosity of the cement appears to increase with increasing F content (Table 7a). In most cases, the cement made from the TTCPs-containing powder exhibited higher porosity than did the corresponding cement made from TTCPl-containing powder.","Amounts of F in Three Different Forms:","Mean values (mass %) of the three types of F present in the cements are shown in Table 8a, The ANOVA results (Table 8b) showed for all three types of measured F, both independent variables, i.e., F\/Ca molar ratio and TTCP size, as well as their interactions produced significant effects (p<0.05).","Unreacted F\u2014For all cements, the amount of unreacted F was 0 at low F\/Ca ratio and it increased continuously with increasing F\/Ca ratio, i.e., the amount of NaF added to the cement mixture. The cements prepared from the TTCPl-containing mixtures had a higher unreacted F content than the corresponding cements prepared from the TTCPs-containing mixtures.","F in the form of CaF\u2014For all cements, the amount of incorporated F in the form of CaFincreased with increasing F\/Ca ratio. The cements prepared with the TTCPl-containing mixtures showed a higher CaF-type F content than the corresponding cements prepared from the TTCPs-containing mixtures.","F incorporated into the apatitic structure\u2014For cements made from the TTCPs-containing mixtures, the apatitic F content increased with increasing F\/Ca ratio. In contrast, the cements prepared using the TTCPl-containing mixtures reached a plateau when the F\/Ca ratio was 0.1 and higher. At these higher F\/Ca ratios, the TTCPs-originated cements had a higher apatitic F content than the corresponding cements made from the TTCPl-containing mixtures.","Effects of F on Crystallinity and Amount of F-HA Formation:","The XRD patterns of the DCPAs-TTCPl cements with F\/Ca ratios from 0 to 0.4 are shown in . It can be seen that for these cements, the conversion of the initial cement mixture to apatite actually decreased with increasing F\/Ca ratio, i.e., the F content in the initial mixture. This surprising result can be explained by the formation of a firm F-HA coating on TTCP particle surfaces in the initial stage of the cement setting reaction. This coating limited the ability of the TTCP particles to dissolve and participate further in the setting reaction. This phenomenon becomes more prominent when a higher level off F was present. The crystallinity of the apatite phase in these cements seemed unchanged with increasing F presence.","The XRD patterns of the cements prepared from the TTCPs-containing mixtures () indicates that the crystallinity of the apatite phase improved slightly with increasing F content. However, extent of apatite formation also decreased slightly with increasing F content for the reason given above.",{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0164","num":"0166"},"tables":{"@attributes":{"id":"TABLE-US-00009","num":"00009"},"table":{"@attributes":{"frame":"none","colsep":"0","rowsep":"0","pgwide":"1"},"tgroup":{"@attributes":{"align":"left","colsep":"0","rowsep":"0","cols":"1"},"colspec":{"@attributes":{"colname":"1","colwidth":"280pt","align":"center"}},"thead":{"row":[{"entry":"TABLE 7a"},{"entry":{"@attributes":{"namest":"1","nameend":"1","align":"center","rowsep":"1"}}}]},"tbody":{"@attributes":{"valign":"top"},"row":[{"entry":"Mean ST (min), DTS (MPa) and porosity (vol %) of DCPAs-TTCPl and"},{"entry":"DCPAs-TTCPs cements (mean \u00b1 standard deviation)."},{"entry":{"chemistry":{"@attributes":{"id":"CHEM-US-00003","num":"00003"},"img":{"@attributes":{"id":"EMI-C00003","he":"26.33mm","wi":"94.74mm","file":"US08293004-20121023-C00003.TIF","alt":"embedded image","img-content":"table","img-format":"tif"}}}}},{"entry":{"@attributes":{"namest":"1","nameend":"1","align":"center","rowsep":"1"}}},{"entry":"Values connected by a horizontal line or vertical line are not significantly different."}]}}}}},{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0165","num":"0167"},"tables":{"@attributes":{"id":"TABLE-US-00010","num":"00010"},"table":{"@attributes":{"frame":"none","colsep":"0","rowsep":"0"},"tgroup":[{"@attributes":{"align":"left","colsep":"0","rowsep":"0","cols":"1"},"colspec":{"@attributes":{"colname":"1","colwidth":"217pt","align":"center"}},"thead":{"row":{"entry":"TABLE 7b"}},"tbody":{"@attributes":{"valign":"top"},"row":[{"entry":{"@attributes":{"namest":"1","nameend":"1","align":"center","rowsep":"1"}}},{"entry":"Two-way ANOVA results, main effect and "},{"entry":"interactions on ST, DTS, or porosity"}]}},{"@attributes":{"align":"left","colsep":"0","rowsep":"0","cols":"3"},"colspec":[{"@attributes":{"colname":"offset","colwidth":"35pt","align":"left"}},{"@attributes":{"colname":"1","colwidth":"56pt","align":"center"}},{"@attributes":{"colname":"2","colwidth":"126pt","align":"center"}}],"tbody":{"@attributes":{"valign":"top"},"row":[{"entry":[{},"Source","Significance, p value"]},{"entry":[{},{"@attributes":{"namest":"offset","nameend":"2","align":"center","rowsep":"1"}}]},{"entry":[{},"F\/Ca molar ratio","<0.001"]},{"entry":[{},"TTCP size","<0.001"]},{"entry":[{},"Interaction","<0.001"]},{"entry":[{},{"@attributes":{"namest":"offset","nameend":"2","align":"center","rowsep":"1"}}]}]}}]}}},{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0166","num":"0168"},"tables":{"@attributes":{"id":"TABLE-US-00011","num":"00011"},"table":{"@attributes":{"frame":"none","colsep":"0","rowsep":"0","pgwide":"1"},"tgroup":{"@attributes":{"align":"left","colsep":"0","rowsep":"0","cols":"1"},"colspec":{"@attributes":{"colname":"1","colwidth":"259pt","align":"center"}},"thead":{"row":[{"entry":"TABLE 8a"},{"entry":{"@attributes":{"namest":"1","nameend":"1","align":"center","rowsep":"1"}}}]},"tbody":{"@attributes":{"valign":"top"},"row":[{"entry":"Mean values (mass %) of unreacted, CaF2-like F, apatitically-bound F (mean \u00b1"},{"entry":"standard deviation;
