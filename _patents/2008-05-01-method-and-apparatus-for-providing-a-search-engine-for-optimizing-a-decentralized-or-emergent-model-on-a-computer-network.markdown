title: Method and apparatus for providing a search engine for optimizing a decentralized or emergent model on a computer network
abstract: A search engine is provided for searching, evaluating and/or optimizing an emergent model on a computer network. The emergent model is created by independently generating, publishing references to, and subscribing to data objects and/or function objects in a manner free of a globally predefined data object and/or function object definition. Messages are sent to referencing data objects and/or function objects when referenced data objects and/or function objects change. Functions within the function objects are solved when the messages are received. The data objects and/or the function objects are stored in a distributed manner across multiple computing devices on a computer network. At least one of the data objects is defined as an input data object and at least one of the data objects is defined as an output data object to a search engine, the search engine generating changes to the input data object until the output data object satisfies a predefined criteria.

Models can describe objects (entities) and their inter-relationships using mathematical equations. For example, a spreadsheet tool can be used to build a financial model of a particular business (system) to predict financial behavior, thus allowing a user to evaluate and choose among various solutions (designs).","Certain models are constructed from a set of modules (objects) that present an input and output interface. The inputs and outputs form connections and dependencies to use in integrating the objects to construct the model. Individual objects, although integrated, may be stored in a distributed fashion over a computer network. Objects themselves may be comprised of multiple objects.","Different types of objects are used to relate information concerning different aspects of the system being modeled. Physical\/mechanical modeling can produce solid models, surface models, three-dimensional models, two-dimensional models, and wire-frame models, and can be used to convey the physical aspects of a system within a defined space. Design modeling can be built to predict a system's behavior for a given set of design variables. Design models allow for the modification of their input variables to achieve a desired performance characteristic. Evaluation models can compare performance characteristics of a design model against specific value structures to access design alternatives.","The product design process is an example of a process that can include physical modeling, design modeling and evaluation modeling. Some people refer to these models in product design as Simulation Based Design. Product design is a complex and collaborative process that is often multi-disciplinary and multi-objective. These aspects of the product design process require a robust modeling framework.","An example of Simulation Based Design (\u201cSBD\u201d) is a program sponsored by the Defense Advanced Research Project Agency (\u201cDARPA\u201d) in cooperation with Lockheed Martin Missiles & Space company. The goal of SBD software is to enable an enterprise to perform \u201cfaster, better, cheaper\u201d by establishing flexible, efficient communications channels among human participants and software tools across heterogenous resources. This work is directed to developing a collaborative distributed computing infrastructure. Their work can be used as a framework for providing interoperability for a range of software (e.g., design\/modeling) tools based on a Common Object Request Broker Architecture (\u201cCORBA\u201d) backplane. The NetBuilder application from Lockheed Martin Missiles & Space company is a framework for integrating and linking design and modeling components. An object-oriented repository for storing model components and a dynamic object server for maintaining various aspects of product development and interactions between multiple development disciplines. Legacy components within the NetBuilder framework are \u201cwrapped\u201d to encapsulate their capabilities, allowing legacy components to be linked with non-legacy components within the framework. Agents are also used within the NetBuilder framework to encapsulate information management paradigms, publish\/subscribe information and manage automation of distributed workflow processes. NetBuilder acts as middleware to coordinate the development process.","MIT-DOME (Distrilbuted Object-based Modeling and Evaluation) is a distributed modeling environment for integrated modeling that is used at the MIT CADLab (Senin, 1997; Pahng, 1998). In this environment, designers can easily build object-oriented models visualized as entity-relationship graphs. Both discrete and continuous variable types are allowed in the models. Models can be arranged into sub-models, these sub-models can be referenced in so called \u201ccatalogs\u201d that allow for the selection of different sub-models when constructing a model. In MIT-DOME, model inputs with uncertain values can be defined as probability density functions, and these uncertainties are automatically propagated through the model using Monte Carlo simulation and other methods. MIT-DOME users also set goals or specifications and are provided with a design alternative which can be calculated. A built-in optimization tool, using a genetic algorithm as a solver, manipulates independent parameters and catalog choices to find an optimal tradeoff between model goals.","Existing modeling frameworks (e.g., MIT's DOME) do provide some physical modeling, design modeling and evaluation modeling within a distributed and integrated framework, but these frameworks lack the ability to create emergent models.","An emergent model is a model that is created without a predefined or global definition, such that the emergent model arises from a dynamic, integrated model built on a distributed, multi-computing device network. An emergent model is comprised of data objects (modules) and\/or function objects (modules) that are linked and distributed across multiple computing devices on a computer network. A search engine is disclosed for optimizing an emergent model on a computer network","The present invention provides the capability to publish model data and integrate that data to predict system performance. The emergent model is then evaluated and optimized. The present invention can be viewed as a Web Server for engineering, product and business data. No other company currently provides customers a means to create live data links across the Internet in a software neutral environment for the purpose of creating an emergent model. The Web-enabled, realtime business-to-business interfaces of the present invention reduce the time\/cost to market for product development, as well as increase abilities to manage the product supply chain.","Accordingly, the present invention provides access control for a model on a computer network. In one embodiment of the present invention a method for providing access control for an emergent model comprises generating data objects and\/or function objects, publishing references to the data objects and\/or the function objects and subscribing to the data objects and\/or the functions by creating relationships between the data objects and\/or the function objects through referencing data objects within the function objects, thereby linking the data objects and\/or the function objects, wherein networks of linked data objects and\/or function objects emerge. The emergent linked data objects and\/or function objects are make available for further linking with other data objects and\/or function objects and messages are sent to referencing data objects and\/or function objects when referenced data objects and\/or referenced function objects change. The functions are solved when the messages are received, thereby causing at least one of the referenced data to be changed. The data objects and\/or the function objects are stored in a distributed manner across multiple computing devices on a computer network. The emergent linked data objects and\/or function objects are independently published to, and subscribed to, in a manner free of a globally predefined data object and\/or function object definition, thereby generating the emergent model. Access control is provided by identifying users of the emergent model and assigning appropriate read, write, execute and administrative permissions on a per data objects and\/or function objects basis such that the permissions are used to limit access to the data objects and\/or function objects. At least one of the data objects is defined as an input data object and defining at least one of data objects is defined as an output data object to a search engine, the search engine generating changes to the input data object until the output data object satisfies a predefined criteria.","A description of preferred embodiments of the invention follows. Various subsets of the above described distributed combinations exist in the prior art. Many systems provide non-distributed storage, execution and access (fully-centralized). MIT-DOME provides distributed storage with non-distributed execution and access. Other systems (e.g., ModelCenter\u2122 by Phoenix Integration of Blacksburg, Va.) provide various combinations of distributed execution, storage or access, but only the present invention combines fully-distributed execution, storage and access to generate emergent models.","In a system generating an emergent model it is often desirable to represent aspects of the system using an object-oriented paradigm, in which a system is viewed as a collection of discrete objects that are self-contained collections of data structures and routines having the ability to interact with other objects in the system. Object-oriented systems provide for the definition of classes that are used to create (instantiate) objects of that class. The objects allow for the encapsulation of data and provide well defined interfaces for other objects to use when sending data to, or receiving data from, an object. One class definition can inherit the capabilities of another, allowing more complex classes to be built from simpler, underlying classes. These classes can also specify certain behaviors that are only fully defined at run-time. The combination of features provided in object-oriented systems help create a platform for hosting an embodiment of the present invention used to generate emergent models.","In the present invention, models are collections of computer instructions and data that present an interface for describing the behavior of part of a system being modeled, such that the interface is understood by other parts of the system. The present invention provides for generating an emergent model consisting of one or more models where a model consists of one or more objects, therefore a model can contain a complex hierarchy of submodels. Objects can be model inputs and outputs that are made available to relate various models to one another. These objects are implemented using standard distributed object management techniques (e.g., CORBA, DCOM). As such, each object has a corresponding object reference.","CORBA stands for Common Object Request Broker Architecture. A specification developed by the Object Management Group in 1992 in which pieces of programs (objects) communicate with other objects in other programs, even if the two programs are written in different programming languages and are running on different computing platforms. A program makes its request for objects through an object request broker (ORB), and thus does not need to know the structure of the program from where the object comes. DCOM is an acronym for Distributed Component Object Model, the version of Microsoft's Component Object Model (COM) specification that stipulates how components, communicate over Windows-based networks. DCOM permits the distribution of different components for a single application across two or more networked computers, running an application distributed across a network so that the distribution of components is not apparent to the user, and remotely displaying an application.","In the present invention, the object reference can consist of a relative Uniform Resource Identifier (URL) component and\/or a unique Uniform Resource Identifier (URI) component. Distributed object management techniques provide for the resolution of an object reference into a proxy object suitable for making method invocations on the corresponding remote object. Techniques for sending messages between objects in a distributed object system are common. The present invention sends and receives change messages that contain the object reference of the source of the message as well as information indicating how the source object changed. Common to message sending techniques is the option of having the sending object block or not block while the receiving object processes the message. In the present invention, blocking message processing is used.","In the present invention, objects have two primary types, that of data objects and function objects. Objects can have objects and\/or object references as attributes allowing objects to be used to organize other objects. Objects can have attributes that are of numeric (e.g., floating point, integer and imaginary), string, boolean, vector, matrix, table and file type. Numeric attributes can be deterministic or probabilistic. Interdependencies or relationships within a model can be defined using function objects. Interfaces to existing information or systems can be defined using a combination of data objects and function objects.","In the present invention, objects can have constraints that are used to define the behavior of an object. Constraints are attributes of each object, are associated with methods of the object and corresponding constraints are checked when method invocations are made on the object. If a check indicates that a corresponding constraint is violated the method invocation is not completed, which can result in an error message\/code being returned to the invoker of the method. Constraints can be placed on an object such that it will be unavailable as an input and\/or an output of a model. Types of constraints include but are not limited to dependency constraints, permissions\/access control constraints, data type constraints, units constraints and message propagation constraints.","A dependency constraint can be added to a data object when the data object's value is set by a function object. While the constraint is in place, only that function object corresponding to the constraint can set the value of the data object. Objects that are dependent on other objects can only be outputs (read-only) because their values are constrained by that dependency. Once an object has a dependency constraint additional dependency relationships can not be created with other function objects. Dependency constraints prevent loops from being formed in the relationships between objects.","Access\/permission settings are another way in which to create constraints on an object. Information specifying which users or objects can view, edit, execute (solve) or administrate an object are placed in an access policy constraint. Invocations of methods on objects that have access constraints are only permitted if the invoker is listed in the constraint as having permission to invoke the method. For example, a getValue( ) method can only be invoked by an invoker with view permissions in the corresponding access constraint. Objects are only outputs for users with read-only permissions for those objects (e.g., a read-only object can not be written by another function object). Objects are only inputs for users with write-only permissions for those objects. Objects are inputs and outputs for users with read-write permissions for those objects.","Message propagation constraints are checked when a message is sent and\/or received, which can prevent messages from being sent or received. Message propagation constraints can reference message routing information such as source and destination object references and message content information such as the new or old value associated with a value change of a data object. Access constraints are also used as message constraints to prevent users from obtaining data in messages for objects for which they do not have permissions to view data. A \u201ctrigger\u201d message constraint on a function object determines when a function object is \u201ctriggered\u201d to solve its expression. Trigger constraint modes include: \u201cany\u201d, \u201call\u201d, \u201cnone\u201d and \u201ccustom\u201d. The \u201cany\u201d trigger allows a function object to solve when any object referenced by function sends a message that it changed, whereas \u201cnone\u201d prevents automatic re-evaluation when objects referenced by the function object change. The \u201call\u201d trigger requires that all objects referenced by the function send change messages in order for a re-evaluation to occur. The \u201ccustom\u201d trigger is a hook provided for another object to determine if a function should be solved.","Data objects contain data as attributes and provide methods for getting and setting the attributes. A data object sends a change message to objects registered to listen for change messages when the data object changes. A number data object is an example of a data object implemented by the present invention. A number object has a name, value and units attributes, as well as an access policy constraint associated with the methods of the object. When values of data objects are set, coercion is performed using common techniques and rules. Data objects that are coercible without data loss are coerced. Coercion that could result in data loss is detected and can be flagged for approval by a user.","A unit is a particular physical quantity, defined and adopted by convention, with which other particular quantities of the same kind are compared to express their value. The International System of Units (SI) defines seven base units:",{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0043","num":"0042"},"tables":{"@attributes":{"id":"TABLE-US-00001","num":"00001"},"table":{"@attributes":{"frame":"none","colsep":"0","rowsep":"0"},"tgroup":{"@attributes":{"align":"left","colsep":"0","rowsep":"0","cols":"3"},"colspec":[{"@attributes":{"colname":"offset","colwidth":"42pt","align":"left"}},{"@attributes":{"colname":"1","colwidth":"98pt","align":"left"}},{"@attributes":{"colname":"2","colwidth":"77pt","align":"left"}}],"thead":{"row":{"entry":[{},{"@attributes":{"namest":"offset","nameend":"2","align":"center","rowsep":"1"}}]}},"tbody":{"@attributes":{"valign":"top"},"row":[{"entry":[{},"length","meter,"]},{"entry":[{},"mass","kilogram,"]},{"entry":[{},"time","second,"]},{"entry":[{},"electric current","ampere,"]},{"entry":[{},"thermodynamic","temperature,"]},{"entry":[{},"amount of substance","mole,"]},{"entry":[{},"luminous intensity","candela."]},{"entry":[{},{"@attributes":{"namest":"offset","nameend":"2","align":"center","rowsep":"1"}}]}]}}}}},"Function objects provide behavior by providing expressions that can relate data objects and function objects thereby creating networks of linked function objects and data objects. Function objects have a name, an expression, an object reference table and a solver attribute as well as access policy and trigger message propagation constraints. The expression can be thought of as a function with a plurality of inputs and output objects, which is evaluated by the solver. The expression text can be defined using various programming languages including Basic, C, C++ and Java, among others. The object reference table can contain references to data objects and function objects. The expression text can contain portions that specify method calls on the objects referenced in the object reference table. The solver evaluates the expression text, which may result in changes to objects referenced by the function object. Solvers can be implemented using compilers, interpreters or entire legacy applications. The function object solves the expression when a change message is received from one of the objects referenced by the function object. Function objects can also be solved manually by a user. Dependency constraints are optionally placed on data objects that have their values set by the expression of a function object.","An equivalence function object is an example of a function object implemented with the present invention. The following simplified example illustrates an equivalence function object that keeps several data objects equivalent (i.e., if one of the data object values changes, then the other data object values are changed such that their values match). In this example, the equivalence function is used in combination with a number data object, further providing an example of a message propagation constraint being applied.",{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0046","num":"0045"},"tables":{"@attributes":{"id":"TABLE-US-00002","num":"00002"},"table":{"@attributes":{"frame":"none","colsep":"0","rowsep":"0"},"tgroup":{"@attributes":{"align":"left","colsep":"0","rowsep":"0","cols":"1"},"colspec":{"@attributes":{"colname":"1","colwidth":"217pt","align":"left"}},"thead":{"row":{"entry":{"@attributes":{"namest":"1","nameend":"1","align":"center","rowsep":"1"}}}},"tbody":{"@attributes":{"valign":"top"},"row":[{"entry":"function object: equivalence {"},{"entry":"\u2003referenced objects table"},{"entry":"\u2003receive message {"},{"entry":"\u2003\u2003if (constraints are met) {"},{"entry":"\u2003\u2003\u2003solve the function expression using solver( )"},{"entry":"\u2003\u2003}"},{"entry":"\u2003}"},{"entry":"\u2003function expression {"},{"entry":"\u2003\u2003get the changed object value"},{"entry":"\u2003\u2003for (each referenced table entry) {"},{"entry":"\u2003\u2003\u2003if (reference does not correspond to changed object) {"},{"entry":"\u2003\u2003\u2003\u2003set referenced object value to the obtained object value"},{"entry":"\u2003\u2003\u2003}"},{"entry":"\u2003\u2003}"},{"entry":"\u2003}"},{"entry":"\u2003solver {"},{"entry":"\u2003\u2003solve the function expression..."},{"entry":"\u2003}"},{"entry":"\u2003access policy constraints {"},{"entry":"\u2003\u2003\u2003check invoker permissions..."},{"entry":"\u2003\u2003}"},{"entry":"\u2003\u2003add object reference {"},{"entry":"\u2003\u2003\u2003add an entry in the referenced objects table"},{"entry":"\u2003\u2003\u2003register with the object to enable message receiving"},{"entry":"\u2003\u2003}"},{"entry":"\u2003\u2003remove object reference {"},{"entry":"\u2003\u2003\u2003remove an entry in the referenced objects table"},{"entry":"\u2003\u2003\u2003de-register with the object to disable message receiving"},{"entry":"\u2003\u2003}"},{"entry":"}"},{"entry":"data object: number {"},{"entry":"\u2003table of object references of registered message receivers"},{"entry":"\u2003name"},{"entry":"\u2003value"},{"entry":"\u2003set value method {"},{"entry":"\u2003\u2003set number value to new value"},{"entry":"\u2003\u2003for (each reference table entry) {"},{"entry":"\u2003\u2003\u2003if (message propagation and access constraints are met)"},{"entry":"\u2003\u2003\u2003\u2003send a message to referenced object indicating"},{"entry":"\u2003\u2003\u2003\u2003\u2003value has changed"},{"entry":"\u2003\u2003\u2003}"},{"entry":"\u2003\u2003}"},{"entry":"\u2003}"},{"entry":"\u2003get value method {"},{"entry":"\u2003provide number value to requester;"},{"entry":"\u2003}"},{"entry":"\u2003message propagation constraint {"},{"entry":"\u2003\u2003if (reference corresponds to the object value changer) {"},{"entry":"\u2003\u2003\u2003disallow the message to be sent"},{"entry":"\u2003\u2003} else {"},{"entry":"\u2003\u2003\u2003allow message to be sent"},{"entry":"\u2003\u2003}"},{"entry":"\u2003}"},{"entry":"\u2003access policy constraint {"},{"entry":"\u2003\u2003all users and\/or objects can get and set the name and value"},{"entry":"\u2003}"},{"entry":"\u2003add object reference {"},{"entry":"\u2003\u2003add an entry in the table of object"},{"entry":"\u2003\u2003references of registered message receivers"},{"entry":"\u2003}"},{"entry":"\u2003remove object reference {"},{"entry":"\u2003\u2003remove an entry in the table of object"},{"entry":"\u2003\u2003references of registered message receivers"},{"entry":"\u2003}"},{"entry":"}"},{"entry":{"@attributes":{"namest":"1","nameend":"1","align":"center","rowsep":"1"}}}]}}}}},"A model is generated by creating instances of data objects and\/or function objects. In the process of generating, the contents of an object can be obtained from and coordinated with the data and or functions of a legacy application using the known application programming interfaces (APIs) of the application. For example, a data module can have its value match that of a cell in a spreadsheet.","An object is made available by publishing it. Publishing is done using standard distributed object management techniques whereby objects are made available in a standard way to be activated and used by a subscriber to the object. When published, each data object and function object has an object reference that can be used to access and control that object. Once an object is published, the object's object reference, usually a URL, is communicated to prospective users via conventional techniques (e-mail, posting a message), or a prospective user initiates a search that reveals the object reference of the published object.","A object is subscribed to by adding the object reference to the referenced objects table of a function object. This also results in have a reference to the function object placed in the table of message recieves of the referenced object, which is a standard part of enabling messages to be sent from referenced objects to referencing objects.","When a referenced object changes a message will be sent to any referencing objects which will solve their expressions subject to constraints. Solving the expressions may result in data objects being changed.","At any time additional objects can be generated, published and subscribed to by different users or objects representing users. As these steps are carried out a network of linked data objects and function objects emerges which is an emergent model. These steps can also be guided by a definition of a network of objects that is desired.","The values of the data objects of an emergent model can be optimized. Standard optimization packages are available that can be interfaced in known ways to an object environment such as the one described in the present invention. For example, known optimization algorithms can be accessed by the expression of a function object so that the optimization algorithm will be run when the function object is solved. Objects are identified as inputs and outputs for the optimization algorithm to use. The optimization algorithm is given a set of typical criteria for stopping the algorithm to prevent too many resources from being consumed. When the optimization algorithm is run it changes the input objects according to the algorithm design and the resulting changes to the output objects. The output objects change because they are linked to the input objects in a network of function objects and data objects. The optimization stops when the stopping conditions are reached, after which the optimal values of the data objects can be viewed or accessed by other data objects.",{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0053","num":"0052"},"figref":"FIG. 1","b":["50","100","300","100","102","104","106","100","100","110","100","102","104","106","110","100","110","106"]},{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0054","num":"0053"},"figref":["FIG. 2","FIG. 1"],"b":["100","50","100","204","100","50","204","204","206","206","106","204","208","210","204","204","212","110","100","100","110","200","202","200","100"]},{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0055","num":"0054"},"figref":"FIG. 3","b":["300","300","50","302","374","302","322","352","374","300"]},"Models (-) are collections of computer instructions and data that present an interface for describing the behavior of part of a system being modeled, such that the interface is understood by other parts of the system.
