Field of the Invention","The present invention relates to a business billing management process or package intended for charging for Internet access on a \u201cpay-as-you-go\u201d basis. More specifically, the billing package (or modules) captures all web-based transactions involving browsing pages for content or purchasing materials and\/or products on the Internet. This pay-as-you-go handling is based on both a time period in cyberspace for viewing and the materials and\/or products selected for download to the users chosen device.","2. Description of the Related Art","Access into the Internet and user usage of domains and web sites by any means are currently free from any toll charges. Methods and systems for ordering merchandise from a remote terminal, as well as devices and systems for handling associated monetary transactions on the Internet and other communications networks, are known.","The prior art methods and systems for ordering merchandise from a remote terminal have focused on paying for only the goods ordered on line. For example, U.S. Pat. No. 4,734,858 issued on Mar. 29, 1988 to Schlafly, as well as WIPO Patent Document No. WO 85\/02700 issued on Jun. 20, 1985, are directed to a pocket size data terminal and system for placing orders telephonically via a local processing center (LPC). Orders for goods or services are accumulated in the terminal and sent to the local processing center (LPC) in a short burst. A personal identification code is used for security.","U.S. Pat. No. 4,984,155, issued on Jan. 8, 1991 to Geier et al., discusses a data terminal for ordering goods or services from a supplier. The terminal is part of an order entry system having catalog assistance, and is primarily used for product selection, inventory checking and ordering assistance.","U.S. Pat. No. 5,515,268, issued on May 7, 1996 to Yoda, discloses a method and system for ordering products. A sensor detects a customer's size and a local computer system provides this sizing information to a remote computer system. The remote system provides fitting, availability and inventory information back to the local computer system.","U.S. Pat. No. 5,528,490, issued on Jun. 18, 1996 to Hill, outlines an electronic catalog system and method. This invention deals primarily with availability, data updating and security (determining pirated accessing software).","U.S. Pat. No. 5,664,110, issued on Sep. 2, 1997 to Green et al., discloses a remote ordering system that allows a users to construct one or more order lists in a local device (computer). The local device queries a remote device for updating, while still maintaining a user readable local order list.","U.S. Pat. No. 5,745,681, issued on Apr. 28, 1998 to Levine et al., teaches the concept of a stateless shopping cart for the web. This invention deals mainly with displaying and selecting products or services via \u201cshopping cart fields\u201d and \u201cshopping page files\u201d that are managed at the client's station","Devices and systems for handling monetary transactions on the Internet and other communications networks, have been the subject of prior patents.","U.S. Pat. No. 5,475,585, issued on Dec. 12, 1995 to Bush, discloses a transactional processing system which allows for real-time authorization of payments for a plurality of products and services made available to individual computerized subscribers by a transmitting source (\u201ca cable, telephone company, microwave, TVRO or DBS operator\u201d). This system handles product or service selection, multiple vendors, billing, inventory checking and security using an electrically erasable Subscriber ID.","U.S. Pat. No. 5,508,913, issued on Apr. 16, 1996 to Yamamoto et al., describes an electronic dealing system which performs foreign exchange transactions among banks and\/or brokers by matching terms of sale and terms of purchase.","U.S. Pat. No. 5,692,132, issued on Nov. 25, 1997 to Hogan, describes a system and method for conducting cashless transactions on a computer network such as the Internet. The invention deals primarily with monetary transactions, specifically in the form of various methods of extending credit over the Internet without the use of a central computer.","U.S. Pat. No. 5,727,163, issued on Mar. 10, 1998 to Bezos involves a secure method for communicating credit card data when placing an order on a non-secure network. The method uses a sub-set of the credit card number as a verification code.","None of the above inventions and patents, taken either singularly or in combination, is seen to describe the instant invention as claimed. The prior art systems fail to provide a complete billing management package. That is, one that can handle all aspects of Internet access toll charges, billing for time spent (pay-as-you-go) in cyberspace (or a specific domain). Thus a billing management package for charging for Internet access and web page utilization solving the aforementioned problems is desired.","The present invention is a software package, which handles all web-based access as chargeable transactions on a pay-as-you-go basis for browsing and purchasing products, services, and\/or data on the Internet. The present invention provides a complete billing management package. That is, one that can handle all aspects of Internet access toll charges. These include billing for time spent (pay-as-you-go) in cyberspace (or a specific domain). Preferably, the charges would include guest and member registration; access to global web pages; commercial and\/or private content and product selection and\/or selected pages downloaded; broker charges for multiple (domain) product selections; voice access telephony software, CTI (computer telephony integration), VOIP (voice over IP); multi-lingual transactions, multi-currency transactions (monetary exchange and tax withholdings) and security. The software is designed to be loaded on an individual web or web server for front ending of multiple domains and\/or access to other domains through Internet servers. In this way, the package has access to as many already written applications (open standards) as possible for the transfer of data or voice (convergence). This access allows the software to deal with access to web pages, content viewing and product selection, and billing the user for time spent browsing the web pages or pages downloaded, and acting as a broker for multiple domain product selections. The billing software package includes several \u2018modules\u201d, each of which handles different access transactions for browsing and purchasing on the Internet.","By combining all of the access functions required into a single billing management package, the present invention maximizes the effectiveness of recognized Internet vendor systems and shoppers alike.","The access module handles persistent state (user connection\/reconnection to the server); a web domain database (initial and local) for user records and commerce records (including individual web site products bought, commerce site products viewed, time to date (mall favorites and knowledge site favorites list(s)), membership discounts and specials (customized); spending\/spent by both banking and direct debit (customized).","The access module also handles global Internet functions such as digital or other ID verification systems (certificate), X-500 and other directory services, VPN (Virtual Private Network) cost routing, security through firewall, PKI (Public Key Interface) encryption and other access services.","The database module handles all relevant contact and billing information on the user, including individual web site products bought, commerce site products viewed, time used to date (mall favorites and knowledge site favorites list(s) most frequently used), membership discounts and specials (customized), such as for example Sam's club; spending\/spent by both banking and direct debit (customized), for example Quicken.","The billing module handles time and\/or products or pages within domain or multi-domains, including database records detailing archive and retrieval, merchant interaction by time and\/or product, and ordering product(s); filter words and primary keys VOIP (voice over IP) ordering product, VOIP general telephone\/fax calls, catalog browse\/order and downloading for later viewing; and bank accounts, credit cards, credit\/debit ratings, tax and foreign exchange (payment controls such as [example] SET, SSL, Cybercash, or Digicash), invoice, copy and records control, shipping control and fax or e-mail confirmation.","The API (Application Programming Interface) modules are built-in wizards, utilizing a shared repository operating communications as in handling all interacting and management of: synchronization of data anytime, anywhere on a standards based environment that allows any network computer, PC or other client device to interact with any application or data server over any network; allowing bi-directional replication; continuous support over a variety of standard networks, including cellular digital, packet radio, dial-up and local area network connections and is optimized to be used now and is seamlessly adaptable to new technologies.","Accordingly, it is a principal object of the invention to provide a billing management package that handles all charges for all access methods to the Internet, for example, by ASP\/ISP, website or domain.","It is a further object of the invention to provide billing based on time in cyber-space used for browsing (real time), pages downloaded (later viewing) and purchasing material(s) and\/or product(s) or service(s) on the Internet.","It is another object of the invention to provide a billing package that can handle multi-cash transactions as well as multi-currency transactions, including taxation charges specific to country, state or per item tax.","It is another object of the invention to provide a billing package that can handle multi-language transactions for translation into chosen language.","It is an object of the invention to provide improved elements and arrangements thereof for the purposes described which is inexpensive, dependable and fully effective in accomplishing its intended purposes.","These and other objects of the present invention will become readily apparent upon further review of the following specification and drawings.","Similar reference characters denote corresponding features consistently throughout the attached drawings.","The present invention is a billing management software package, which handles all web-based access as transactions for browsing and purchasing material(s) and\/or product(s) or service(s) on the Internet. The billing is based on time in cyber-space and\/or material\/product(s) selected for download. In , a representative schematic view is shown of: the world wide web A; the \u201csystem\u201d of the present invention; the various web sites of supplying vendors or service providers B; the various customers C; and the interconnections there between. It should be noted that the different systems are shown as PCs simply to be representative, and that the business computers B would most likely be mainframe or internal networks themselves. To insure global reach and utilization the computer software used in the present invention is designed to be loaded on a web server for front ending of multiple domains and\/or access to other domains through Internet or for an individual web (domain).","The software package of the present invention is designed to utilize as many already written (open standards) applications as possible, being able to utilize API for the bi-directional transfer of bit-stream and allow the software to deal with access to web pages, content viewing and product selection, billing the user for access time spent within (browsing) the web pages or for pages downloaded, and acting as a broker for multiple product selections by managing conduct of a simplified transaction for the user. While the software can be written in any language, the present code of the open software program is in Java, with later porting to Active X and Visual Basic possible. While initially intended to be in English\/American, language software modules for Spanish and other primary languages are proposed. The billing software package includes several modules, each of which handles different transactions for browsing and purchasing on the Internet.","A user enters the software from an initial domain, and non-members are routed to a guest register where they are initiated into the system. After registering and selecting a web, the user then enters terms or words to search for desired products, services, and\/or data. Found products, services, and data are downloaded and the user browses through the downloaded products. While browsing, the user can process orders and select different domains. Once the order is compiled, catalog processing is handled for the different items. Should the user wish to continue in another mall, they are rerouted to browse. As long as the user continues to browse, the billing module updates the records to indicate elapsed time by online timing, or alternatively the number of pages downloaded. After the user is finished, the billing module then handles payment processing. Product or multiple products are collected as one debit from the user, but handling of credits for each supplier is done separately. Membership in a particular domain may entitle the user to reduced costs or discounts or other promotions. After all of the above is considered, shipping is confirmed, the user is debited, and the vendors are credited. The user's records are then updated, time or page count is deducted, and any member credits are given.","The access module is responsible for maintaining \u2018state\u2019 (user connection\/reconnection to the server); a web domain database (initial and local) for user records and commerce records, including individual site products bought, commerce site products viewed, time to date (mall favorites) list, membership discounts and specials (customized) and spending\/spent by both banking and direct debit (customized). The access module also handles global Internet functions such as digital or other ID verification systems, X-500 and other directory services, VPN (Virtual Private Network) cost routing, firewall and other access services.","The billing module is responsible for time, and\/or products within domain or multidomains (database records including archive and retrieval, merchant interaction by time and\/or product, and ordering product); pages downloaded; filter words and primary keys (VOIP ordering product, VOIP general telephone\/fax calls, catalog browse\/order and downloading for later viewing). The billing module also handles bank account systems, credit cards, credit\/debit ratings, tax and foreign exchange (payment controls, such as for example, SET, SSL, Cybercash or Digicash etc., invoice copy records control, shipping control and fax and or email confirmation).","The payment module is responsible for billing credit\/debit transactions and includes multicash transactions as well as multi-currency transactions which are updated and confirmed by accessing web sites for conversion rates. Product or multiple products or service offerings are collected as one debit from the user, but handling of credits, wires, fax calls, etc. for each supplier is done separately. Membership in a particular website\/domain may entitle the user to reduced costs or discounts, or other promotional offerings. After all of the above is qualified, if required, shipping is confirmed, the user is debited, and the vendors are credited. If a certain time or monetary limit (lock) has been introduced, (by the user or a creditor) an applied % output may be provided.",{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0041","num":"0040"},"figref":"FIG. 2"},"Members and non-members then select their name (generated in the guest register) and initial domain\/website. Upon selecting a web, the user's ID is checked by the billing module. Security for the software package including ID checks can be provided using for example PGP (Pretty Good Privacy) shareware, trusted sites, such as for example, Microsoft 128 key encryption code and, for example, Verisign programming for credit authority. The user then enters words and\/or other terms to search for desired products, services, and data.","As found, the selected products, services, and data are downloaded (records updated), the user has a choice of access transaction, time billing or per page billing. The transmission of data is dependent upon throughput. Where the user has fast access and reliable throughput, the time billing option is generally preferred. If the user has poor access and unreliable throughput, per page billing is generally preferred.","As the user browses through the downloaded products, online timing is activated for time billing. This operates with a clock to be set at a per minute\/second counting depending on the instruction received from the browsed web site.","Per page billing operates with a page counter. The page counter is set at each complete page downloaded from the instruction received from the browsed site. The page counter may be incremented in various ways, such as returning a byte count to the user's home domain. The cost per page is in U.S. dollars (set as default), or other currency set by the browsed web site.","While browsing, the user can process orders and select different shops\/malls (interactive domains) or knowledge sites (domains). Knowledge sites, for example, may be sites acting as repositories for published works, technical works, intellectual works, research and library works or chat rooms or gaming arenas.","VOIP processing and other voice and fax calls are handled for associated selected products or services. Once the order is compiled, catalog processing is handled for the different items. Should the user wish to continue in another website\/domain, they are rerouted to browse. As long as the user continues to browse, the clock or page counter updates the records. For example, elapsed time may be indicated in one minute or one second blocks. After the user completes browsing or products selection, the timing or page counting is halted and final processing begins.","Prior to exiting the program, the user's records are updated, a billing stamp is recorded (time or page stamp), time or page is deducted according to the billing stamp, and any member credits are given. As with the products, time or page billing may be reduced for members of certain domains, as the billing is accrued as time in each domain or pages downloaded. In addition, buying products and\/or services may accrue credit to the user in terms of free or reduced cost time or pages in the program.","It is to be understood that the present invention is not limited to the embodiments described above, but encompasses any and all embodiments within the scope of the following claims."],"BRFSUM":[{},{}],"brief-description-of-drawings":[{},{}],"description-of-drawings":{"heading":"BRIEF DESCRIPTION OF THE DRAWINGS","p":[{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0032","num":"0031"},"figref":"FIG. 1"},{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0033","num":"0032"},"figref":"FIG. 2"}]},"DETDESC":[{},{}]}
