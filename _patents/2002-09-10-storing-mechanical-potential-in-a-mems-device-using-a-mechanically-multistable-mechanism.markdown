{"@attributes":{"id":"description"},"GOVINT":[{},{}],"heading":["GOVERNMENT INTERESTS","TECHNICAL FIELD","BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION","BRIEF SUMMARY OF THE INVENTION","DETAILED DESCRIPTION OF THE INVENTION"],"p":["The invention was made with Governmental support under Contract 70NANB1H3021 awarded by the National Institute of Standards and Technology (NIST), Grants and Agreements Management Division, 100 Bureau Drive, MAIL STOP 3580, Building 411, Room A143, Gaithersburg, Md. 20899-3580. The Government has certain rights in the invention.","The present application relates in general to microelectromechanical systems (MEMS), and, more specifically, to a system for storing potential energy in a MEMS device using a multi-stable mechanism.","MEM devices have many applications for forming any variety of microsensors, microactuators, and other microcomponents. The term \u201cmicrocomponent\u201d is used herein generically to encompass sub-millimeter electronic\/mechanical components, as well as MEM devices, MEM Systems (MEMS) components, and nanoelectromechanical (NEM) devices and systems (NEMS). Microcomponents include such devices as grippers, connectors, relays, and the like. Because of the size of the components and the relative size of the elements that make up these components, it is generally important to have precise positioning, especially in fastening applications. Unless the two devices to be connected or fastened are positioned correctly, the resulting joint may not be properly fit.","Furthermore, in some applications, grippers, connectors, receptacles, and the like, typically consume considerable energy to be \u201cheld\u201d in an open and\/or closed position. Therefore, in the application of a gripper, for example, electricity may be applied to hold the gripper either open or closed, depending on the design of the gripper. Thus, if the gripper must hold an item for an extended period of time, the electricity must be applied continuously. If, during the holding period, the electricity cannot be maintained, the gripper may let go of the item resulting in possible loss or damage.","It is advantageous to have a microcomponent capable of storing potential energy that can then be used to drive another action of the microcomponent. One current system that stores potential energy in connecting and fastening devices is described in U.S. Pat. No. 5,806,152 issued to Saitou et al., (Saitou).  is a schematic top view of a connecting device configured with a latching mechanism to hold the device in an open position, as described in Saitou. Fastener  includes outer latch  and inner latch mechanism . To facilitate proper operation of fastener , outer latch  is anchored to the substrate at , and inner latch  is anchored to the substrate at .","In operation, fastener  is cocked by depressing fastener  at . As  moves toward the foot of the device, latches  will be inserted into holders  forming a latched, friction fit. The latching action, thus, stores the potential energy applied in depressing fastener  at . Fastener  is then held in an open position without applied electricity or other continuous energy. As cocked fastener  is used to pick up object , the top of object  engages inner latch  which would then cause latches  to be removed from holder . Fastener  would then snap into a locked position with latches  clamping into holders  to hold object  in place. The potential energy stored in the latching process increases the clamping force which has the effect of self-positioning object .","The problem with the Saitou device is that it is anchored to the substrate, and thus, not very mobile. Furthermore, the holding mechanism relies on the strength and formation of the latches and latch-holders and the frictional forces between the latches and the latch-holder. Therefore, if a latch is misformed during manufacture or is deformed through an external force, the latch would not typically hold securely and could not store the potential energy in the device. Additionally, the latch portion may also shear off if an excessive amount of stressed is placed on the device.","The present invention is directed to a system and method for storing potential energy in a microcomponent comprising a multi-stable element having two or more equilibrium states and a stopper to restrict the multi-stable element from completely reaching at least one of the two or more equilibrium states. The pre-charged microcomponent may then preferably be transported to another location and use the stored potential energy to perform some action.","The foregoing has outlined rather broadly the features and technical advantages of the present invention in order that the detailed description of the invention that follows may be better understood. Additional features and advantages of the invention will be described hereinafter which form the subject of the claims of the invention. It should be appreciated by those skilled in the art that the conception and specific embodiment disclosed may be readily utilized as a basis for modifying or designing other structures for carrying out the same purposes of the present invention. It should also be realized by those skilled in the art that such equivalent constructions do not depart from the spirit and scope of the invention as set forth in the appended claims. The novel features which are believed to be characteristic of the invention, both as to its organization and method of operation, together with further objects and advantages will be better understood from the following description when considered in connection with the accompanying figures. It is to be expressly understood, however, that each of the figures is provided for the purpose of illustration and description only and is not intended as a definition of the limits of the present invention.","Instead of relying on the friction fit latching mechanism from Saitou, one embodiment of the present invention relies on a multi-stable element, such as a bistable device, to supply the energy storing mechanism. A bistable device is generally an element having two low-energy, equilibrium states, such that the device will typically remain in one of the two states unless energy is applied to the device to switch it into the other state. Because of this functionality, bistable devices have been used for switches, relays, and the like.","Many different types of bistable devices have been devised for use as such switches, relays, actuators, and the like. One such device is disclosed in U.S. Pat. No. 6,303,885 to Hichwa, et al., (Hichwa).  is a schematic representation of the bistable micro-switch disclosed in Hichwa. The Hichwa-described device  consists essentially of spring arms  and  working in conjunction with center beam . As the center beam  is pushed toward the second state, the spring arms  and  build up resistance force until the entire unit is pushed over the snap-through point, at which the switch is tripped to the other state, as shown in , with center beam  held in the second equilibrium position. Spring arms  and  are in compression due to the spring action. This compression essentially creates the two states necessary for the bistable condition.",{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0033","num":"0032"},"figref":["FIG. 3A","FIG. 3B"],"b":["30","300","304","305","307","30","302","305","307","305","307"]},"Another type of bistable device is disclosed in U.S. Pat. No. 6,239,685 to Albrecht, et al., (Albrecht). Albrecht discloses a beam consisting of two different materials, having different coefficients of thermal expansion which span an area between two anchor points.  is a schematic diagram illustrating a multi-material bistable device. Bistable device  comprises beam  spanning between anchor points  and . The beam is constructed of materials A and B having different coefficients of thermal expansion. In operation, as thermal energy is applied to material A, the bistable device will enter the first stable state. Conversely, when thermal energy is applied to material B, the bistable device will enter the second stable state, as shown in .","Another type of bistable device is disclosed in U.S. Pat. No. 5,867,302 to Fleming (Fleming). Fleming discloses a bistable device comprising a beam anchored by at least three anchors in which the beam forms a curvilinear cross-sectional shape, with the anchor points at the ends and the midpoint.  is a schematic diagram illustrating a bistable device configured in a curvilinear cross-section. Bistable device  comprises beam , which is stressed under compression while secured at anchors \u2013. The stressing of beam  creates the two equilibrium states of the device. By applying electrostatic energy to beam , the orientation will change to the second equilibrium state, as shown in , which is described in Fleming as having mirror-image symmetry.","Still another type of bistable device is disclosed in the article, A Centrally-Clamped Parallel-Beam Bistable MEMS Mechanism, by Jin Qiu, et al.  is a schematic view of the centrally-clamped parallel-beam bistable device. Bistable device  comprises beams  and  anchored at each end and connected to one another through central connection . The different feature of centrally-clamped bistable device  is that there are no internal stresses present in beams  and\/or  in the equilibrium state. Thus, centrally-clamped bistable device  has its two steady-state positions simply due to its geometry and central connection. As energy is applied to bistable device  it deflects and deforms until reaching the snap-through point, at which time device  continues to the second equilibrium position, as shown in , without any further actuation force or energy.","Many other types or variations of the above-described types of bistable devices have been well-documented and used extensively as switches, actuators, relays, and the like. However, each of the above-described variations are anchored to the substrate (i.e., not released into a free-moving device). Additionally each of the above-described devices makes use of both equilibrium states in its operations. In the switch, the device flips from the first steady-state position into the second to actuate and \u201cdeactuate\u201d the controlled system. Contacts or relays are often included in such devices to supply the electric switching effects. Through this state-to-state transitioning, energy is applied and expended, but not stored because the energy that is used when the bistable device is deflected up to the snap-through point will be returned by the energy released in moving to the second equilibrium state after snap-through.","Bistable device  () comprises a centrally-clamped device.  is a graph illustrating the force necessary to transition bistable device  from one equilibrium state to the other as a function of deflection distance. At point , almost no force is required to begin device  moving. However, the necessary force continues to increase until peak force  is reached. This is the point in the deflection that requires the strongest amount of force to move device . After peak force  is reached, less force is typically required to move device  towards snap-through point . At snap-through point , device  essentially snaps itself into the second bistable position by releasing any and all of the energy that had been stored or built up in the system prior to snap-through point .","It should be noted that the transition force curve, as shown in , may take many different shapes depending on the specific design of the bistable device. For example, the force displacement curve does not have to be symmetric, nor does the potential energy versus displacement curve need to be symmetric as shown.","It should further be noted that many different types of force may be used to pre-charge or load the multi-stable elements of the present invention. For example, thermal energy, electrostatic energy, magnetic energy, and mechanical energy may be applied to the multi-stable element in order to drive the element toward any one of its multiple, equilibrium states. Additionally, surface tension forces may also be used to pre-charge or load the multi-stable elements.",{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0041","num":"0040"},"figref":["FIG. 7B","FIG. 7A","FIGS. 7A and 7B"],"b":"702"},{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0042","num":"0041"},"figref":["FIG. 8","FIG. 7A"],"b":["80","800","801","802","80","803","804","805","80","806","806","803","803","803","702","803","702","804","805"]},{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0043","num":"0042"},"figref":"FIG. 9","b":["80","800","80","803","900","803","806","803","80","800","801"]},{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0044","num":"0043"},"figref":["FIG. 10A","FIG. 9","FIG. 10B","FIG. 10B"],"b":["80","1000","1001","80","1000","1001","80","1000","80","80","1000","804","805","1002","1003"]},"The present invention has many potential uses for pre-loading sub-millimeter devices such as grippers, semi-active receptacles, mechanical connectors, linking apparatuses, and the like.
