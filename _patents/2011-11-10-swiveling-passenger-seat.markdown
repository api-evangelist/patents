No. 61\/456,679, filed on Nov. 10, 2010, entitled SWIVELLING AIRCRAFT SEAT, U.S. Provisional Application Ser. No. 61\/456,675, filed on Nov. 10, 2010, entitled MULTIBENDABLE SEAT, and U.S. Provisional Application Ser. No. 61\/456,673, filed on Nov. 10, 2010, entitled ROTATING HEAD REST. The '679, '675, and '673 applications are hereby incorporated herein in their entireties by this reference.","The invention relates to passenger seats or the like.","Common carriers, such as passenger airlines, bus lines, train lines, and passenger vehicles frequently include many passenger seats within a passenger cabin for transporting numerous passengers simultaneously. In many cases, to improve passenger comfort, the passenger seats include reclining seat backs that are adjustable by the passengers. The reclining seat backs often include many linkages, parts, and equipment. The number of components required increases the cost of maintenance, the weight of the seat, and the likelihood of seat failure.","Many of these common carriers also provide beverages and\/or snacks to passengers during transport. Because passengers are discouraged from moving about the passenger cabin during transport, the beverages and\/or snacks are brought to the passengers by common carrier attendants. In passenger cabins with large numbers of passengers or in the case of hazardous travel conditions or other circumstances, some or all of the passengers may not receive beverage and\/or snack service during transport. Because many passengers consider these services to be amenities purchased as part of the transportation fare, not providing these services may lead to disgruntled passengers and loss of business.","Thus, it may be desirable to provide passenger seats with adjustable reclining functions that allow passengers to adjust the seats to a desired position, while minimizing the number of components required, as well as providing a way for passengers to access beverages and\/or snacks during transport without the need to rely on delivery by custom carrier attendants.","Embodiments of the present invention include a passenger seat assembly comprising a seat back support, a seat pan coupled to the seat back support, a seat support structure coupled to the seat pan, wherein the seat support structure comprises a mounting channel, and a mounting bar inserted through the mounting channel and coupled to the seat support structure. The mounting bar may be configured to pivotally couple to a passenger cabin, which may include at least one of a side structure and a lower structure of the passenger cabin. The mounting bar may also be configured to rotate the passenger seat assembly between an upright position and a reclined position.","According to certain embodiments, at least one compartment may be coupled to at least one end of the mounting bar. The compartment may be configured to stow at least one of beverages and snacks, and may include a payment processing device that is configured to control access to the compartment.","In other embodiments, the passenger seat assembly may also include a headrest comprising a horizontal track positioned in a curved rear surface of a headrest, a vertical track coupled to a seat back support, and a structure coupled to the horizontal track and the vertical track and configured to overlap at least a portion of the headrest, wherein the headrest is configured to horizontally rotate relative to the structure, and the structure is configured to vertically travel along the track. The headrest may also be configured to pivot from an upright position to a reclined position relative to the seat back support.","In certain other embodiments, the passenger seat assembly may include a plurality of seat support structures, each having a mounting channel, and a mounting bar with a plurality of sections. Each section may be inserted through the mounting channel, coupled to one of the seat support structures, and may be configured to rotate independently of the other sections.","The described embodiments of the invention provide passenger seat assemblies with a swivel design. While the passenger seat assemblies are discussed for use with aircraft seats, they are by no means so limited. Rather, embodiments of the passenger seat assemblies may be used in passenger seats or other seats of any type or otherwise as desired.",{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0034","num":"0033"},"figref":["FIGS. 1-22","FIGS. 1"],"b":["10","10","12","14","16","12","14","16","3","9","10","13","15","21","18","12","14"]},"In certain embodiments, the seat pan  is integrally formed with the seat back support  so that the seat back support  remains at a fixed angle relative to the seat pan .

In these embodiments, the mounting bar  may be pivotally coupled to the lower structure  of the passenger cabin  for additional structural stability and support as needed. The pivotal coupling between one or both ends  of the mounting bar  and the lower structure  may include any suitable fastening mechanism including but not limited to bolts, rivets, welding, or other suitable mechanisms that allow the end(s)  to rotate relative to the lower structure . In some embodiments, an extension may be used to pivotally couple the mounting bar  to the lower structure .","To recline the passenger seat assembly , a passenger actuates a switch , which causes the mounting bar  to rotate relative to its mounting location (the side structure  or the lower structure  of the passenger cabin ). In some embodiments, a rotational controller  is operated by the switch  on the passenger seat assembly . The mounting bar  may be coupled to the rotational controller  adjacent the mounting location or other suitable location. One of ordinary skill in the relevant art will understand that examples of suitable rotational controllers may include but are not limited to motors, drivers, gas locks, spring-loaded devices, or other suitable devices that may apply a rotational force to the mounting bar , while also preventing rotation of the mounting bar  when the switch  is disengaged.","When the passenger actuates the switch  in a reclining direction, the switch  directs the rotational controller  to rotate the mounting bar  in a reclining direction. The reclining rotation of the mounting bar  stops when the passenger releases the switch  or when the mounting bar  has been rotated the full amount allowed by the rotational controller  in the reclining direction. , , , and  illustrate the passenger seat assemblies  in various reclining positions. Conversely, when the passenger actuates the switch  in an upright direction, the switch  directs the rotational controller  to rotate the mounting bar  in an upright direction. The upright rotation of the mounting bar  stops when the passenger releases the switch  or when the mounting bar  has been rotated the full amount allowed by the rotational controller  in the upright direction.","According to certain embodiments, as shown in , , , , and , a plurality of passenger seat assemblies  may be mounted to the mounting bar . In these embodiments, as best shown in , the mounting bar  may include a plurality of sections  that rotate independently of one another. For example, the plurality of sections  may be nested so that each section  is coupled to at least one rotational controller .

A pair of outer sections  may be configured to overlap a portion of each end  of the inner section . One or both outer sections  is pivotally coupled to the mounting location adjacent one or both ends  of the mounting bar . Each outer section  may be coupled to a separate rotational controller  adjacent the mounting location or other suitable location. Thus, in this arrangement, the center passenger seat assembly  is mounted to the inner section , which in turn provides the reclining motion of the center passenger seat assembly . The passenger seat assembly  located adjacent each end  of the mounting bar  may be coupled to the outer section  adjacent that location. Each outer section  provides the reclining motion of the passenger seat assembly  to which it is coupled. As a result, the reclining\/upright rotation of each passenger seat assembly  may be controlled independently of the reclining\/upright rotation of the other passenger seat assemblies  coupled to the same mounting bar .","In some embodiments, as shown in , -, , and -, at least one compartment  may be positioned adjacent one or both sides  of the seat support structure . In some embodiments, the compartment  may provide additional stowage locations for the passenger seated in the passenger seat assembly . In other embodiments, as shown in FIGS.  and -, the compartment  may be configured to stow at least one of beverages and snacks that a passenger may access by opening a lid .

When a passenger wishes to use the reclining headrest D, the passenger lowers the extension column  into a retracted position (as shown in ), wherein the reclined headrest D is adjacent a back of the passenger's head and\/or neck. If passenger does not wish to recline his or her head against the reclined headrest D, the passenger raises the extension column  into an extended position (as shown in ), wherein the reclined headrest D is adjacent or above a top of the passenger's head. In the extended position, the passenger's head may rest against the extension column . As illustrated in , the headrest D may be coupled to any suitable type of passenger seat assembly A.","In certain other embodiments, as shown in , a headrest E may be coupled to the seat back support . In these embodiments, the headrest E has a curved rear surface  that includes a horizontal track . In some embodiments, a portion of a structure  may be inserted within the horizontal track  so that the headrest E is rotatably coupled to the structure .","In these embodiments, the headrest E may horizontally rotate along the horizontal track  relative to the structure  so that a passenger may adjust the amount of support available on either side of the passenger's head by rotating the headrest E to the side of the passenger's head where additional support is desired.","The structure  may be pivotally coupled to at least one vertical track  in a manner that allows the headrest E to pivot from an upright position to a reclined position relative to the upper edge  of the seat back support .","In some embodiments, the structure  may be mounted to the vertical track  in a fixed vertical location. Thus, the vertical track \/structure  coupling may be configured to maintain the headrest E in a stationary vertical position relative to the upper edge .","In other embodiments, as shown in , the vertical track \/structure  coupling may be configured to allow the headrest E to vertically translate relative to the upper edge . For example, the vertical track  may form an end of the extension column  (as more clearly shown in ). Thus, the extension column  may be raised or lowered as needed to adjust the vertical position of the headrest E. In certain other embodiments, the structure  may be coupled to the vertical track  in a manner that allows the structure  to travel along the vertical track  as needed to adjust the vertical position of the headrest E.","Thus, the headrest E may have at least three different adjustment options in certain embodiments: side to side rotation, vertical movement, and reclined\/upright pivot.","In certain other embodiments, as illustrated in , a headrest support structure  may be positioned aft of the vertical track , the structure , and the headrest E. In these embodiments, the headrest support structure  may be shaped to have a width that corresponds to the width of the seat back support  and a height that corresponds to the height of the headrest E. In certain embodiments, as shown in , the headrest support structure  may be fixedly coupled to the seat back support  adjacent the upper edge . In other embodiments, the headrest support structure  may be integrally formed with the seat back support  so that the headrest support structure  remains at a fixed position relative to the seat back support . In yet other embodiments, the headrest support structure  may be pivotally coupled to the upper edge .","In certain embodiments, as shown in , the structure  may be configured to overlap at least a portion of the headrest E so that the headrest E is configured to horizontally travel through a channel within the structure . The structure  may be positioned adjacent the center of the headrest support structure  and configured to support a passenger's head. Thus, in these embodiments, the headrest E may be horizontally adjusted by the passenger without disturbing the passenger's head that may be resting on the structure . As illustrated in , the headrest E may be coupled to any suitable type of passenger seat assembly A.","The foregoing is provided for purposes of illustrating, explaining, and describing embodiments of the present invention.
