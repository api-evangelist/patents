{"@attributes":{"id":"description"},"BRFSUM":[{},{}],"heading":["TECHNICAL FIELD","BACKGROUND","SUMMARY","DETAILED DESCRIPTION"],"p":["Embodiment of the invention relate to the filed of communication routing.","Tracking down the location of an individual within a large enterprise such as a hospital, manufacturing unit or globally distributed organization is typically a difficult task. For instance, in a hospital, should there be an emergency it would be essential to ascertain the location of a particular doctor and contact the doctor on an immediate basis, as quickly as possible. Again, in manufacturing units or globally distributed organizations, there is a need and the ability to locate an individual quickly increases productivity.","For example, an individual within an organisation may be contacted using a telephone contact number. However, should that individual be away from the desk or specified location, it may not be possible to contact that individual telephonically. Now-a-days, mobile phones are useful for contacting individuals who is on the move, but again unfortunately not everyone carries a mobile phone.","Furthermore, another easy way to contact individuals within an organisation is via an instant messaging client. Should that individual be away from his desk, the instant messaging client is typically configured to reflect the status of the individual as being \u2018away\u2019 but provides no further indication of the individual's location, unless the user specifies where they may be available depending on the current program conditions, which may not be the specified location to find the user as these conditions are subject to change dynamically.","A need therefore exists, for a location tracking system to substantially overcome, or at least ameliorate, one or more disadvantages of existing arrangements.","According to a first aspect thereof, is provided a method for routing communication to an individual. The method comprises the steps of receiving access control information for the individual, identifying the current location of the individual from the access control information, receiving communication for the individual and routing the communication to the current location of the individual.","According to further aspect, there is provided a system for routing communication to an individual. The system comprises a location tracking server, the location tracking server is configured to receive access control information. The system also comprises a communication server; the communication server is configured to receive communication for the individual. The location tracking server converts the access control information into the current location of the individual. The communication server receives the current location of the individual and routes the communication for the individual to the current location of the individual.","As will be appreciated by one skilled in the art, the disclosure may be embodied as a system, method or computer program product. Accordingly, the disclosure may take the form of an entirely hardware embodiment, an entirely software embodiment (including firmware, resident software, micro-code, etc.) or an embodiment combining software and hardware aspects that may all generally be referred to herein as a \u201ccircuit,\u201d \u201cmodule\u201d or \u201csystem.\u201d Furthermore, embodiments of the invention may take the form of a computer program product embodied in any tangible medium of expression having computer usable program code embodied in the medium.","Any combination of one or more computer usable or computer readable medium(s) may be utilized. The computer-usable or computer-readable medium may be, for example but not limited to, an electronic, magnetic, optical, electromagnetic, infrared, or semiconductor system, apparatus, device, or propagation medium. More specific examples (a non-exhaustive list) of the computer-readable medium would include the following: an electrical connection having one or more wires, a portable computer diskette, a hard disk, a random access memory (RAM), a read-only memory (ROM), an erasable programmable read-only memory (EPROM or Flash memory), an optical fiber, a portable compact disc read-only memory (CDROM), an optical storage device, a transmission media such as those supporting the Internet or an intranet, or a magnetic storage device. Note that the computer-usable or computer-readable medium could even be paper or another suitable medium, upon which the program is printed, as the program can be electronically captured, via, for instance, optical scanning of the paper or other medium, then compiled, interpreted, or otherwise processed in a suitable manner, if necessary, and then stored in a computer memory. In the context of this document, a computer-usable or computer-readable medium may be any medium that can contain, store, communicate, propagate, or transport the program for use by or in connection with the instruction execution system, apparatus, or device. The computer-usable medium may include a propagated data signal with the computer-usable program code embodied therewith, either in baseband or as part of a carrier wave. The computer usable program code may be transmitted using any appropriate medium, including but not limited to wireless, wireline, optical fiber cable, RF, etc.","Computer program code for carrying out operations of the present invention may be written in any combination of one or more programming languages, including an object oriented programming language such as Java\u00ae, Smalltalk, C++ or the like and conventional procedural programming languages, such as the \u201cC\u201d programming language or similar programming languages. The program code may execute entirely on the user's computer, partly on the user's computer, as a stand-alone software package, partly on the user's computer or data processing system and partly on a remote computer or entirely on the remote computer or server. In the latter scenario, the remote computer may be connected to the user's computer through any type of network, including a local area network (LAN) or a wide area network (WAN), or the connection may be made to an external computer (for example, through the Internet using an Internet Service Provider).","Embodiments of the invention is described below with reference to flowchart illustrations and\/or block diagrams of methods, apparatus (systems) and computer program products according to embodiments of the invention. It will be understood that each block of the flowchart illustrations and\/or block diagrams, and combinations of blocks in the flowchart illustrations and\/or block diagrams, can be implemented by computer program instructions. These computer program instructions may be provided to a processor of a general purpose computer, special purpose computer, or other programmable data processing apparatus to produce a machine, such that the instructions, which execute via the processor of the computer or other programmable data processing apparatus, create means for implementing the functions\/acts specified in the flowchart and\/or block diagram block or blocks. These computer program instructions may also be stored in a computer-readable medium that can direct a computer or other programmable data processing apparatus to function in a particular manner, such that the instructions stored in the computer-readable medium produce an article of manufacture including instruction means which implement the function\/act specified in the flowchart and\/or block diagram block or blocks.","The computer program instructions may also be loaded onto a computer or other programmable data processing apparatus to cause a series of operational steps to be performed on the computer or other programmable apparatus to produce a computer implemented process such that the instructions which execute on the computer or other programmable apparatus provide processes for implementing the functions\/acts specified in the flowchart and\/or block diagram block or blocks.",{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0020","num":"0019"},"figref":"FIG. 1","b":["100","100","110","120","120","110","130","130","140","140","140","150"]},{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0021","num":"0020"},"figref":"FIG. 2","b":["200","200","210","140","140","130","110","120","200","220","220","140","150","220","210","220","210","220","210","220","210"]},"The location tracking server  is able to ascertain the locations of individuals within the access control system . For example, should individual with individualID #001 enter a location with locationID #AAA, and this information will be reflected in the access control server . The location tracking server  is then able to receive the information that individual #001 has entered located #AAA. The location tracking server  may be connected to a database  which contains lookup tables for converting the individualID into the identity of the individual and the locationID into the location of the individual. For example, the location tracking server is able to translate individualID #001 into Joe Soap and resolve the locationID #AAA into Operating Ward  with telephone number 740 6559. In another example, the location tracking server  may receive information that an individual with individualID #002 has entered a location with locationID #AAB and infer using the look up information in the database  that Joe Blogs has entered the canteen.","The location tracking server  may contain an API  for making the location tracking information available. The system , may contain a plurality of communication servers . An example of a communication server may be a soft phone system by CISCO\u2122 Systems or an instant messaging server by Microsoft\u2122 Corporation. The location tracking server API  may be implemented by Web Services or Microsoft\u2122.Net Remoting. In this manner, when an individual changes his location, the communication servers may be updated to reflect the new location of the individual. For example, the soft phone system may automatically update the telephone number for an individual when the individual changes location. This way, a telephone call to the individual will be redirected to the phone closest to his location. Similarly, the instant messaging server  may update the plurality of instant messaging clients to reflect the current location of the individual. Therefore, instead of the status of an individual in an instant messaging client simply reflecting \u2018away\u2019, the instant messaging client may reflect for example \u2018in the canteen\u2019.",{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0024","num":"0023"},"figref":"FIG. 3","b":["300","300","310","120","120"]},"At step , the individualID is sent to the access control panel . Additionally, the locationID is sent to the access control panel . The locationID is identifies the location of the access control device . At step , the individualID and locationID are sent to the access control server  in the access control computer  via the access control board . At step , the individualID and locationID are sent to the location tracking server  executing on the access control computer . The location tracking server  may obtain the individualID and locationID information from the access control server  as a result of a polling request or as a response to a location update event. The location tracking server  reads information contained in the database  to translate the individualID into the identity of the individual. For example, the database  may contain a database table where individualID is a primary index and a number of columns exist to contain individual information such as first name and last name of the individual. Additionally, the location tracking server  uses the database  to translate the locationID into the location of the individual. Similarly, the database  may contain a database table with the locationID as the primary index and a number of columns exist to contain the location information such as the name of the location, and the telephone number of a telephone within that location.","Once the location tracking server  has resolved the individual information and location information, it makes the information available via its API . At step , a communication server  reads the individual information and location information from the location tracking server API . The communication server may poll the API  on a continual basis or receive a location update event from the API .","Once the communication server has received the location tracking update information it may configure the contact information applicable to the relevant individual. For example, the telephone contact information for an individual may be automatically updated to the telephone number of the telephone closest to the individual.","The communication server may notify one or more communication clients to indicate the current location of the individual. For example, where the communication server is a soft phone implementation, one or more telephone handsets could display the current location of the individual on an LCD display device of the telephone handset.","Similarly, the instant messaging server may notify one or more instant messaging clients with the name of the individual's location.","At step , the communication server may route communication for an individual according to the location of the individual. For example, where the communication server is a softphone implementation, the communication server may be configured to route a telephone call to a telephone handset closest to the individual. If the individual is not near a handset, the communication server may be configured to play back an appropriate message informing the caller that the individual is not near a handset.","Where the communication server is an Instant Messaging Server, the communication server may be configured to convert a text message communication for the individual into speech. The speech may then be directed to a telephone handset or speaker at the current location of the individual for playback. Alternatively, the text message may be converted into Short Message Service (SMS) format and sent to the individual's mobile phone.",{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0032","num":"0031"},"figref":"FIG. 4","b":["400","400","250","420","220","410","410"]},"The location tracking server may be implemented as software, such as one or more application programs executable within the computer system or data processing system , such as that illustrated in an exemplary embodiment in . For example, such computer system comprise a desktop computer, a laptop computer, a server, a pocket PC, a PDA, a mobile phone etc. Furthermore the instant messaging client may be implemented as software such as one or more application programs executable within the computer system . The instructions may be formed as one or more code modules, each for performing one or more particular tasks. The software may be stored in a computer readable medium, including the storage devices described below, for example. The software is loaded into the computer system  from the computer readable medium, and then executed by the computer system . A computer readable medium having such software or computer program recorded on it is a computer program product.","As seen in , the computer system  is formed by a computer module , input devices such as a keyboard  and a mouse pointer device , and output devices including a printer , a display device  and loudspeakers . An external Modulator-Demodulator (Modem) transceiver device  may be used by the computer module  for communicating to and from a communications network  via a connection . Such a communication network, may be a wired network, a wireless network or a combination thereof. The network  may be a wide-area network (WAN), such as the Internet or a private WAN. Where the connection  is a telephone line, the modem  may be a traditional \u201cdial-up\u201d modem. Alternatively, where the connection  is a high capacity (eg: cable) connection, the modem  may be a broadband modem. A wireless modem may also be used for wireless connection to the network .","The computer module  typically includes at least one processor unit , and a memory unit  for example formed from semiconductor random access memory (RAM) and read only memory (ROM). The module  also includes an number of input\/output (I\/O) interfaces including an audio-video interface  that couples to the video display  and loudspeakers , an I\/O interface  for the keyboard  and mouse  and optionally a joystick (not illustrated), and an interface  for the external modem  and printer . In some implementations, the modem  may be incorporated within the computer module , for example within the interface . The computer module  also has a local network interface  which, via a connection , permits coupling of the computer system  to a local computer network , known as a Local Area Network (LAN). As also illustrated, the local network  may also couple to the wide network  via a connection , which would typically include a so-called \u201cfirewall\u201d device or similar functionality. The interface  may be formed by an Ethernet\u2122 circuit card, a wireless Bluetooth\u2122 or an IEEE 802.11 wireless arrangement.","The interfaces  and  may afford both serial and parallel connectivity, the former typically being implemented of the Universal Serial Bus (USB) standards and having corresponding USB connectors (not illustrated). Storage devices  are provided and typically include a hard disk drive (HDD) . Other devices such as a floppy disk drive and a magnetic tape drive (not illustrated) may also be used. An optical disk drive  is typically provided to act as a non-volatile source of data. Portable memory devices, such optical disks (eg: CD-ROM, DVD), USB-RAM, and floppy disks for example may then be used as appropriate sources of data to the system .","The components  to  of the computer module  typically communicate via an interconnected bus  and in a manner which results in a conventional mode of operation of the computer system  known to those in the relevant art. Examples of computers on which the described arrangements can be practiced include IBM-PC's and compatibles, Sun Sparcstations, Apple Mac\u2122 or like computer systems evolved therefrom.","Typically, the application programs discussed above are resident on the hard disk drive  and read and controlled in execution by the processor . Intermediate storage of such programs and any data fetched from the networks  and  may be accomplished using the semiconductor memory , possibly in concert with the hard disk drive . In some instances, the application programs may be supplied to the user encoded on one or more CD-ROM and read via the corresponding drive , or alternatively may be read by the user from the networks  or . Still further, the software can also be loaded into the computer system  from other computer readable media. Computer readable media refers to any storage medium that participates in providing instructions and\/or data to the computer system  for execution and\/or processing. Examples of such media include floppy disks, magnetic tape, CD-ROM, a hard disk drive, a ROM or integrated circuit, a magneto-optical disk, or a computer readable card such as a PCMCIA card and the like, whether or not such devices are internal or external of the computer module . Examples of computer readable transmission media that may also participate in the provision of instructions and\/or data include radio or infra-red transmission channels as well as a network connection to another computer or networked device, and the Internet or Intranets including e-mail transmissions and information recorded on Websites and the like.","The second part of the application programs and the corresponding code modules mentioned above may be executed to implement one or more graphical user interfaces (GUIs) to be rendered or otherwise represented upon the display . Through manipulation of the keyboard  and the mouse , a user of the computer system  and the application may manipulate the interface to provide controlling commands and\/or input to the applications associated with the GUI(s).","Method  may alternatively be implemented in dedicated hardware such as one or more integrated circuits performing the functions or sub functions of .
