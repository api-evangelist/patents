This type of reaction involves the transfer of electrons from one material to another through an electric circuit.","The battery cell comprises three major components: anode or negative electrode; cathode or positive electrode; and the electrolyte. The anode or negative electrode, the reducing or fuel electrode, gives up electrons to the external circuit and is oxidized during the electrochemical reaction. The cathode or positive electrode, the oxidizing electrode, accepts electrons from the external circuit and is reduced during the electrochemical reaction. The electrolyte, the ionic conductor, provides the medium for transfer of electrons as ions, inside the cell between the anode and cathode. The electrolyte is typically a liquid, such as water or other solvent, with dissolved salts, acids, or alkalis to impart ionic conductivity. Some batteries use solid electrolytes, which are ionic conductors at the operating temperature of a cell.","In conventional systems, a battery stores energy by employing a reducing agent (e.g., lead) as an anode or negative electrode and an oxidizing agent (e.g., lead dioxide) as the cathode or positive electrode. An electrolytic solution (e.g., sulfuric acid in water) is used between the electrodes. When energy is withdrawn, the reducing agent (e.g., lead) gives up electrons which flow through an external circuit and are received by the oxidizing agent (e.g., lead dioxide) at the positive electrode. Ions (e.g., hydrogen ions and sulfate ions) flow through the electrolytic solution between the electrodes to complete the circuit. Some type of chemical compound (e.g., lead sulfate) is produced as a result of the combination of these processes. The product or discharge compounds are stored usually in a porous structure of one or both of the electrodes.","Energy-storing systems (e.g., primary batteries) are designed to provide maximum energy storage per unit weight of the battery. In other words, these batteries must have a high energy. Other design considerations involve the life of the battery, its cost and, of course, the operating efficiency. Usually, there is some sort of trade-off between these desirable characteristics.","Li\u2014CFbatteries are used in applications where a high specific energy primary power source is needed. See, T. Tan, P. Lam, H. Tsukamoto, M. Hendrickson and E. Plichta, p. 73, 42Philadelphia, Pa., June 2006 and S. V. Sazhin, K. Ramaswami, T. J. Gurrie, C. R. Niendorf, and A. Suszko, p. 61, 42Philadelphia, Pa., June 2006.","Li\u2014CFcells have one of the highest practical specific energies of any solid cathode primary battery system, See J. L. Wood, R. B. Badachhape, R. J. Lagow, J. L. Margrave, 73(9), 3139 (1969); N. Watanabe, Kyoto, M Fukuda, U.S. Pat. No. 3,536,532. Li\u2014Ocells have a theoretical specific energy even higher than Li\u2014CFcells but a practical specific energy somewhat lower due to cell construction considerations, See, K. M. Abraham and Z. Jiang, 143, 1 (1996); U.S. Pat. No. 5,510,209 (1996). The construction of an electrochemical cell that takes advantage of both the Li\u2014CFchemistry and the Li\u2014Ochemistry has not been described or demonstrated before.","In view of the foregoing, an embodiment herein provides a sealably-enclosed storage lithium carbon monofluoride-oxygen battery system comprising a lithium metal-containing electroactive anode; an electroactive cathode formed of a carbon monofluoride compound; an electrolyte solution formed of a organic solvent and a lithium salt; a casing surrounding the anode, the cathode, and the electrolyte solution; and a port through the casing, wherein the port controllably allows the flow of an oxygen containing gas into the casing.","Embodiments of such a system further comprise a valve that controls the flow of a gas through the port. Furthermore, the gas comprises an oxygen containing gas including oxygen itself. Moreover, such a system further comprises a removable covering that prevents the flow of a gas through the port. In addition, such a system, in another embodiment, further comprises a microporous separator that separates the anode from the cathode. Additionally, in a further embodiment, the microporous separator comprises at least one of polypropylene, polyethylene, glass, and other compositions of matter insoluble in the electrolyte.","The unique feature of this invention is the creation of a product through the discharge of a specific cathode material that then acts as a site for the electrochemical reduction of another electroactive species. In this case, the discharge of a CFx active material produces a carbon byproduct that is then the site for the electrochemical reduction of oxygen and the deposition of LiOand LiO discharge product onto that carbon material. This combination of cell chemistries results in a specific energy for the total cell being higher than for either chemistry by itself.","In such a system, the lithium salt is any of LiCl, LiBr, LiI, LiClO, LiBF, LiPF, LiAsF, LiCHCO, LiCFCO, LiCHSO, LiCFSO, Li(CFSO)N, LiB(CH), LiB(CO), LiB(CO)F, LiB(OCHCO)F, LiSCN, LiNO, and LiBF.

Furthermore, in alternate embodiments, the electrolyte comprises a polymer and forms a gel with the above solvents. Moreover, the polymer comprises any of polyacrylonitrile, polyacrylonitrile methyl acrylate copolymers, polyethylene oxide, polyvinyldene fluoride, and polyimides.","In addition, the cathode in such a system comprises a fluorination of at least one of graphite, coke, carbon black, acetylene black, carbon fibers, carbon nanotubes, charcoal, and other carbon powders. Furthermore, in those embodiments, the cathode comprises fluorinated carbon CFmixed with a conductive carbon and binder, where 0<x<1.2. Moreover, the anode comprises at least one of a lithium metal and a lithium metal alloy. Additionally, the cathode comprise 60% CFactive material, 35% carbon, and 5% polytetrafluoroethylene (e.g. Teflon\u00ae) binder, where 0<x<1.2, and the electrolyte may comprise 1 M LiBFin PC\/DME 1:1.","Another embodiment herein provides an apparatus comprising an electrochemical battery cell containing a metal-containing electroactive anode; an electroactive cathode formed of a carbon and a lithium fluoride compound; and an electrolyte solution formed of a solvent and a lithium salt; an electrochemical battery casing encasing the electrochemical battery cell; a port bored through the electrochemical battery casing to the cathode of the electrochemical battery cell; and a gas control mechanism operatively coupled to the port and comprising an open configuration and a closed configuration, wherein the gas control mechanism selectively allows the flow of gas into the electrochemical battery cell.","In such an apparatus, when the valve is in the open configuration, the cathode of the electrochemical battery cell is exposed to an oxygen containing gas, and when the valve is in the closed configuration, the cathode of the electrochemical battery cell is isolated from the oxygen containing gas. In addition, the gas comprises oxygen. Moreover, the lithium salt comprises any of LiCl, LiBr, LiI, LiClO, LiBF, LiPF, LiAsF, LiCHCO, LiCFCO, LiCHSO, LiCFSO, Li(CFSO)N, LiB(CH), LiB(CO), LiB(CO)F, LiB(OCHCO)F, LiSCN, LiNO, and LiBF.

The method further comprises closing the valve of the battery to block the flow of gas into the battery; discharging the battery after closing the valve; opening the valve after discharging the battery to expose the cathode to the flow of gas; and discharging the battery after opening the valve.","These and other aspects of the embodiments herein will be better appreciated and understood when considered in conjunction with the following description and the accompanying drawings. It should be understood, however, that the following descriptions, while indicating preferred embodiments and numerous specific details thereof, are given by way of illustration and not of limitation. Many changes and modifications may be made within the scope of the embodiments herein without departing from the spirit thereof, and the embodiments herein include all such modifications.","The embodiments herein and the various features and advantageous details thereof are explained more fully with reference to the non-limiting embodiments that are illustrated in the accompanying drawings and detailed in the following description. Descriptions of well-known components and processing techniques are omitted so as to not unnecessarily obscure the embodiments herein. The examples used herein are intended merely to facilitate an understanding of ways in which the embodiments herein may be practiced and to further enable those of skill in the art to practice the embodiments herein. Accordingly, the examples should not be construed as limiting the scope of the embodiments herein.","The need to supply portable electric power has brought the development of lithium batteries that can provide the most energy for the least weight and volume. Two of the highest energy density electrochemical couples are the lithium-carbon monofluoride battery and the lithium-oxygen battery. The lithium-carbon monofluoride battery has a very high theoretical energy density of 3200 Wh\/kg and excellent shelf life and storage characteristics. The lithium-oxygen battery has an even higher specific energy than the lithium-carbon mono-fluoride battery but because of poor storage and shelf-life characteristics from the migration of corrosive moisture and oxygen to the lithium anode, the lithium-oxygen battery still has not been developed for commercial application.","The embodiments herein provide a battery with more energy than a lithium-carbon monofluoride battery, approaching that of a lithium-oxygen battery, while retaining the excellent initial storage characteristics of a lithium-carbon monofluoride battery. Referring now to the drawings, and more particularly to , where similar reference characters denote corresponding features consistently throughout the figures, there are shown preferred embodiments.",{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0029","num":"0028"},"figref":"FIG. 1","b":["1","1","10","15","20","25","30","1","5","5","1"]},"In , anode  is a negative electrode and includes a lithium metal or a lithium metal alloy. In addition, electrolyte  includes a soluble lithium salt dissolved in an organic solvent. Furthermore, cathode  is a porous positive electrode and includes a fluorinated carbon CF(where 0<x<1.2), mixed with a conductive carbon and binder.","Electrochemical battery  also includes port , which is selectively opened to expose cathode  to the oxygen containing gas . Gas  includes a gas selected from the group of oxygen gas, air, or other oxygen and gas mixtures. In one embodiment, gas  is provided by a pressurized gas cylinder  where the gas is oxygen, air or other oxygen\/gas mixture or by the ambient air environment. In one embodiment, gas  is pure oxygen.","In addition, a control mechanism  is coupled to the port . The control mechanism is configured as a valve that is coupled to port  and used to open or close cathode  to gas  (e.g., oxygen or air). Alternatively, the control mechanism  is configured as tape or other removable covering such that the port  is covered with the tape or removable covering to seal cathode  from gas . Port  is then exposed by removing the tape, or removable covering, to gas  and thereby exposing cathode  to gas .","Moreover, in some embodiments, electrolyte  is a liquid and includes a lithium salt and a solvent. For example, electrolyte  includes lithium salt and the lithium salt is selected from the group consisting of LiCl, LiBr, LiI, LiClO, LiBF, LiPF, LiAsF, LiCHCO, LiCFCO, LiCHSO, LiCFSO, Li(CFSO)N, LiB(CH), LiB(CO), LiB(CO)F, LiB(OCHCO)F, LiSCN, LiNO, and LiBF. In one embodiment, electrolyte  includes LiBF. Furthermore, electrolyte  includes a solvent, and the solvent is selected from the group consisting of N-methylpyrolidinone, N,N-dimethylacetamide, gamma-butyrolactone, methyl ethyl ketone, dimethoxyethane, tetrahydrofuran, dimethylformamide, ethylene carbonate, propylene carbonate, butylene carbonate, vinylene carbonate, dimethyl carbonate, diethyl carbonate, dipropyl carbonate, ethylmethyl carbonate, methylpropyl carbonate, ethylpropyl carbonate, methyl propionate, methyl butyrate, ethyl butyrate and mixtures of these solvents. In another embodiment, electrolyte  includes propylene carbonate and dimethoxyethane mixtures.","Also shown in  is an optional microporous separator . Microporous separator  is made of polypropylene, polyethylene, glass, or other materials insoluble in electrolyte  that are compatible with electrochemical battery  electrodes (e.g., anode  or cathode ). In addition, microporous separator  is used to separate the negative and positive electrodes of electrochemical battery  (e.g., anode  and cathode ) and contain the conductive liquid electrolyte .","Furthermore, electrolyte  optionally forms a gel and operates as a separator. For example, polymers soluble in electrolyte  is used with a liquid organic solvent and a lithium salt to form a gel polymer electrolyte  that separates the positive electrode (e.g., cathode ) and negative electrode (e.g., anode ). Such polymers include polyacrylon nitrile, polyacrylon nitrile methyl acrylate copolymers, polyethylene oxide, polyvinyldene fluoride and polyimides.","Also shown in  is cathode , which, in some alternate embodiments, includes any material made from the fluorination of graphite, coke, carbon black, acetylene black, carbon fibers, carbon nanotubes, charcoal, or other carbon powders. In addition, cathode  is exposed to an atmosphere of oxygen, air or other oxygen and gas mixture through port . For example, a pressurized gas tank (not shown) is used to supply gas  (e.g., oxygen gas) through port  and expose gas  to cathode .","In general, two reactions will occur within electrochemical battery  during discharge; one reaction in the absence of oxygen and another reaction in the presence of oxygen. In the absence of oxygen, the reduction of the fluorinated carbon during discharge occurs according to reaction (1):\n\nLi+CFLiF+C E=3.2V-3.6V\n","In the presence of oxygen, however, another reaction takes places within electrochemical battery  on the surface of the carbon of the cathode  and is described below as reaction (2):\n\n2Li+O\u2192LiO. E=3.10V\n","From the above two reactions, a preferred method of use of electrochemical battery  is to begin discharge with port  closed. With port  closed, electrochemical battery , and specifically cathode , are sealed from gas  (which includes oxygen or air). Thereafter, electrochemical battery  discharges by reduction of CF, according to reaction (1) shown above. Then, when significant amount (e.g., most or all) of the CFhas been reduced according to reaction (1) above, port  opens and exposes electrochemical battery  (e.g., cathode ) to gas  (e.g., oxygen or air). Once exposed to gas , electrochemical battery  begins to discharge by a reduction of gas  (e.g., oxygen) on the carbon formed from reaction (1) according reaction (2).","In addition, electrochemical battery  is used by operating with port  open, and thereby exposing electrochemical battery  to gas  (e.g., oxygen). When operating electrochemical battery  with port  open from the beginning of discharge, the discharge reactions of CFreduction (e.g., reaction (1)) and oxygen reduction (e.g., reaction (2)) occur simultaneously.",{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0041","num":"0040"},"figref":["FIG. 2","FIG. 1","FIG. 2","FIG. 2","FIG. 2"],"b":["1","1","1","25","1","15","1","40","1","30","1","25","35","30","35","1","1","45","1","1","35","30","1","1"],"sub":["x ","x ","4 ","x ","x","x "],"sup":"2 "},{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0042","num":"0041"},"figref":["FIG. 3","FIGS. 1 and 2","FIG. 3","FIG. 3"],"b":["50","1","55","33","1","35","1","60","1","33","1","65","33","1","1","70","1","33","1"]},"The foregoing description of the specific embodiments will so fully reveal the general nature of the embodiments herein that others can, by applying current knowledge, readily modify and\/or adapt for various applications such specific embodiments without departing from the generic concept, and, therefore, such adaptations and modifications should and are intended to be comprehended within the meaning and range of equivalents of the disclosed embodiments.
