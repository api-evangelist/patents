title: Method and arrangement for network resource management
abstract: Method and arrangement for network resource management in a communication network, especially related to transfer of content. A content resource broker is introduced, which dynamically manages resources based on the size of the content to be transferred. The method and arrangement involve the obtaining of information on current and future network capacity, which is available for transfer of content; the receiving of a request from a requesting entity concerning resources for transfer of a content C; and the determining of whether the available network capacity within a predetermined response time is sufficient for transferring the content C before the predetermined response time has expired.

{"@attributes":{"id":"description"},"BRFSUM":[{},{}],"heading":["CROSS REFERENCE TO RELATED APPLICATION","TECHNICAL FIELD","BACKGROUND","SUMMARY","DETAILED DESCRIPTION"],"p":["This application is a 35 U.S.C. \u00a7371 national stage application of PCT International Application No. PCT\/SE2009\/051255, filed on 5 Nov. 2009, the disclosure and content of which is incorporated by reference herein in its entirety. The above-referenced PCT International Application was published in the English language as International Publication No. WO 2011\/056103 A1 on 12 May 2011.","The invention relates to a method and an arrangement in a communication system, in particular to network resource management in a communication network with limited transport capacity.","Today, a large portion of all data traffic is related to transfer of content, such as e.g. music, movies, news, web-pages, etc. When the number of simultaneous transfers of content over a bottleneck in the network is increasing, the throughput for each of the transfer sessions decreases proportionally, since the total capacity shared by all simultaneous sessions over the bottleneck is constant. In principle, there is no maximum limit on the number of simultaneous transfers allowed over a specific resource, e.g. a transmission link.","Typically, TCP (Transmission Control Protocol) is the mechanism used to adjust the transfer rate depending on the load-conditions.","Further, a large part of the content transfers are made through so called file sharing, e.g. using Bit Torrent, which is a P2P (Peer-to-Peer) file sharing communications protocol. The use of file sharing enables large content files to be transferred over the Internet. However, the response time for the delivery of a file, i.e. the time from when the file is requested by a user until the file has reached its destination, could be very long when using file sharing.","Further, content such as web traffic and file transfers are usually transferred using so called \u201cbest effort\u201d. \u201cBest effort\u201d usually describes a network service in which the network does not provide any specific guarantees that data is delivered within a certain time limit, or at all, or that a user is given a certain QoS (Quality of Service) or a certain priority, or a specific minimum bandwidth guarantee. In a best effort network, users obtain an unspecified variable bit rate and delivery time, depending on the current traffic load.","Considering the above, there is still room for improvement regarding resource management in content transfer situations.","It would be desirable to obtain a mechanism for reliable resource management in connection with content transfer. It is an object of the invention to address at least some of the issues outlined above. Further it is an object of the invention to provide a mechanism for resource management, which enables delivery of a requested content in a more predictable way within a predetermined time. These objects may be met by a method and apparatus according to the attached independent claims.","According to one aspect, a content resource broker unit (CRBU) is provided for network resource management in a communication network. The CRBU comprises a resource unit for obtaining information on current and future network capacity, which is available for transfer of content. The CRBU further comprises a receiving unit for receiving a request from a requesting entity, concerning network resources for transfer of a content C; and also comprises a determining unit for determining whether the available network capacity within a predetermined response time is sufficient for transferring the content C before the predetermined response time has expired. The CRBU further comprises a permission unit, which may admit the request if the content C could be transferred before the predetermined response time has expired.","According to another aspect, a method is provided for network resource management in a communication network. The method involves obtaining information on current and future network capacity, which is available for transfer of content. The method further involves receiving a request from a requesting entity concerning resources for transfer of a content C, and also involves determining whether the available network capacity within a predetermined response time is sufficient for transferring the content C before the predetermined response time has expired. A request is admitted if the content C could be transferred before the predetermined response time has expired.","The above method and arrangement may respectively be used to enable network resource management to be based on the volume, or size, of the content to be transferred. This provides a mechanism for improving e.g. QoE for content download over network bottlenecks by enabling avoidance of e.g. interruptions due to throughput scarcity.","The first method and arrangement may be implemented in different embodiments, comprising different combinations of some or all of the following features:","The response time may in some situations be negotiated between the CRBU and the requesting entity if e.g. the CRBU cannot fulfil a transfer within the response time indicated in a request. This feature adds flexibility to the system, and enables functionality where a level of strictness may be set to the response time indicated in a request.","The CRBU may comprise a scheduling unit taking the available network capacity and possibly the time sensitivity of the content C into account when scheduling the content C for transfer within the predetermined response time.","The scheduling unit may further assign a certain part of the available network capacity to the transfer of content C dynamically during the predetermined response time.","In order for the requesting entity to receive information on when to start the content transfer, a response comprising an indication on when the transfer of content C can be started could be sent to the requesting entity if the request is admitted.","The CRBU works with volume of content and response time. Therefore, the CRBU should be able to obtain information on these parameters. The size of the content C, and\/or the maximum response time, within which the content C should be delivered, could be derived from the received request. If one or both of these parameters are not explicitly included in the request, the size of the content C could be derived e.g. from a location where the content C is stored, and\/or the response time could be estimated based on at least one of: content size, content type, user preferences, or user subscription type.","In order to support services, which require a minimum transfer rate, the CRB could also be able to derive a minimum transfer rate from the received request.","A priority level of a received request and\/or a priority level of the content transfer indicated in a request may be taken into account when processing a received request. The priority levels may be indicated in the requests or be set by the CRBU based on at least one of: content size, content type, user preferences, or user subscription type.","The priority levels of already admitted, but not yet fulfilled, requests may be taken into account when obtaining information on current and future network capacity, which is available for transfer of content in the network. This feature enables flexibility by enabling the performance of one or more of the following features:","Admitted, but not yet fulfilled requests may be rejected; scheduled, but not yet fulfilled content transfers may be re-scheduled; and network resources which are pre-allocated to content transfers may be re-allocated, based on priority levels of requests and\/or content transfers, or due to fluctuations in network capacity, e.g. in wireless links.","The features relating to priority enables prioritizing between e.g. different content transfers and different services in a way which renders resource management more efficient.","According to yet another aspect, a second method is provided in a requesting entity, for supporting network resource management in a communication network. The method involves sending a request concerning network resources for transfer of a content C to a content resource broker unit, which is able to manage network resources for transfer of content based on the size of the content to be transferred. The request should indicate the size of the content C and\/or the response time, within which the content C should be delivered.","According to yet another aspect, a requesting entity is provided for supporting network resource management in a communication network. The requesting entity comprises a request unit for sending a request concerning network resources for transfer of a content C to a content resource broker, which is able to manage network resources for transfer of content based on the size of the content to be transferred, where the request indicates the size of the content C and\/or the response time, within which the content C should be delivered.","The above second method and arrangement may be used in order to support the network resource management by providing essential information, such as e.g. the size of the content to be transferred to a content resource broker as the one previously described.","According to another aspect, a computer program product is provided, comprising instructions, which when executed by a processor, or the like, will perform the method according to any of the embodiments described above.","Briefly described, a solution is provided for managing network resources for content transfer in a new and more controllable way in a network with limited transport capacity, by introducing a content resource broker, which can differentiate between different requests and take a predetermined response time into account when assigning network resources. The described resource management architecture can be applied to any traffic classes. The described resource management architecture is based on volumes of data, i.e. it is not based on the traditionally used \u201cbits per second\u201d.","Within this document some expressions will be used, which will be briefly defined here. For example, the term \u201cresponse time\u201d is used as meaning the time from when a certain content has been requested by a user until said content has been delivered to its destination. The expressions \u201climited transport capacity\u201d or \u201cbandwidth limited network\u201d is used to indicate that the network comprises bottlenecks with limited throughput capacity, which limits the passing traffic to a certain degree. In transport networks, it may indicate bandwidth limitations, and in wireless networks, the limitations may also be described by a signal-to-noise ratio. The term \u201ccontent\u201d is used as meaning information and experiences that may provide value for an end-user, for example films, news, video clips, music, games, texts e.g. novels, books, etc. The terms \u201cvolume\u201d or \u201csize\u201d of a content are used as meaning the amount of bits which are needed to represent the content, i.e. the number of bits which needs to be transferred in order to deliver the content to a certain peer or end-user. This volume may be defined to include only the bits representing the actual content e.g. a coded film, or be defined to further include any additional control information which is also typically needed in order to transfer the content through a network.","The expressions \u201cavailable network resources\u201d and \u201cavailable network capacity\u201d refer to resources and capacity which are free and available to be used for a transfer of content. The resources may be non-allocated, but may also be previously allocated to e.g. a transfer of content of lower priority, and therefore be regarded as free and available to a transfer of content of a higher priority.","The links discussed in this document could be so called \u201cvirtual\u201d links, which means that they may comprise several hops or sub-links, which may be wired or wireless.","Different types of content have different requirements on the response time. For example, some types of content are to be consumed rather immediately, e.g. videos from YouTube or web pages, while other types of content are for later use, e.g. file shared full size movies.","These differences in requirements can be exploited by a centralized resource broker, which uses information on the different transfer types and applies different kinds of prioritization mechanisms.","Currently, there are many kinds of resource broker architectures for real-time services, such as speech calls, which provide a CAC-function (Call Admission Control), which denies or admits received requests for resources. These resources are described in bits-per-second. The broker described in this document could also be adapted to support conventional requests for resources from e.g. real-time services, in order to provide an overall resource management service.","In the resource management procedure presented in this document, a new type of network resource broker will be introduced. This new type of network resource broker will be denoted \u201ccontent resource broker\u201d (CRB) or \u201cbandwidth section broker\u201d. The main difference between the network resource broker described in this document and conventional brokers is that the conventional brokers work with bandwidth, in bits per second, as the requested and admitted resource, while the network resource broker described in this document works with the total volume of the content to be transferred, in bytes, and the time to download, i.e. the response time for the content to be transferred. Thus, a completely new resource management architecture is developed.","This new approach to resource management can with advantage be applied to Content Delivery Networks (CDN) and\/or in networks where e.g. intermediate hosting of content is motivated from a QoE-perspective (Quality of Experience). One problem for QoE today, is that there is no guaranteed minimum bandwidth for content in a network. In the described resource management approach, however, both minimum bandwidth guarantee and differentiation between different delivery times in networks are supported. In a traffic mix of file sharing and QoE-sensitive traffic, the new architecture can be especially advantageous, by being able to provide a differentiated content transfer performance, which will be described in more detail below. The described architecture is also beneficial for other types of network services with better guarantees, i.e. in networks with a large volume of delivery of content, and where differentiation between different deliveries would improve the network performance.","The new network resource broker should be able to admit or deny a request for resources, in order to limit the number of simultaneous transfers. Further, the broker should be able to schedule the content indicated in a request based on information on free network capacity, which is available for transfer of content in the network. For example, a transfer of content could be delayed until enough free resources become available for allocation. The network resources are assigned to a certain transfer of content by the allocation of, often relatively large, time-slots, i.e. portions, sections or \u201cchunks\u201d of bandwidth. The portions could be of any size and could be dynamically assigned. It should be noted, that it is not fixed-size time-slots or subframes, as the ones commonly used in e.g. time division techniques that are referred to, but typically much larger slots, i.e. portions or \u201cchunks\u201d. Such a portion or chunk could be in the size of Gbytes, while ordinary e.g. TDM time-slots typically are in the size of approximately 100 bytes.","Further, the broker should be able to distinguish and prioritize between, e.g. response time sensitive transfers and non-response time sensitive transfers, and requests having other priority grounds. The allocation of network resources could e.g. be performed based on response time, and could actively prioritize transfers that require a short response time, and vice versa. Further, the broker should be able to generate a response to an entity, which has made a request for network resources to the broker. The broker could also comply with a request for minimum bandwidth if necessary.","The new architecture may provide a minimum QoE guarantee and a shorter latency to applications that require that service. The solution described in this document could be applied in both wired and wireless networks and combinations thereof. For wireless networks, or more explicit cellular networks, the CRB could be embedded in a Radio Network Controller (RNC), in base stations, relay nodes or any other equipment that can perform the functionality described above. In wireless networks, e.g. WLAN 3G or LTE, the maximal throughput depends on several different aspects, such as e.g. distance to base station and radio conditions. Therefore, the bandwidth in a wireless network is not as static as in a wired network scenario. In a wireless network scenario, the resource broker needs to consider the dynamics of the bandwidth between terminals and network nodes. High-priority content transfer comes first, and content transfer of lower priorities comes after. The fluctuations in bandwidth may also cause re-scheduling of content and re-allocation of network resources. This may also result in that some of the already admitted requests are rejected.","The response time parameter, when indicated in a request for resources sent by a requesting entity, may comprise an indicator of the strictness of the indicated maximal response time. The indicated response time could be e.g. a strict non-negotiable response time, or a mere recommendation. In situations where the requested response time is indicated as negotiable, the CRB and the requesting entity may negotiate about the response time if e.g. the CRB cannot comply with the initially requested response time. When the response time is not indicated in a request for resources sent by a requesting entity, a response time may instead be estimated by the CRB, which will be further described below. The strictness of the estimated response time could then be set based on e.g. the time sensitivity of the content to be transferred, or e.g. per default be set as being negotiable. The strictness of the response time could be associated with the priority of the request. Priorities will be further discussed later below.","Below, an exemplary brokering procedure and an exemplary content resource broker unit (CRBU) will be described in more detail, with reference to the flowchart in :",{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0052","num":"0051"},"figref":"FIG. 2","b":["200","202","204","202","204","206","208","210"]},{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0053","num":"0052"},"figref":"FIG. 1","b":["100","100","102","100","110","104","106","108"]},"The block diagram in  illustrates an embodiment of a content resource broker unit which is similar to the one illustrated in , but which also shows a scheduling unit . The scheduling unit  is adapted to schedule a certain content C for transfer within a predetermined response time, taking the information on available network capacity obtained by the resource unit  into account.","The scheduling unit may take the response time sensitivity of the content into account when scheduling the content for transfer, so that e.g. a time sensitive content can be prioritized over a content which is not as time sensitive. The scheduling unit may further assign free available network resources dynamically to the transfer of a content. A content transfer will be assigned resources in form of slots of bandwidth , which is illustrated in .","In  is also illustrated a computer program product ,  which comprises instructions , , which when executed by a processor ,  or similar, will cause the functional units - and -, respectively, to perform their tasks according to an embodiment of the described procedure. The processor is connected to the illustrated functional units. These connections are only indicated as a dashed arrow emerging from the processor , .",{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0057","num":"0056"},"figref":"FIG. 4","b":["408","408","402","1","404","1","406","1","402","406","404","402","406"]},"Below, the network resources, requests and responses will be further described:","The resources managed by the CRBU are managed in terms of the combination of time [s] and bandwidth [bps], where the multiplication of time and bandwidth should equal, or be larger than, the volume to be transferred [bits or bytes]. The time and bandwidth are assigned as slots, or \u201cchunks\u201d, of bandwidth, which could be of any size, and of different sizes, in terms of duration and bandwidth, within certain limits, which is illustrated in  as follows.",{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0060","num":"0059"},"figref":"FIG. 5","sub":["1 ","1"]},"The CRB should be able to derive the parameters: volume (Gbytes) of the content to be transferred, and: the maximum response time for the content, from the request. The parameters could be derived directly from the request or indirectly, e.g. based on information in the request. If the content volume is not explicitly included in the request, the volume could e.g. be obtained from a location where the content indicated in the request is stored, e.g. a cache in a network node. If the maximum response time is not explicitly included in the request, the maximum response time could e.g. be estimated and set based on one or more of: the type of the indicated content; the size of the indicated content, user preferences and\/or user subscription type.","Exemplary components of a request, according to one embodiment, are illustrated in . A user of a requesting entity wants to transfer a content C. The requesting entity forms a request , which comprises the parameter  specifying the volume of the content C, which the user of the requesting entity wants to transfer. In the example, the volume is denoted Xc, and given in the unit of Gbytes. However, other unit variants for specifying the volume are also possible, such as e.g. bits. The request further comprises a parameter  specifying a maximal required or desired response time Tc seconds. The request  comprising the parameters  and  is sent to a first CRBU, which is the broker for all or a part of the network links, over which the content C is to be transferred. The first CRBU analyzes the available network resources, and if necessary, sends a request to a second CRBU. The first CRBU determines if there are sufficient free available network resources in order to transfer the content C within the response time Tc, and a response is sent by the CRBU to the requesting entity, here illustrated as the alternative responses -. The response may comprise an \u201cadmit\u201d or a \u201cdeny\u201d notification, and may include an indication on when the transfer of content C should or can be initiated. If a request does not comprise one or both of the parameters volume of content and response time, these parameters could be obtained in some other way by the CRBU receiving the request, as previously stated.","The CRB could also be adapted to support requests for resources which further include a request for a minimum transfer rate, in order to support applications which require a certain minimum transfer rate in bps (bits per second). To provide a minimum bandwidth may sometimes be important in order to achieve an appropriate QoE for e.g. progressive download, which is used by e.g. YouTube and Web-TV applications. If a minimum bandwidth cannot be provided, such applications may suffer from interruptions in the transfers and thereby possibly in the content, when displayed to a user.","The responses sent to the requesting entities, illustrated as :, : and : in , comprise a notification of admittance or denial of the request for resources. The response could comprise an alternative suggested response time, for the requesting entity to accept or reject. Further, the response could comprise an indication of when the transfer of content could be started, e.g. in 10 ms or 2 h.","Alternatively, a request and\/or the response to the request could be queued in the CRBU until the transfer of content could be started, and then the response could be sent to the requesting entity with a permission to start the transfer.","Below, the CRBs ability to prioritize between requests will be discussed: The prioritization of different requests combined with scheduling of resources for transfer of content could be solved in different ways. A plurality of priority levels could be used, and the priority levels could, e.g. be indicated in the requests, or be derived from other information indicated in the requests, such as e.g. volume and\/or maximum response time of the content indicated in the request. Alternatively, the priority level could be derived from the user preferences or the user subscription type, which can be obtained e.g. from a HLR (Home Location Register), or the like. A request, which has been admitted, could possibly be rescheduled or rejected if a request of higher priority is received by a CRB.","A priority level could also or alternatively be related to the content indicated in a request. The priority level of the transfer of the content could correspond to the priority level of the request, or not. A priority level of the content transfer could be used for example when scheduling content for transfer. Resources allocated to a content transfer of a lower priority level than the priority level of the content transfer to be scheduled could be considered as non-allocated, i.e. free for allocation, when scheduling the content for transfer.","The requests could be categorized with respect to priority and be placed in an appropriate priority queue of requests. When a request reaches the front of a queue and is to be served, the appropriate, possibly previously reserved, resources will be allocated to the transfer of the content indicated in the request in question if possible. If there are enough available resources to accomplish a transfer of the content indicated in the request, a response will be sent to the requesting entity indicating that the request has been admitted. If there are not enough available resources to accomplish the transfer of the content indicated in the request, a response may be sent to the requesting entity, indicating that the request has been denied. Alternatively, the CRB may send a response comprising a suggested new response time, which new response time may be based on the estimated delivery time. This suggested response time could then be either accepted or rejected by the requesting entity. It should be noted that any kind of priority mechanism can be used, such as e.g. weighted fair queuing (WFQ), strict priority queuing (PQ) or weighted round-robin (WRR), and the invention is not limited in this respect.","Below, a multi-hop brokering scenario, and a suggested ability of the CRBs to store content, will be described: The described resource managing architecture can be applied as a distributed architecture in an overlay network, where the overlay nodes may have a storage capacity. In each hop between nodes, the current CRB can admit or deny requests, given resource constraints for the outgoing link, and allocate resources e.g. in order to ensure a minimum end2end throughput in cases where a minimum throughput has been requested. The outgoing link may be a virtual or logical link, i.e. a link comprising several hops or sub-links. When more than one CRB cooperate in a multi-hop scenario, the maximum response time for a transfer of content should be divided between the CRBs which are involved in order to complete the transfer. This division of the response time could be made in different ways, e.g. the CRBs could be provided with information on the distribution of CRBs, e.g. information on how many CRBs that will be involved in order enable a certain transfer, and the CRBs could then calculate the portion of the response time which they have to their disposal. Alternatively, each CRB could e.g. notify the next CRB in the multi-hop chain of how much of the response time that will be consumed in the transfer over the links which are brokered by the notifying CRB and the CRBs preceding the notifying CRB, i.e. how much of the response time that remains for the remaining part of the transfer.","A CRB may comprise or be co-located with a storage unit, e.g. a cache, which enables a local storage of the content to be transferred. Local storage of the content in transfer will enable the transfer of content to be shifted in time, i.e. in a controllable way be transferred over different links at different times, which may further increase the efficiency of the resource management.",{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0071","num":"0070"},"figref":"FIG. 6","b":["608","602","1","604","1","606","1","602","604","606","608","608","608","602","604","1","610","1","608","610","610","610","610","602","1","604","1","606","1","608","610","2","602","1","604","1","606","1","610","602","1","604","1","602","606","602","2","604","2","606","2"]},"Alternatively, one or more of the responses to the requesting entities could be sent by the first CRBU  after receiving the reply : from the second CRBU . Here, a two-hop scenario has been illustrated, but the principle is the same in situations where more than two CRBUs are involved. When a request is denied by one CRBU, as the request : in the example, it would also be possible for the first CRBU , which admits request :, to send a request to another CRBU, not shown in the figure, which may have enough network network resources, if the set of links, for which this other CRBU is the broker, is part of an alternative, redundant, route through the network to the destination of the content.","It is also possible that a request is admitted even though the estimated delivery times for all hops taken together exceeds the initially requested response time. In such a case, the requesting entity will receive a new suggested response time, in form of e.g. the total estimated delivery time for all hops, in a response from the CRBU, as previously mentioned.",{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0074","num":"0073"},"figref":"FIG. 7","b":["702","704","704","702"]},{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0075","num":"0074"},"figref":"FIG. 9","b":["908","910","902","906","904"]},"The network capacity resources may be of different types, e.g. IP-network resources, i.e. supported by MPLS-tunnels (MultiProtocol Label Switching); transmission links, i.e. SDH\/PDH; or Ethernet resources, i.e. MEF-defined (Metro Ethernet Forum) SLAs (Service Layer Agreement). In wireless parts of a network, the network capacity over a wireless link can be modelled as throughput with statistical delivery guarantees.","Below, some concluding remarks will be made.","It should be noted that  merely illustrate various functional units of the CRBUs  and  in a logical sense.

The architecture may provide content delivery fulfilling certain QoE-requirements within a predetermined response time.
