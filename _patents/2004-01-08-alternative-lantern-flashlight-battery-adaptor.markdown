{"@attributes":{"id":"description"},"GOVINT":[{},{}],"heading":["GOVERNMENT INTEREST","BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION","SUMMARY OF THE INVENTION","DETAILED DESCRIPTION OF THE PREFERRED EMBODIMENT"],"p":["The invention described herein may be manufactured, used, imported, sold, and licensed by or for the Government of the United States of America without the payment of any royalty thereon or therefor.","1. Field of the Invention","The present invention relates generally to adaptors for power sources and, more particularly, to adaptors for power sources used in energizing a lantern flashlight.","2. Related Art","Devices for adapting cell type batteries for use in connection with lanterns are known. For example, U.S. Pat. No. 4,806,440 to Hahs, Jr. et al. describes a lantern battery substitute that has an upper assembly  and lower assembly . As illustrated in , the upper assembly  and lower assembly  may be fitted together and, as such, approximate the dimensions of a lantern battery. The upper assembly  comprises spring contacts  and  and the lower assembly includes electrical bridges ,  and  between which an array of four \u201cD\u201d size battery cells is retained to provide a 6.0 volt output.","Another example is illustrated in U.S. Pat. No. 5,240,787 to Goldschmidt et al which describes a cell battery adaptor that has a main receptacle  and a hinged closure portion . As shown in , the hinged closure portion  connects with the main receptacle  via a hinge member  and may be opened to insert four \u201cD\u201d size batteries. A one-piece cell interconnecting element  may be disposed within the main receptacle and has contact rivets A\u2013H for engaging and connecting the terminals of the four batteries.","While the above-described devices may be suitable for adapting cell type batteries for powering lanterns, to date, no suitable device is available for adapting high voltage batteries for use with, e.g., military type lantern flashlights. A long felt need exists for such a device as numerous high voltage batteries are available with a charge that is suitable for use with lantern flashlights. For example, the Army purchases approximately 300,000 BA-5590\/U lithium batteries a year currently at a cost of approximately $75.00 per battery for a total of about $22.5 million a year. This particular battery is commonly used in manpack tactical radios such as the AN\/PRC-119 SINCGARS radio. Under current operating procedures, the radio operator is responsible for insuring that the radio will not shut down during a mission. The operator risks disciplinary action by the unit commander if he fails to install a fresh battery during pre-mission preparations and the battery is depleted prior to completion of the mission. In one particular case, a SINCGARS radio can operate for 32 hours on one BA-5590\/U battery, but the operator may change the battery every 24 hours. Partially used BA-5990\/U batteries will be returned to the unit supply point with 25 percent energy (40-watt hours) remaining which represents approximately $18.75 worth of energy.","It is believed that the partially used high voltage battery has little likelihood of use, and the supply personnel generally choose to activate the battery's internal self-discharge circuit to discharge the battery to zero volts to prepare it for disposal. This can represent up to an estimated $5.625 million of wasted energy annually.","Accordingly, a need exists for a suitable adaptor for use with high voltage batteries.","In accordance with an embodiment of the present invention, a lantern flashlight power source adaptor, which may be used with a battery that has an electrical socket, comprises a member and an electrical plug that is supported by the member. The electrical plug may be dimensioned and configured to be connectable with an electrical socket of a battery and the adaptor may also comprise at least one terminal connector that is connected in circuit with the electrical plug and that is located on the member.","Another aspect of the invention involves a lantern power source adaptor that may be used with a battery that has an electrical socket comprises a member and an electrical plug supported by the member. The electrical plug may be dimensioned and configured to be connectable with an electrical socket of a battery. The adaptor may also comprise at least one terminal connector located on the member, an electrical disconnect circuit connected in circuit with the electrical plug, and an electrical down converter circuit connected in circuit with the electrical plug.","A further aspect of the present invention involves a lantern power source adaptor for use with a battery that comprises a member and a means for electrically connecting with an electrical output of a battery and which is supported by the member. The adaptor also comprises a terminal connector means that is connectable with a lantern and that is located on the member. A means for disconnecting the battery at a predetermined voltage may be in circuit with the battery connecting means and means for downconverting a voltage of the battery also may be connected in circuit with the battery connecting means.","One embodiment of the present invention provides for the adapting of high voltage batteries for use with, e.g., military type lantern flashlights. It has been found that there is enough remaining energy in a partially used high voltage battery to operate less critical items commonly found in a typical Army unit such as lantern flashlights. It is believed that the user is less likely to face disciplinary action if a lantern flashlight fails during a mission. Also, during the Vietnam War, the Vietcong guerillas were able to power the lights in the tunnel networks by using discarded US Army magnesium batteries.","In this embodiment, a prismatic cap may be provided which may have two threaded post terminals or two spiral spring terminals commonly found on traditional zinc carbon or alkaline lantern batteries for lantern flashlights. An interior of the prismatic cap may include a battery terminal interface and a water resistant seal.","An adjustable strap may be employed to retain the cap on a high voltage battery and internal circuits supported by the cap may function to reduce the battery voltage as needed by the lantern flashlight and to open the circuit to the battery when the battery voltage reaches the minimum operating voltage. Opening the circuit to the battery reduces the likelihood of venting of the battery. Advantageously, the voltage cut-off circuit will not reset unless the battery is replaced.","Referring now to , a lantern flashlight battery adaptor in accordance with one embodiment of the present invention is illustrated generally at  and is shown as mounted to a high voltage battery . In this embodiment, the adaptor  may comprise a member or cap , electrical terminals , a holding strap  and an electrical connector such as a plug .","The cap  may be composed of a moldable polymeric substance such as a high density polyethylene and may comprise a plate  and side walls . The side walls  may extend in a perpendicular direction from the plate  and are preferably dimensioned to extend over and cover an upper portion  of the battery  to thereby form a cap-like structure. In order to prevent the ingress of moisture along an interior surface  of the cap , a sealing gasket  may be located adjacent the side walls . A recessed portion  may be provided for receipt of a circuit board  supporting a circuit that will be more fully described below. An input wire  and output wires  may extend through bores or recesses (not shown) in the cap  to electrically connect with the plug  and terminal connectors .","Referring now to , the terminal connectors  may extend from an upper surface  of the plate  and may each comprise a known threaded rod configuration. The terminal connectors  may each be located in a symmetric manner about a central axis  (see also ), although, it will be understood that the terminal connectors may be located similar to that of a civilian lantern battery such as Model MN-908 sold under the Trademark DURACELL. In such a case, the configuration of the plate  may be more square-shaped, rather than the rectangular configuration as shown, and one of the terminal connectors may be located concentric about a central axis thereof in a known manner. Also, it will be recognized that the terminal connectors  may comprise wire clamps (not shown) or a pair of wires having a conical, helical configuration.","The holding strap  is illustrated in  and may comprise a textile. The holding strap  may also include an adjustment mechanism  for tightly securing the adaptor  to the battery . Optionally, the holding strap may be composed of a pair of legs that may be L-shaped in cross section and dimensioned to fit under at least partially under the battery . The legs may each be composed of a polymeric material similar to that of the cap  such as a high density polyethylene and may also be molded contemporaneously with the cap .","With reference to , the plug  is shown for illustrational purposes as a male connector (designation SC-C-179492) and consequently may comprise a shield  and a plurality of pins . The plug  may be integrally formed with the cap  for ease in assembly, although, it will be understood that a separable plug connector may be employed in the practice of the present invention. Referring now also to , it will be appreciated that the plug  may be configured to correspond with a socket  of a high voltage battery , although, it may be of any suitable configuration for mating with any corresponding connector configuration. The battery , as illustrated in , may be a high voltage battery designated BA-5590\/U which may comprise a lithium sulfide and which may have a reduced voltage level that may be approximately ten to sixteen volts.","As illustrated in , circuitry  may be employed on the circuit board  and may include a downconverting circuit  and, optionally, an automatic disconnect circuit . The downconverting circuit  may function in a known manner to reduce the relatively high voltage of the battery  to a suitable output voltage and may comprise a pair of transformer coils (not shown). In the present embodiment the battery  may function to reduce the voltage from between ten to sixteen volts to approximately six volts.","The disconnect circuit  may function to provide an automatic disconnect from a load, such as a lantern flashlight (not shown), at a low voltage and to thereby prevent toxic substances escaping from the battery. The disconnect circuit  may comprise a comparator (not shown) connected to open the circuit when the battery  reduces to approximately ten volts.","This embodiment of the present invention includes the following advantages.","1. Provides a reusable adaptor for lantern flashlights.","2. Provides for the use military lithium sulfur dioxide batteries in lantern flashlights.","3. Provides for the use of partially depleted lithium sulfur dioxide batteries that do not possess sufficient energy to meet minimum requirements for critical military items, but sufficient energy to power non-critical items. Without the present invention, the left over energy in these expensive lithium batteries will be wasted.","4. Provides a DC\/DC converter that will reduce the high voltage military batteries to lantern voltage.","5. Provides an electronic battery disconnect circuit when the battery reaches minimum cut-off voltage to avoid lithium battery venting. Advantageously, the disconnect circuit may reset if the battery is replaced.","6. Provides an adaptor interface with battery that is water-resistant.","7. May be used on existing military batteries with no modifications.","8. Does not require special tools or training to install and operate.","While the present invention has been described in connection with what are presently considered to be the most practical and preferred embodiments, it is to be understood that the present invention is not limited to these herein disclosed embodiments. Rather, the present invention is intended to cover all of the various modifications and equivalent arrangements included within the spirit and scope of the appended claims."],"BRFSUM":[{},{}],"brief-description-of-drawings":[{},{}],"description-of-drawings":{"heading":"BRIEF DESCRIPTION OF THE DRAWINGS","p":["Other objects and advantages of the invention will be evident to one of ordinary skill in the art from the following detailed description made with reference to the accompanying drawings, in which:",{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0015","num":"0014"},"figref":"FIG. 1"},{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0016","num":"0015"},"figref":["FIG. 2","FIG. 1","FIG. 1"],"b":"2"},{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0017","num":"0016"},"figref":["FIG. 3","FIG. 1"]},{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0018","num":"0017"},"figref":"FIG. 4"},{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0019","num":"0018"},"figref":["FIG. 5","FIG. 1"]}]},"DETDESC":[{},{}]}
