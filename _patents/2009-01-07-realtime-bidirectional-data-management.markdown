No. 61\/020,975, entitled \u201cMethod and System for Field Drilling Operations,\u201d filed on Jan. 14, 2008, which is hereby incorporated by reference in its entirety.","This application contains subject matter that may be related to U.S. application Ser. No. 11\/215,605, Francine Evans, et al., \u201cMiddleware method and apparatus and program storage device adapted for linking data sources to software applications,\u201d filed Aug. 30, 2005 and assigned to Schlumberger Technology Corporation.","Operations, such as surveying, drilling, wireline testing, completions, production, planning and field analysis, are typically performed to locate and gather valuable downhole fluids. Surveys are often performed using acquisition methodologies, such as seismic scanners or surveyors to generate maps of underground formations. These formations are often analyzed to determine the presence of subterranean assets, such as valuable fluids or minerals, or to determine if the formations have characteristics suitable for storing fluids.","During drilling and production operations, data is typically collected for analysis and\/or monitoring of the operations. Such data may include, for example, information regarding subterranean formations, equipment, and historical and\/or other data.","Data concerning the subterranean formation is collected using a variety of sources. Such formation data may be static or dynamic. Static data relates to, for example, formation structure and geological stratigraphy that define geological structures of the subterranean formation. Dynamic data relates to, for example, fluids flowing through the geologic structures of the subterranean formation over time. Such static and\/or dynamic data may be collected to learn more about the formations and the valuable assets contained therein.","An example method for real-time bi-directional data management includes receiving a requested data description list from a field application associated with a drilling system, receiving an available data description list from a data source, and subscribing to available data by mapping the available data description list to the requested data description list, the available data having a first data format and a first communication protocol associated with the data source and including a first context identifier assigned by the data source for identifying a portion of the available data. The method further includes modifying the available data to generate first modified data having a second data format and a second communication protocol for sending to the field application, the first modified data including the first context identifier for identifying a portion of the first modified data, and selectively performing a field operation based on the first modified data to generate processed data by the field application, the processed data including the first context identifier for identifying a portion of the processed data. The method further includes modifying the processed data to generate second modified data having the first data format and the first communication protocol, the second modified data being stored in the data source.","Other aspects of the inventive concept will be apparent from the following description and the appended claims.","Specific embodiments will now be described in detail with reference to the accompanying figures. Like elements in the various figures are denoted by like reference numerals for consistency.","In the following detailed description, numerous specific details are set forth in order to provide a more thorough understanding. In other instances, well-known features have not been described in detail to avoid obscuring embodiments of real-time, bi-directional data management.","In general, embodiments of real-time, bi-directional data management provide a method and system for obtaining field data. More specifically, use of real-time, bi-directional data management, in part, includes read operations and write-back operations for a wide variety of field applications (e.g., acquisition system, engineering analysis, real-time surveillance, data broker service, and other oilfield applications) based on a wide variety of data sources for field operations, such as database system, file system, web service, peer application, multi-pass source, subscription service, and other data sources. In some embodiments, real-time data workflows of field data consider context information (e.g. wellbore name, drilling tool run number, etc.) throughout a read operation followed by a write-back operation with modification of data in the intervening field application.","Furthermore, in some embodiments of the invention, real-time data workflows are capable of requesting multiple data channels in a single operation and processing data logs from multiple drilling tool runs and associated drilling tool passes. In addition, the exchange of field data may be performance-optimized to reduce data transfers and also to manage the system load of both data sources and field applications. The real-time data workflows may be capable of, but not limited to, one of more of the following: efficient transparent write-back, multi-homed write-back, write-back cache persistency, publishing data back to the data source, efficient reading of multiple channels of data concurrently, providing access to data from multiple operations, providing context information to the application and reflecting the application context within the user-interface, providing detailed context information back to the application, transforming queries and responses based upon a selected source without the need for a new adapter, applying the transformations in a configurable pipeline effecting template reuse and modularization, specifying a global start and end point to govern the data flow, etc.","FIGS. .-. depict simplified, representative, schematic views of a field () having subterranean formation () containing reservoir () therein and depicting various field operations being performed on the field ().  depicts a survey operation being performed by a survey tool, such as seismic truck (.) to measure properties of the subterranean formation.

Production may also include injection wells (not shown) for added recovery. One or more gathering facilities may be operatively connected to one or more of the wellsites for selectively collecting downhole fluids from the wellsite(s).","While FIGS. .-. depict tools used to measure properties of a field (), it will be appreciated that the tools may be used in connection with non-wellsite operations, such as mines, aquifers, storage or other subterranean facilities. Also, while certain data acquisition tools are depicted, it will be appreciated that various measurement tools capable of sensing parameters, such as seismic two-way travel time, density, resistivity, production rate, etc., of the subterranean formation and\/or its geological formations may be used. Various sensors (S) may be located at various positions along the wellbore and\/or the monitoring tools to collect and\/or monitor the desired data. Other sources of data may also be provided from offsite locations.","The field configuration in FIGS. .-. is intended to provide a brief description of an example of a field usable with real-time data workflows. Part, or all, of the field () may be on land and\/or sea. Also, while a single field measured at a single location is depicted, real-time data workflows may be utilized with any combination of one or more fields (), one or more processing facilities and one or more wellsites.",{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0034","num":"0033"},"figref":["FIG. 2","FIG. 1.2"],"b":["400","311","334","313"]},"The drilling system () includes a drill string () suspended within the borehole () with a drill bit () at its lower end. The drilling system () also includes the land-based platform and derrick assembly () positioned over the borehole () penetrating a subsurface formation (F). The assembly () includes a rotary table (), kelly (), hook () and rotary swivel (). The drill string () is rotated by the rotary table (), energized by means not shown, which engages the kelly () at the upper end of the drill string. The drill string () is suspended from hook (), attached to a traveling block (also not shown), through the kelly () and a rotary swivel () which permits rotation of the drill string relative to the hook.","The drilling system () further includes drilling fluid or mud () stored in a pit () formed at the well site. A pump () delivers the drilling fluid () to the interior of the drill string () via a port in the swivel (), inducing the drilling fluid to flow downwardly through the drill string () as indicated by the directional arrow (). The drilling fluid exits the drill string () via ports in the drill bit (), and then circulates upwardly through the region between the outside of the drill string and the wall of the borehole, called the annulus (). In this manner, the drilling fluid lubricates the drill bit () and carries formation cuttings up to the surface as it is returned to the pit () for recirculation.","The drill string () further includes a bottom hole assembly (BHA), generally referred to as (), near the drill bit () (in other words, within several drill collar lengths from the drill bit). The bottom hole assembly () includes capabilities for measuring, processing, and storing information, as well as communicating with the surface unit. The BHA () further includes drill collars () for performing various other measurement functions.","Sensors (S) are located about the wellsite to collect data, in real time, concerning the operation of the wellsite, as well as conditions at the wellsite. The sensors (S) of  may be the same as the sensors of FIGS. .-..","The drilling system () is operatively connected to the surface unit () for communication therewith. The BHA () is provided with a communication subassembly () that communicates with the surface unit. The communication subassembly () is adapted to send signals to and receive signals from the surface using mud pulse telemetry. It will be appreciated by one of skill in the art that a variety of telemetry systems may be employed, such as wired drill pipe, electromagnetic or other known telemetry systems.","Typically, the wellbore is drilled according to a drilling plan that is established prior to drilling. The drilling plan typically sets forth equipment, pressures, trajectories and\/or other parameters that define the drilling process for the wellsite. The drilling operation may then be performed according to the drilling plan. However, as information is gathered, the drilling operation may need to deviate from the drilling plan. Additionally, as drilling or other operations are performed, the subsurface conditions may change. The earth model may also need adjustment as new information is collected.",{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0041","num":"0040"},"figref":["FIG. 3.1","FIG. 3.1"],"b":["500","552","551","500","501","521","541","521","541","553"]},"The middleware apparatus () is capable of supporting real-time data workflows and may be referred to as a Real-Time Data Link (RTDL) in some examples. A field application () may be configured to operate cooperatively with the RTDL () and referred to as RTDL-enabled software application (also referred to herein as RTDL-enabled application). Based on the functionality of the RTDL (), each software application () may include a graphical user interface (i.e., GUI) () to obtain data from any data source () without the need to be configured specifically for the data formats and the communication protocols associated with the received data. The graphical user interface () may be displayed to a user by the RTDL-enabled field application ().","Further, as shown in , the RTDL () includes application programming interface (API) (), data adapters (), requested data description list (RDDL) (), available data description list (ADDL) (), write-back engine (), and data dispatch engine ().","The API () may include public methods of RTDL (), which the field applications () may call. These public methods of API () abstract many differences between the real-time data sources () and provides the field applications () with a consistent way of consuming source data, which may be implemented in the graphical user interface (). From a user interaction perspective, one or more of the data sources () may be selected via the graphical user interface () available via one of the field applications (), and then the user is guided through a series of data source-specific interactions that result in the selected data being asynchronously transferred to the application. In this process, the data adapters () handle all the communication with the data sources () thus hiding the differences in the communication protocols from the field applications (). Multiple data sources may be interfaced within an adapter. Most data sources may be live and supplying real-time data to the RTDL (), but the RTDL () may also be configured with the capability to process local drilling files having historical data. In the case of live data sources, the RTDL () may be further configured to optimize interactions with the data sources () in order to reduce data transfers and to reduce the system load of both the data sources () and the field applications ().","In one or more embodiments, the RTDL () optimizes interactions with the data sources () by accommodating for lagging channels (i.e., sparsely available field data). For instance, lagging channels may occur, but not limited to, when querying multiple data channels sharing a common index and at least one of the data channels does not span the entire index range, when data gaps exist for certain data channels while others are real-time data, or when a late available data description selection by the user occurs during a mature real-time session. In this instance, the lagging channels may result in query responses including superfluous data that has been previously processed in the session, causing the RTDL () to fall behind real-time because data sources () may limit the amount of data returned in each query. The RTDL () may be configured to accommodate the lagging channels by performing continuous pre-query analysis of the requested data channels and sub-dividing the data channels into independent query groups, which are sent as separate requests. In this case, the query group associated with the lagging channels may rejoin the real-time query group once the lagging channels achieve real-time.","In one or more embodiments, the RTDL () optimizes interactions with the data sources () based on the status of field data in the data sources (). Examples of statuses of field data include, but are not limited to, incrementally increasing, temporarily paused, or complete (i.e., no additional field data). The RTDL () may initially determine by default that the data of each data source () is increasing. The RTDL () may be further configured to pre-query a timestamp of the data sources () to reduce the occurrence of unnecessary queries for completed field data. For instance, once the field data of a particular data source () is complete, the RTDL () may determine based on a timestamp from the particular data source () that a continuous query of the particular data source () is no longer necessary. In this instance, if the field data of the particular data source () is subsequently increased, the RTDL () is notified based on the timestamp and may resume querying the particular data source () normally.","The series of data source-specific interactions described above may be embodied in a variety of workflows. For instance, requested data description list (RDDL) () may be supplied by the field application () to the RTDL (). An RDDL is a flexible object that provides a search filter for the RTDL () in interrogating one or more data sources () regarding available data. RDDL () may be with or without wildcards. As a result, search results may be returned from interrogated data sources () in the form of available data description list (ADDL) (). A user of the field applications () may then map the RDDL and the ADDL for matching available data to the initial requests. An example of ADDL () is described in detail with respect to  below. A feature may also be available to automatically provide RDDL to ADDL mappings, without the necessity of user interaction.","In addition, the RTDL () also includes a write-back engine () and a data dispatcher (). The write-back engine () is configured to provide the capability to publish data back to the data sources (). The data dispatcher is configured to provide context information to the application. Also, the API can be employed to reflect the application context within the graphical user interface (). The RTDL () may also be configured with the capabilities to transform queries and responses based upon a selected source, read multiple channels of data concurrently, provide access to data from multiple operations, etc. More details of these capabilities are described with respect to  and  below. Field applications and users may use the framework () to specify a global start and end point to govern the real-time data workflow.",{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0049","num":"0048"},"figref":["FIG. 3.2","FIG. 3.1","FIG. 3.2"],"b":["550","553","550","550","501","550","531","1","531","6","503","507","504","505","506","508","509","512"]},"As shown in , one or more data sources () of  may include database system (.), web service (.), RTDL-enabled peer application (.), multi-pass source (.), file system (.), subscription service (.), or other field data sources. Each of these real-time data sources () may be coupled to a particular data adaptor, such as data adaptors (.)-(.). For instance, the data adapters may include functionalities for communicating with WITSML (Wellsite Information Transfer Standard Markup Language) API Servers, communicating with a Drilling Acquisition Systems, consuming real-time drilling files published on a server, consuming files recorded by a RTDL recorder tool (e.g., testing and simulation tool), etc. Although not shown in , each adaptor type may be associated with a set of one or more data sources (). Each data source(s) () may be represented by an XML configuration, which includes references to the various adaptor methods. In some instances, a sub-class may be derived from an adaptor to provide special behavior required by a data source. For instance, source-specific behavioral differentiation may be reflected in XSL (extensible style-sheet language) transforms of the request and response messages for the WITSML API Servers.","The data adapters () described above may be configured to transform data from one or more data sources () based on the requirements of a field application (). In this case, the data adapters () may use transformation scripts to transform the data from the data sources (). Further, the transformation scripts may be modularized such that common transformations may be shared between multiple data adapters () and data sources () (i.e., a transformation pipeline). For instance, multiple data sources () may include similar types of data; thus, the corresponding data adapters () may require a common transformation for at least a portion of the similar types of data. In this instance, each data adapter () may also use additional transformations that are specific to other data sources () associated with the data adapter (). Those skilled in the art will appreciate that the modularization of transformation scripts facilitates the combination of reusable, vendor-neutral transformation scripts and vendor-specific transformation scripts.","In addition, the field applications () (as also shown in ) may include acquisition system (.), engineering analysis (.), real-time surveillance (.), data broker services (.), or other application types (.). The acquisition system (.) may be \u201cwrite only\u201d in the sense that it only performs the write-back operation ( in ) without any read operation ( in ). The real-time surveillance (.) and data broker services may be read only in the sense that it only performs read operation ( in ) without any write-back operation ( in ) The engineering analysis (.) may be may be read-write capable in the sense that read data from one of the data source(s) () may be modified, adjusted, or otherwise processed by the engineering analysis (.) and written back to the data source(s) () subsequently. In some examples, the field application may be multi-homed in the sense that it may be reading from one data source while writing back to another data source. A field application may connect simultaneously to two or more RTDL instances each associated with a different data source. The first RTDL instance may be used for reading data while the second RTDL instance may be used for writing back data. Multi-homed field application may be used in, for instance providing correlation between different wells, or assimilating disparate data from multiple data sources.","One or more of the data sources (.)-(.) may provide many different types of data such as data log, trajectory, risk, message, wellbore geometry (wbGeometry), tubular, operations report (opsReport), etc. Each data type may be formatted differently. For instance, data log may be formatted as a trace chart, a spread-sheet like table, or other appropriate formats. In this instance, a well log may represent resistivity or other measurements taken by a wireline tool at various depths as a depth indexed trace chart. A data log may also be time indexed containing, for instance, hookload measurements at various time points. Furthermore, a data log may include data from multiple data channels corresponding to multiple sensors of a data source. For instance, a data log with a table format may include multiple columns of data channels and multiple rows of data taken at different depth or time. Each point entry relating to a particular data channel at a particular depth or time is referred to as a data point. A single row of data points containing data relating to multiple data channels taken at a common index value is referred to as a vector of data points, or a \u2018pseudo data frame\u2019. Data depicted in the data queues () and () may represent data points or vectors of data points. The data queues () and () may also contain more complex data structures, such as trajectory station or risk data.","In addition, data may be tagged with context information. Context information may include attributes for identifying a data source such as well name (WellName), well ID (WellID), wellbore name (WellboreName), wellbore ID (WellboreID), section name (SectionName), subsection name (SubSectionName), etc. Context information may also include attributes for identifying data collection parameters such as log name, log ID, run number, pass number, pass type, etc. Further, detailed information about logs, channels, and the ADDL ( in ) may be available via the API ().","Further as shown in , the write-back engine () may operate on data from a data queue () enqueued through the API () from the field application (.)-(.). The write-back engine () may be configured to perform multiple functionalities, which are described below. Within the real-time data workflows (), the field applications (.)-(.) may specify the destination (or target) of the write-back operation ( in FIG. .)), but the context may be late bound. For instance, a write-back call of the API () may include a log name and log ID as a target, but the WellName, WellID, WellboreName and WellboreID may be determined and applied after a connection to the data source is made prior to writing, which is the meaning of the term \u201cwith context\u201d in . The write-back engine () may support two possible operations, namely \u2018add request\u2019 for adding new data object on the data source or \u2018update request\u2019 for updating existing data object on the data source. The operations (adding or updating) are transparent to the field applications (.)-(.). An \u2018add request\u2019 may be sent first, and if this fails because the data object already exists, all future requests may then be converted to \u2018update requests\u2019 by the write-back engine ().","In one or more embodiments, the write-back engine () may be configured to process generic, vendor-neutral write requests for different vendor-specific data sources (.)-(.). For instance, the write-back engine () may handle non-standardized error codes returned from the different data sources (.)-(.) when a fault occurs. In this instance, the RTDL () may employ an error code normalization model to allow the write-back engine () to handle faults from different data sources (.)-(.) in a homogenous manner.","Write-back data may be cached inside RTDL () under control of the write-back engine () so that the field applications (.)-(.) may operate using a \u2018fire and forget\u2019 model, i.e. applications may use the Write Back API without waiting to determine whether the operations are immediately successful. Accordingly, field applications (.)-(.) need not be concerned with managing the connection state of the real-time data workflows. RTDL () manages the write-back cache () for data buffering during disconnects or until the write-back operations are successfully completed. The data buffering may be performed in memory (not shown) and backed up on disk (not shown). Statistics for numbers of rows and tables in the write-back cache may be made available to the field applications (.)-(.).","Examples of high level calls associated with a \u2018RTDL.DataWriter\u2019 object of the RTDL () are given in TABLE 1 below.",{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0059","num":"0058"},"tables":{"@attributes":{"id":"TABLE-US-00001","num":"00001"},"table":{"@attributes":{"frame":"none","colsep":"0","rowsep":"0"},"tgroup":{"@attributes":{"align":"left","colsep":"0","rowsep":"0","cols":"1"},"colspec":{"@attributes":{"colname":"1","colwidth":"217pt","align":"left"}},"thead":{"row":[{"entry":"TABLE 1"},{"entry":{"@attributes":{"namest":"1","nameend":"1","align":"center","rowsep":"1"}}}]},"tbody":{"@attributes":{"valign":"top"},"row":[{"entry":"AddLogDataToCache - a DataTable of log objects is passed;"},{"entry":"AddRtdlDataObjectToCache - an ISurvey or IRisk is passed; and"},{"entry":"Add WitsmlDocToCache - a complete WITSML document is passed,"},{"entry":"where Log, Trajectory, Risk, WITSML documents are examples of"},{"entry":"various data types.

This setting may affect the behavior of the RTDL () and the graphical user interface. It may be set dynamically, or set in the configuration file of the field applications (.)-(.).

The query may be submitted based on the RDDL (), which may include requests relating to multiple data channels. A substantial performance increase may be realized by using Multi-Channel Queries (MCQ) for data from data sources, such as a WITSML API server. Instead of requesting a single data channel in a querying a data source, the query preparation engine () groups a query for multiple data channels into a single request resulting in a substantially lower number of requests and responses, reducing overall bandwidth, and improving overall performance. In a typical drilling operation, processing depth-indexed MCQ responses may require properly managing offsets and lagging channels while processing time-indexed responses via MCQ is relatively straight-forward. The response processing engine () may be configured to consider effects of offset and lagging among multiple data channels with respect to a common index in a data log. The response processing engine () may be configured to intelligently, and frequently, decide which data channels to involve in calculating the overall minimum depth index for accommodating \u2018lagging\u2019 data channels without being bound by data channels that are not actively increasing. The response processing engine () may also be configured to consider duplicated data from overlaps in prior queries when processing depth-indexed MCQ responses. In this case, a data source () may be configured to provide a timestamp indicating when the data source () was last updated. The query preparation engine () may consult the last update timestamp of data sources () to optimize data retrieval. For example, the query preparation engine () may specify that only data updated after a specified time should be queried, where the response processing engine () may use duplicate data from a prior query if the data has not been updated.","In addition, the response processing engine () may be configured to manage lagging channels as a query is performed. For instance, if a lagging channel is detected, the response processing engine () may separate the portion of the MCQ related to the lagging channel into a separate query. In this instance, the original query may be completed, providing the requested data to a field application () while the separate query associated with the lagging channel is still pending.","The high level algorithm and the detailed algorithm for MCQ are given in TABLE 3 and TABLE 4, respectively.",{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0067","num":"0069"},"tables":{"@attributes":{"id":"TABLE-US-00003","num":"00003"},"table":{"@attributes":{"frame":"none","colsep":"0","rowsep":"0"},"tgroup":[{"@attributes":{"align":"left","colsep":"0","rowsep":"0","cols":"1"},"colspec":{"@attributes":{"colname":"1","colwidth":"217pt","align":"center"}},"thead":{"row":[{"entry":"TABLE 3"},{"entry":{"@attributes":{"namest":"1","nameend":"1","align":"center","rowsep":"1"}}},{"entry":"For every data query to the server:"},{"entry":{"@attributes":{"namest":"1","nameend":"1","align":"center","rowsep":"1"}}}]},"tbody":{"@attributes":{"valign":"top"},"row":{"entry":{}}}},{"@attributes":{"align":"left","colsep":"0","rowsep":"0","cols":"2"},"colspec":[{"@attributes":{"colname":"1","colwidth":"14pt","align":"left"}},{"@attributes":{"colname":"2","colwidth":"203pt","align":"left"}}],"tbody":{"@attributes":{"valign":"top"},"row":[{"entry":[{},"1.

Examples of individual data points may include a single data channel in a single row of a table formatted data log. Examples of a vector of data points may include an entire row relating to multiple data channels sharing a common index value in a table formatted data log. Data context information (e.g., \u2018PassNumber\u2019, \u2018RunNumber\u2019, and direction parameters) needs to be provided to the field application () along with the vector of data points for data interpretation. This vector of data points may be considered a \u2018Pseudo Data Frame\u2019. A data log (e.g., any of the logged runs ()-()) dispatched in vectors is typically globally ordered by index value, and logically contains related groups having multiple adjacent \u2018Pseudo Data Frames\u2019 that share a common index progressing through consecutive values. To split the related groups out of the vectors, the response processing engine () and the dispatcher () of the log processing module () may be configured to consider that, in general the related groups may not be explicitly identified and data channels may be missing values corresponding to a given index value.","As RT field application () requests data from data source(s) (), a request data description list (RDDL) () is generated in the RTDL () to describe details of data requested from the field application ().

The ADDL () is updated accordingly by the \u2018Channel Refresh Worker\u2019 thread (.). For instance, ADDL (), as depicted in , indicates that available data from data channel A may be found in data logs LD, LRU, LRDm LRU, LRD, LTO, LD, LRU, LRD, and LTO; available data from data channel B, may be found in data logs LD, LRU, LRDm LRU, LRD, LTO, LD, LRU, LRD, and LTO; and available data from data channel C may be found in data logs LD, LRU, LRD, and LTO.","In addition, the \u2018Data Worker\u2019 thread (.) executed via the response processing engine () and the dispatcher () may treat drilling and non-drilling passes in two distinct ways as follows:\n\n","In addition, the response processing engine () may enqueue data vectors into related groups (., .)
