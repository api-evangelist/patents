{"@attributes":{"id":"description"},"BRFSUM":[{},{}],"heading":["BACKGROUND","SUMMARY","DETAILED DESCRIPTION"],"p":["Navigation devices have become popular tools for helping users navigate a route of travel to a specified destination. Oftentimes, a user may utilize a navigation device to aid in navigating to a specified destination, and may also seek one or more intermediate points of interest while traveling toward the specified destination. For example, a user may want to stop to refuel his\/her automobile or to eat at a restaurant while en route to a final destination. Some current navigation systems provide users an ability to search and locate points of interest (e.g., restaurants, fuel stations, hotels, automatic teller machines (ATMs), etc.) in a given area. For example, some navigation systems allow users to enter a location into a search field by entering a specific address, a zip code, a name of a city, a name of a business, a type of business, a phrase, etc. A search may produce a list of search results and\/or one or more selectable map points displayed on a map interface. Current navigation systems may additionally present a distance and\/or travel time to each point of interest.","Some current navigation systems may allow a user to enter one or more points of interest along a specified route to a destination. Such systems may recalculate the distance and travel time to the destination to include the added intermediate point(s) of interest. While current navigation systems offer the above and other features, current systems do not provide for associating user preference data to calculate a route deviation cost associated with one or more intermediate points of interest to allow a user to select an optimal route.","It is with respect to these and other considerations that the present invention has been made.","Embodiments of the present invention provide deviation cost-based filtering of one or more potential intermediate points of interest along a route to a primary destination. According to embodiments, a search for an intermediate point of interest (e.g., a fuel station, a restaurant, an ATM, etc.) may filter intermediate point of interest search results by user preferences. Filtering may be based on one or more of a user's preferences to stay within a certain distance of an existing route of travel to a primary destination, characteristics of additional travel beyond an exiting route of travel, impact to overall travel time, and\/or weighting based on user preferences for a particular brand or type of intermediate point of interest. A route of travel may be adjusted so that total travel distance\/time to both the end destination and to intermediate points of interest may be minimized.","Embodiments of the present invention provide users with point of interest search results based on a calculated deviation cost from a route to a primary destination. A cost may be based on various methodologies including, but not limited to, driving distance, travel time based on real-time traffic information, a number of right-hand turns versus left-hand turns along a route, a number of traffic lights along a route, etc. Embodiments may provide a calculation of both a total cost and a route-deviation cost for each potential intermediate point of interest. Intermediate point of interest search results may be filtered based on presets for both total and deviation costs, providing users with a more relevant and efficient travel experience by filtering intermediate point of interest search results according to user preferences.","The details of one or more embodiments are set forth in the accompanying drawings and description below. Other features and advantages will be apparent from a reading of the following detailed description and a review of the associated drawings. It is to be understood that the following detailed description is explanatory only and is not restrictive of the invention as claimed.","As briefly described above, embodiments of the present invention are directed to providing deviation cost-based filtering of one or more potential intermediate points of interest along a route to a primary destination. A preferred routing may be determined by associating a cost with one or more intermediate points of interest, the costs being based on user preference data.","Various navigation-enabled devices and systems may be utilized for presenting navigation options. A navigation system may include a user end-point device capable of displaying navigation and deviation cost information to a user. For example, navigation systems may be built-in or removable navigation systems, mobile phones, smart phones, wireless computers, tablet computers, and the like, or any device equipped with wireless navigation capabilities. Analyzing criteria and calculating\/processing deviation costs may be done locally within the local navigation device or system, or remotely over a distributed computer network and database via broadband, Wi-Fi, etc.","Various intermediate destinations such as fuel stations, restaurants, ATM's (Automated Teller Machines), hotels, convenience stores, and the like, may be potential intermediate points of interest while traveling along a route toward a destination. According to embodiments, a user of a navigation system, such as a global positioning system (GPS) navigation device or a GPS-enabled device, may input preference data associated with various factors including, but not limited to, fuel consumption, road class, traffic, a number of traffic lights, a number of right-hand turns, a number of left-hand turns, road construction, restaurant type, hotel class, specific merchants, etc. The input preference data may be utilized to determine a total cost and a route deviation cost associated with each point of interest (POI) along a route. According to a user's preferences, cost penalties, herein referred to as route deviation costs, may be applied to factors associated with a rerouting to a POI. Each factor may have an individual deviation cost associated with it, or a deviation cost may be associated with a combination of factors. According to embodiments, route deviation costs may be weighted differently according to user preference data specified by a user.","As discussed above, current navigation systems may fail to consider user preferences when providing search results for intermediate points of interest. For example, and as shown in , a search for \u201crestaurant\u201d  utilizing current systems may provide a user with results , , , , , ,  within a given radius  or within a certain driving time of the user's current location . Some current navigation systems may provide detailed information about a POI when a respective map point , , , , ,  is selected. Although map points may be displayed because the respective POI meets search criteria (e.g., category, within search radius, etc.), options presented to a user may not be optimal to the user based on various preferences the user may have. One or more points of interest presented to a user may not be deemed as an acceptable choice to the user if, for example, travel to a particular POI adds a certain amount of additional travel distance, increases an overall travel time, entails routing the user through a congested area, or if the particular POI is not a desired type or brand of business (e.g., fast food instead of sit-down restaurant, a brand of bank with which the user does not have an account, etc.).","Embodiments of the present invention provide filtered POI search results based on a calculated total cost and a calculated route-deviation cost for each potential intermediate POI. These embodiments may be combined, other embodiments may be utilized, and structural changes may be made without departing from the spirit or scope of the present invention. The following detailed description is therefore not to be taken in a limiting sense, and the scope of the present invention is defined by the appended claims and their equivalents. Referring now to the drawings, in which like numerals refer to like elements throughout the several figures, embodiments of the present invention and an exemplary operating environment will be described.","Referring now to , a simplified block diagram of a communication network architecture that serves as an exemplary operating environment for the present invention is illustrated. According to embodiments of the present invention, a variety of navigation-enabled devices and systems may be utilized with a cost based navigation system.","Various navigation-enabled devices may be utilized for navigation purposes by pedestrians, users of non-automated vehicles, and users of automated vehicles, such as automobile . The term \u201cnavigation system device\u201d will herein be used to describe a device operable to provide location, routing, and POI information. Some navigation system device examples include, but are not limited to, a Global Positioning System (GPS) receiver , a mobile communication device , a Personal Digital Assistant (PDA) , a tablet computer , a personal computer , etc. A navigation-enabled device , , , ,  may be equipped with a GPS system, wherein the GPS system is operative to provide routing information and to determine a user's  location. Once a user's location has been determined, the GPS system may calculate other information, such as speed, bearing, track trip distance, distance to destination, sunrise and sunset time and more. When coupled with a navigation application, a navigation system device can pinpoint the device's location, give directions to a provided destination, and may provide information about nearby points of interest.","According to embodiments, if a device does not comprise a GPS system, network-based location technologies, accelerometer mechanisms, or wireless positioning systems, for example, WIFI-based systems, may be utilized to provide location information. According to one embodiment, a location of a device may be determined via a reference network comprised of known locations of wireless access points (i.e., wireless positioning system or WPS). Wireless access points and their locations may be used by a mobile computing device  to triangulate a user's position. WPS may be combined with cellular tower triangulation and GPS to provide location data. A navigation system device may utilize other location determining means, such as client software that may compute the device's location by cell identification and signal strengths of home and neighboring cells. Mobile computing device  may utilize a service provider's network infrastructure to identify a location of the device. A hybrid positioning system may also be utilized for location determination, wherein the hybrid system may use a combination of network-based and device-based technologies to compute a location.","A navigation system device may be utilized to communicate with one or more remote applications or other endpoint devices via a communications network . As should be appreciated, the numerous endpoint devices illustrated in  may be utilized to send and\/or receive communications in various operating environments according to various types of transmissions, including navigation transmissions.","The network  is illustrative of one or more data delivery systems through which the various endpoint devices\/systems may operate. For example, the satellite system  may be utilized to send data transmissions via high-frequency, low-powered radio signals. The wireless system  may be utilized for wireless voice, text and data transmissions. The IP-based system  may be utilized for any of a variety of Internet protocol-based services such as voice and data transmissions. Other systems  are illustrative of any number of other systems that may be utilized for providing communications between various endpoint devices with other endpoint devices, software applications and data repositories. A single combined system may be provided by a given service provider for providing multiple types of the aforementioned communications services, including navigation systems.","Referring still to , a cost based navigation server  and associated database  may serve as a central computerized system for receiving, processing, calculating, mapping, routing, and data storage according to the embodiments of this invention. The cost based navigation server  is illustrative of any suitable computing system (e.g., server computer), capable of sending, receiving, processing, mapping, verifying and storing data according to embodiments of the present invention. The cost based navigation server  may be associated with any one or combination of the communications systems illustrated in the network  for maintaining and processing navigation information, including but not limited to, mapping, routing, locating, as well as, all necessary cost based navigation functionality. The associated database  may be operative for storing user preference data, navigation, and POI information. According to embodiments, the cost based navigation server  and associated database  may be utilized for various navigation technologies and may not be limited to a single navigation company but may be multiple navigation companies. As should be appreciated, these are but a few examples of the many ways cost based navigation may be implemented to an end user based on user preference data and minimizing criteria.","As described briefly above, embodiments of the present invention may provide a user with a more relevant and efficient travel experience by filtering intermediate POI search results based on a calculated total cost and a calculated route deviation cost for each potential intermediate POI according to the user's preferences. Referring now to , a diagram  is illustrated showing a route  from a starting point  to a primary destination . Also shown are various intermediate POIs , ,  and a route deviation cost and total cost associated with each intermediate POI. Consider, for example, a user searches for a restaurant while on a long-distance interstate highway trip. Consider also, that the user has set a deviation cost filter to \u201c2 minutes,\u201d which means that any restaurant more than two minutes from the current route will not be shown.","According to one embodiment, a route deviation cost may be derived from a distance or travel time from an established route  to an intermediate POI , , . For example, still referring to , the distance from the established route  to intermediate POI \u201cA\u201d  may be 5. As should be appreciated, 5 may be an actual number of miles from the established route , or may be a calculated score factoring in the distance from the established route  to the intermediate POI \u201cA\u201d . According to embodiments, a route deviation cost may be a calculated score that factors in other variables such as, but not limited to, a number of right-hand or left-hand turns, type or brand preference of a POI, road class types, urban vs. rural routes, a number of stops, etc. depending on a user's preferences. As shown on , a route deviation cost to intermediate POI \u201cB\u201d  is 2, and a route deviation cost to intermediate POI \u201cC\u201d  is 1.","According to another embodiment, a total cost may be considered for each combination of intermediate POI and end destination . A total cost may be derived from taking the distance from a starting point  or current location to the deviation point (i.e., the point at which traveling to an intermediate POI , ,  would require deviating from the existing route ), and adding that distance to a derived route deviation cost. For example, and still referring to , a total cost for deviating from the existing route  to intermediate POI \u201cA\u201d  would be 2 (distance from the start  to the exit to intermediate POI \u201cA\u201d) plus 5 (route deviation cost previously calculated), equaling a total cost of 7. Using the same calculation, the total cost to intermediate POI \u201cB\u201d is 6, and the total cost to intermediate POI \u201cC\u201d is 13.","According to the present example, the user has set an example deviation cost filter to 2 minutes. Thus, intermediate POI \u201cA\u201d may not be displayed to the user, since the route deviation cost is greater than 2. As should be appreciated, a route deviation cost and a total cost may be calculated in alternative ways. For example, other variables (e.g., a number of right-hand or left-hand turns, type or brand preference, road class type, urban vs. rural route, a number of stops, etc.) may be considered and may be factored into the calculations.","As shown in , filtered intermediate POI search results may be displayed to a user in a variety of ways. For example, according to one embodiment and as illustrated in , a map interface  displaying intermediate POI search results ,  as map points may be displayed. A listing  of intermediate POI search results may or may not be provided. The listing  may be provided alone or in combination with a map interface . The listing  may include a route deviation cost  and a total cost  for each intermediate POI , . According to another embodiment, upon selection of a displayed intermediate POI, a route deviation cost and\/or a total cost may be provided.","Another method, and as illustrated in , may include displaying a map interface  displaying intermediate POI search results ,  as map points, and a message area  displaying a short description of each intermediate POI search result ,  and a distance away to each POI. For example, and as illustrated, a message such as, \u201cA BURGERS & MORE (POI \u201cB\u201d ) IS LOCATED IN 6 MILES AT EXIT 125.\u201d","Another method, and as illustrated in , may include providing a route from a starting point  or current location to a primary destination  displayed on a map interface . When a user searches for an intermediate POI, a selection of POI search results , , , ,  may be plotted on the map interface . As illustrated, a route deviation cost  associated with each intermediate POI may also be displayed. In this example, other features of deviating to a potential POI are factored into each route deviation cost. In this example, distance to an intermediate POI off from the existing route  and a presence of a playground at an intermediate POI is factored in. As illustrated in , an information area  may be provided for listing features that may have contributed to a route deviation cost calculation. Consider, for example, a user specifies that a restaurant with a play area is preferable. The user may also specify that minimizing the distance from an existing route  to an intermediate POI is desirable. Additionally, the user may specify that travel through a road construction zone is highly undesirable. As illustrated, potential intermediate POI 1 \u201cBob's Burgers\u201d  has a route deviation cost of 1. As shown in the information area , Bob's Burgers has a minimal deviation distance  and features a playground . Still referring to the example in , potential intermediate POI 5 \u201cBill's Drive-Thru\u201d  has a route deviation cost of 7. Although Bill's Drive-Thru  has a minimal deviation distance  and a playground , the route deviation cost is the highest of the five displayed POIs , , , , , as a result of a determination that there is road construction  along the route from the established route  to Bill's Drive-Thru .","According to another embodiment, a route  from a starting point  or current location to a primary destination  may be adjusted or altered to minimize a total cost  to travel to both the end destination and an intermediate POI. For example and referring now to , consider a route through an urban area. As illustrated, an intermediate POI \u201cW\u201d  has a least deviation (based on travel distance) from the existing route of travel  to the destination . By shifting the route of travel to an alternate route , the travel distance to the end destination  remains the same; however, now intermediate POI \u201cX\u201d  is along the route  with no deviation required. Thus, the total cost of travel  to intermediate POI \u201cX\u201d  with the alternate routing  is less than the total cost of travel to intermediate POI \u201cW\u201d  with the original route .","According to another embodiment, a deviation cost associated with a combination of intermediate POIs may be provided. For example, a user may wish to deviate from a route  to stop for both food and gas. Search data for both types of intermediate POIs may be input into the navigation system, wherein one or more deviation routes including both types of intermediate POIs may be provided based on a calculated combined route deviation cost and\/or a calculated total cost for each combined intermediate POI deviation route.","Referring now to , a flow diagram of an illustrative method  for providing deviation cost-based filtering of one or more potential intermediate points of interest along a route to a primary destination is shown. The method begins at OPERATION  and proceeds to OPERATION  where user preference data is received. As should be appreciated, it may not be required for user preference data to be input by a user for each use, but may be entered during device set-up or prior to or during travel. According to an embodiment, user preference data may be entered and stored locally on a navigation device , , , , , may be entered locally and stored remotely in a cost based navigation server database  and accessed via a network , or may be entered remotely on a network-connected computing device, stored remotely in a cost based navigation server database , and accessed by a navigation device via a network . As described above, user preference data may include input or selections made by a user specifying one or more preferences a user may have associated with an intermediate POI and\/or travel to an intermediate POI.","According to one embodiment, user preference data may be directed to a specific type of intermediate POI. For example, a user may specify a preference for a certain brand of bank. When a search is initiated by the user for a bank, preference may be given to the brand of bank specified by the user.","According to another embodiment, user preference data may be directed to travel preferences. For example, a user may specify a preference for minimizing fuel consumption when deviating from a planned route  to an intermediate POI. When a search is initiated by the user for a particular intermediate POI, preference may be given to intermediate POIs meeting the search criteria and wherein the route to the intermediate POI has fewer traffic lights, less traffic congestion, lower speed limits, etc.","According to another embodiment, usage data may be gathered, and user preference data may be automatically extracted from usage data. For example, data associated with searches and\/or selections of certain types of POIs (e.g., brand of fuel station or restaurant), selections of routes with common attributes (e.g., routes to POIs that minimize additional travel distances), etc., may be collected, stored, and utilized to present relevant search results to a user.","According to one embodiment, user preference data may include a list of one or more favorite POIs. Information may be provided to the user detailing a distance away or an estimated time away to a nearest each of the one or more favorite POIs. According to another embodiment, map points of one or more favorite POIs may be automatically populated on a map interface .","After user preference data is received or extracted, the method  proceeds to OPERATION  where a route  is generated between a specified starting point  or current location and a primary destination . The generated route  may be determined by a navigation system. As described above, the navigation system may comprise a GPS or other position-determining mechanism, and a cost based navigation server  and database  operable to store and provide maps, POI data, etc. The system may also be operable to receive real-time data, such as traffic information, road construction information, etc. The generated route  may be displayed to a user on a map interface  of the navigation device , , , , , and\/or step-by-step directions may be provided visually or audibly.","The method  proceeds to OPERATION , where search criteria for one or more intermediate POIs are received. As illustrated in , C, and D, a search field  or a selectable functionality button may be provided on a navigation device for receiving search criteria. For example, and as illustrated, a user searching for a restaurant may enter \u201cRESTAURANT\u201d in a search field  to search for restaurants in a given location. Other search criteria may be received, for example, a specific intermediate POI (e.g., SHELL fuel station or MCDONALDS restaurant, etc.), a search for an intermediate POI in a certain radius, within a certain distance, along the generated route , etc. According to one embodiment, one or more areas on a map interface may be selected within which to search for specific or any intermediate POIs. For example, a user may touch on an area of a touch screen map interface, and a bubble or radius may be created. A user may also specify search criteria, such as \u201cGAS,\u201d to locate gas stations within the bubble or radius. As should be appreciated, search criteria may be received via other methods such as via speech input.","At OPERATION , one or more intermediate POIs may be identified based on the received search criteria. For example, if a user searches for a restaurant within a 20 mile radius along a generated route , restaurants within the 20 mile radius and along the generated route  may be identified.","The method  proceeds to OPERATION , where data associated with each of the one or more identified intermediate POIs is retrieved. Data may include, but is not limited to, travel distance to each POI, estimated travel time to each POI, traffic information, road class information, road construction information, traffic flow information (e.g., number of left-hand versus right-hand turns, number of traffic lights or stops, etc.) along a route to each POI, POI name, POI contact information, POI address, type of each POI, brand of each POI, features of each POI (e.g., fast-food vs. sit-down restaurant, pet-friendly POIs, POI with a play area, POIs serving alcoholic beverages, etc.), etc.","According to one embodiment, once data associated with each of the one or more identified intermediate POIs is retrieved, the method  proceeds to OPERATION , where one or more possible alternative routes  to the primary destination  are identified. At OPERATION , a cost associated with a deviation to each of the one or more identified intermediate POIs along the one or more possible alternative routes  may be calculated.","According to another embodiment, alternative routes may not be considered. After data associated with each of the one or more identified intermediate POIs is retrieved at OPERATION , the method  may proceed to OPERATION  where a cost associated with a deviation from the generated route  to each of the one or more identified intermediate POIs is calculated. According to embodiments, a route deviation cost  may be calculated, the route deviation cost factoring in cost penalties according to user preference data. Additionally, a total cost  may also be calculated. As described above, a total cost may be derived by taking the distance from a starting point  or current location to the deviation point (i.e., the point at which traveling to an intermediate POI would require deviating from the existing route ), and adding that distance to a calculated route deviation cost .","After a cost to each of the one or more identified intermediate POIs is calculated at OPERATION  or OPERATION , the method  proceeds to OPERATION , where identified intermediate POIs may be filtered. According to embodiments, the identified intermediate POIs may be filtered according to a calculated route deviation cost . According to one embodiment, intermediate POIs with a route deviation cost  equal to or greater than a specified number may be filtered out. For example, referring back to , the intermediate POI \u201cA\u201d  may be filtered out if a specification is made to filter out identified POIs with a route deviation cost  greater than or equal to 5.","According to another embodiment, a specified number of identified intermediate POIs may be presented to a user. For example, if is specification is made to provide five intermediate POI search results to a user, the five identified intermediate POIs with the lowest route deviation costs may be presented. Filtering criteria (e.g., specified value of deviation cost to filter out, specified number of intermediate POIs to present, etc.) may be set by a user, or may be a default value.","According to an embodiment, identified intermediate POIs may be filtered according to a weighted filter based on a type or brand of intermediate POI. For example, a user may be willing to deviate no more than one mile for a MCDONALDS, but may be willing to deviate up to three miles for a SUBWAY. As should be appreciated, identified intermediate POIs may be filtered according to a weighted filter based on other criteria as specified by a user.","At OPERATION , one or more filtered identified intermediate POIs may be presented to a user. As described above with reference to , C, and D, filtered identified intermediate POIs may be presented in a variety of ways including, but not limited to, displaying POIs on a map interface and providing a listing of POIs with or without route deviation costs and\/or total costs.","Once filtered identified intermediate POIs are presented to a user, the user may select one or more of the presented POIs, wherein the established route  may be modified to accommodate the new one or more intermediate POIs. The method  ends at OPERATION .",{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0053","num":"0052"},"figref":["FIG. 6","FIG. 6"],"b":["600","270","275","600","215","220","225","230","235","270","275"]},"Computing devices are implemented in different ways in different embodiments.
