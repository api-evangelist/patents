title: Correlating operational states and battery usage of devices to extend battery duration
abstract: A plurality of client devices may each run on battery power and each experience respective battery usage while in a respective operational state. A server may receive, from the plurality of client devices, a plurality of reports correlating the client devices' respective operational states with the client devices' respective battery usage. Based on the reports, the server may identify at least two client devices in the plurality that reported a common operational state. The server may further determine a representative battery usage for the common operational state, and use this representative battery usage to predict battery usage for a particular client device that is in the common operational state. Then, the server may instruct the particular client device to take an action based upon the predicted battery usage.

{"@attributes":{"id":"description"},"BRFSUM":[{},{}],"heading":["BACKGROUND","OVERVIEW","DESCRIPTION","I. Example Network Architecture","II. Example Computing Device","III. Example Measurements and Reports","IV. Example Methods","V. Conclusion"],"p":["Battery-operated client devices, such as cell phones, tablet computers, and e-book readers, have become general-purpose computing platforms. As a result, these client devices allow users to download and operate various applications developed by third parties. Often, there is no entity verifying that these third parties use efficient programming techniques. Consequently, some third-party applications will have a disproportionate and deleterious impact on the battery duration of client devices.","In the past, some classes of battery-operated client devices offered few, if any, third-party applications. Thus, the battery duration of these devices was relatively predictable. Today, this is not the case. Application stores and markets host hundreds of thousands of downloadable applications for cell phones, tablet computers, e-book readers, and other types of devices. Based on the resources consumed by these applications, the efficiency with which the applications were programmed, and patterns of application use, each application may exhibit a battery usage profile. However, when a new application is released, this battery usage profile may not be apparent.","For example, if a user installs a new game on her cell phone, the game might drain the cell phone's battery level from 70% to 10% in less than an hour of operation. This behavior can be problematic, as the user might need to make a critical phone call, but the cell phone may not have sufficient battery duration to support the full length of the call. Such situations are especially problematic when the user does not have access to the appropriate adapters and\/or power outlets to recharge the cell phone.","Further, some settings on certain client devices might also use a disproportionate amount of battery power. For instance, bright screen displays and use of certain network interfaces can rapidly drain battery capacity. Thus, it can be advantageous for a user to be made aware of applications and settings on his or her client device that are causing, or may cause, excessive battery usage.","Sometimes, users find out about battery-draining applications and settings through word of mouth, perhaps from friends, co-workers, or via the Internet. However, this information is anecdotal at best, and may not be reliable. As more and more client devices and applications reach the market, the robustness of word-of-mouth distribution of this information is likely to decrease even further.","Example embodiments herein describe a systematic way of determining how specific applications and settings, on particular client devices, impact battery usage. At least some of these embodiments employ \u201ccrowd-sourcing,\u201d in which information is gathered from a potentially large number of client devices. This information may include measurements, or samples, of the respective operational states of these client devices, and their respective battery levels. These operational states, which may include the applications operating on the client device and the settings of the client device, are then correlated with the battery level measurements to determine which operational states have a significant impact on battery duration.","Based on this information, the client device may terminate one or more applications or change one or more settings on the client device in order to reduce battery usage. Alternatively or additionally, the client device may inform the user of applications and\/or settings that may be responsible for disproportionately high battery usage so that the user can decide whether to terminate the applications and\/or change the settings. By gathering this information across a number of client devices and\/or over a period of time, a more reliable estimation of the impact that applications and settings have on battery life may be determined.","Accordingly, in an example embodiment, a plurality of client devices in a network communication system may each run on battery power and each experience respective battery usage while in a respective operational state. A server may receive, from the plurality of client devices, a plurality of reports correlating the client devices' respective operational states with the client devices' respective battery usage. Based on the received reports, the server may identify at least two client devices in the plurality that reported a common operational state. The server may statistically determine a representative battery usage for the common operational state based on the reported battery usage for the common operational state of the at least two client devices. The server may also use the representative battery usage for the common operational state as a basis to predict battery usage for a particular client device that is in the common operational state, and may instruct the particular client device to take an action based upon the predicted battery usage.","In another example embodiment, a battery manager may be operating on a client device. The battery manager may make a plurality of measurements of respective battery levels of the client device. Each of the measurements may be associated with respective data that includes a respective set of one or more applications operating on the client device and respective settings of the client device. The battery manager may transmit a report of the plurality of measurements and associated data to a server. Perhaps in response to transmitting the report, the battery manager may receive a message from the server. The message may instruct the battery manager to take an action to reduce battery usage by the client device. Possibly in response to receiving the message, the battery manager may initiate the action to reduce battery usage by the client device.","These and other aspects and advantages will become apparent to those of ordinary skill in the art by reading the following detailed description, with reference where appropriate to the accompanying drawings. Further, it should be understood that this overview and other description throughout this document is merely for purposes of example and is not intended to limit the scope of the invention as claimed.",{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0019","num":"0018"},"figref":"FIG. 1","b":["100","102","104","106"]},"Each of these devices may be capable of communicating, using wireline or wireless technologies, over communication infrastructure . Thus, communication infrastructure  may facilitate this communication by providing signaling and\/or bearer traffic paths between any of client devices , , and , as well as server device . Additionally, some or all of these devices may be capable of communication, via communication infrastructure  or another network or networks, with other devices.","Thus, client devices , , and  could be cell phones, tablet computers, e-book readers, laptop computers, personal digital assistants, or another type of wired or wireless device. In some embodiments, these client devices may be subscriber devices that are manipulated by a human in order to establish voice, video, and\/or multimedia sessions with one another and with other devices. However, these devices could also be automated devices without a human interface.","Communication infrastructure  may be one or more networks that support access from wireline devices, wireless devices, or both. Thus, communication infrastructure  may include one or more connections to the public Internet and\/or private IP networks, or may itself be distributed across various physical or topological locations on the public Internet and\/or private IP networks.","As such, communication infrastructure  may contain various types of routers, switches, gateways, firewalls, and servers. These elements, as well as client devices , , and , may be coupled by wireline communication link technologies such as Ethernet, Token Ring, Synchronous Optical Networking (SONET), Asynchronous Transfer Mode (ATM), digital subscriber line (DSL), broadband cable television, or one or more of the various T-carrier systems.

In order to facilitate a range of services, communication infrastructure  may comprise multiple physical and\/or logical components associated with telephony services. For example, communication infrastructure  may include one or more base stations radiating to define wireless coverage areas, base station controllers, mobile switching centers, access gateways, authentication servers, and so on. To support multimedia services, communication infrastructure  may also include one or more of a call session control function, a signaling gateway, a media gateway control function, a media gateway, a home subscriber server, as well as various application servers and\/or downloadable application logic.","Server device  may be a standalone or integrated device, and may be communicatively coupled to communication infrastructure , as shown in . Alternatively, server device  may be part of communication infrastructure . Server device  may be a personal computer, a standalone server, a blade server, a database, or another type of device. Server device  may take the form of a single physical device, or may be divided into multiple logical components spanning a number of physical devices.","The description of the elements in  is merely introductory and should not be interpreted to limit the characteristics and functions of these devices. Accordingly, it should be understood that this and other arrangements and processes described herein are set forth for purposes of example only. Thus, other arrangements and elements (e.g., machines, interfaces, functions, orders of elements, etc.) can be added or used instead and some elements may be omitted altogether. Further, as in most communication architectures, those skilled in the art will appreciate that many of the elements described herein are functional entities that may be implemented as discrete components or in conjunction with other components, in any suitable combination or location.",{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0027","num":"0026"},"figref":"FIG. 2","b":["200","200","100","102","104","106"]},"Computing device  may include a processor , data storage , network interface , and input\/output function , all of which may be coupled by a system bus  or a similar mechanism. Processor  may include one or more central processing units (CPUs), such as one or more general purpose processors and\/or one or more dedicated processors (e.g., application specific integrated circuits (ASICs) or digital signal processors (DSPs), etc.)","Data storage , in turn, may comprise volatile and\/or non-volatile data storage and can be integrated in whole or in part with processor . Data storage  may store program instructions, executable by processor , and data that are manipulated by these instructions to carry out the various methods, processes, or functions described herein. Alternatively, these methods, processes, or functions can be defined by hardware, firmware, and\/or any combination of hardware, firmware and software. Therefore, data storage  may be a tangible, non-transitory computer-readable medium, having stored thereon program instructions that, upon execution by one or more processors, cause computing device  to carry out any of the methods, processes, or functions disclosed in this specification or the accompanying drawings.","Network interface  may take the form of a wireline connection, such as an Ethernet, Token Ring, or T-carrier connection. Network interface  may also take the form of a wireless connection, such as Wifi, BLUETOOTH\u00ae, or a wide-area wireless connection. However, other forms of physical layer connections and other types of standard or proprietary communication protocols may be used over network interface . Furthermore, network interface  may comprise multiple physical communication interfaces.","Input\/output function  may facilitate user interaction with example computing device . Input\/output function  may comprise multiple types of input devices, such as a keyboard, a mouse, a touch screen, a microphone, and\/or any other device that is capable of receiving input from a user. Similarly, input\/output function  may comprise multiple types of output devices, such as a display, printer, one or more light emitting diodes (LEDs), speaker, or any other device that is capable of providing output discernible to a user. Additionally or alternatively, example computing device  may support remote access from another device, via network interface  or via another interface (not shown), such an RS-232 or Universal Serial Bus (USB) port.","As noted above, any of client devices , , and\/or  may be battery-operated devices, such as a cell phone, tablet computer, laptop computer, or e-book reader. Many of these types of devices may incorporate a general-purpose operating system, which may allow users to download and execute various third-party applications. While some of these applications may have a minimal impact on client devices, others may make extensive use of the processing and\/or communication capabilities of the client devices. As a result, some applications may result in excessive and disproportionate battery usage.","One class of applications that tend to drain battery power rapidly is games. Many games employ sophisticated graphics that require extensive processing resources. Further, while these games are being played, the screen of the client device is usually on, which may result in additional battery drain.","However, if may be difficult for a user of a client device to determine which applications cause the client device's battery to drain. For example, a user may install dozens of applications on a cell phone. While some of these applications may operate only when explicitly invoked, others may operate continuously \u201cin the background\u201d and\/or periodically. For example, an email application may be idle for a period of time, become active to check and download new emails from the user's email accounts, then become idle again.","The user might not even be aware which applications operate periodically or in the background, as these applications might not provide the user with any indication that they are operating in such a manner. Consequently, the client device's battery may drain rapidly without the user necessarily knowing the cause. The user might instead believe that the client device itself is either poorly-designed or defective.","Moreover, some applications may unintentionally put a strain on client devices' batteries. An application may be inefficiently programmed, or have defects (bugs) that cause the application to use more processing and\/or network resources than anticipated. For example the application might have a defect that, from time to time, causes the application to enter an endless loop in its program logic. From the user's perspective, the client device might seem to randomly lose some or all of its battery life.","In addition to applications, the settings of a client device can have an impact on battery usage. Many modern client devices include several network interfaces. For example, a cell phone might have Wifi, BLUETOOTH\u00ae, near field communication (NFC), 3generation wide-area wireless (3G), and\/or 4generation wide-area wireless (4G) interfaces. Some of these interfaces, when activated, may periodically attempt to communicate with a network. If network coverage is poor, the client device may use a significant amount of battery power when doing so.","Also, the screen brightness of the client device can negatively impact battery duration. In general, the brighter the screen of a battery-powered client device, the more the client device will use its battery power. Thus, turning down the brightness of the client device's screen, and\/or blanking out the screen after a period of non-use, may increase the device's battery life.",{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0039","num":"0038"},"figref":"FIG. 3","b":["300","302","304","306","300","302","304","306"]},"For sake of example, it is assumed that points , , , and  are equidistant in time. Thus, for instance, there may be an hour of time elapsed between each of these points. However, the applications operating on a client device can be sampled more or less frequently. For example, the sampling may occur once every few seconds or once every few minutes. Further, while the samples in  are taken periodically, samples could instead be taken aperiodically, such as in response to a triggering event.","At point , the client device has a battery level of 90%. Over time, as long as the client device is not charged, this battery level will decrease based on the client device's operational state. Thus, at point , the battery level has decreased to about 82%. However, between point  and point , the battery level decreased from about 82% to 60%. At point , the battery level has decreased from 60% to 55%.","It may be possible to compare the applications operating on the client device at these points to the respective different battery decreases for each point to estimate the impact of applications on battery usage. For example, just the email and social networking applications are operating at point , and the battery level decreased only 5% between points  and . From this information, it appears that the email and social networking applications have a relatively minor impact on battery life. However, at points  and  the email, social networking and game applications are operating, and the battery level decreased by over 20%.","From this information, it can be inferred that the game application has a disproportionate impact on battery usage, in comparison to the email, social networking, and web applications. Namely, in the period when the game application was operating (from point  to point ), a large decrease in battery level was observed. However, the game application was not operating the full time of the other two periods (from point  to point  and from point  to point ), and the battery level decreased far less during these periods.","It should be noted that in the example illustrated in , it is possible that between points  and  the game application was terminated and the battery drain during this point was due to the operation of some other application. Therefore, conclusions drawn about the game application's impact on battery usage based on these samples are estimates. In practice, however, the applications operating on a client device may be sampled more frequently than once every 10 minutes to reduce the likelihood and impact of sampling bias. Further, gathering this information across a large number of client devices (as discussed below) and analyzing this information in aggregate will also reduce the likelihood and impact of sampling bias.","Similarly to how the chart in  shows samples of applications operating on a client device, the settings of a client device can also be sampled. As described above, the settings may include the states of various network interfaces and screen brightness. The settings may also include any other option that is configurable by the client device or its applications, such as the frequency that an email application checks for new messages, ringtone volume, when the client device displays audible, visual, or motion-based notifications or alarms, whether voice calls are made using the public switched telephone network or VoIP, and so on. Further, the applications operating on a client device and the settings of the client device may be sampled at about the same time, or at different times, by the same mechanism, or by different mechanisms.",{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0046","num":"0045"},"figref":["FIG. 4","FIG. 4","FIG. 4"],"b":["100","400","402","404","406","408","400","402","404","406","408","410"]},"Battery manager  may measure battery levels of client device , and may gather information about the applications operating on client device . Thus, for instance, battery manager  may query the operating system of client device  to determine that application A , application B , and application C  are operating on client device . Alternatively or additionally, these applications may indicate to battery manager  when they are operating. Battery manager  may also read client device settings  from time to time. Thus, for example, the samples shown in  may be gathered by battery manager . Once battery manager  has gathered this information, it may format, store, and\/or report this information to another device.","Battery manager  may be a standalone application that is built into or downloadable to client device . Alternatively, battery manager  may be a component of the operating system of client device . Also, battery manager  may have access to one or more application programming interfaces, or other mechanisms, through which it can determine the battery level of client device .","While using data from, e.g., battery manager  to analyze samples of the operational states of a single client device may be useful, gathering such samples from a number of client devices (perhaps a large number of client devices) may facilitate a more accurate analysis. With a large sample size, broader trends of correlations between operational states and battery usage across various makes and models of client devices may be able to be determined.","Further, the data in these samples can be examined to determine when two or more client devices share a common operational state (e.g., when these client devices are running the same applications and\/or have at least some of same settings configured). Based on the reported battery usage for the common operational state, a representative battery usage for the common operational state may be statistically determined. For instance, suppose that a number of devices all report a battery level decrease similar to that illustrated in  when operating the same email, social networking, and game applications. Then, a conclusion can be drawn, with some degree of statistical confidence, that other devices operating the same combination of applications will experience the same or a similar battery level decrease.","Once this analysis has been performed, individual client devices can be instructed to take specific steps that may reduce battery utilization. For instance, a client device might be instructed to terminate and\/or uninstall a gaming application, turn off a wireless interface, or to lower its screen brightness. Alternatively, the client device might be instructed to notify the user of the client device of which applications and\/or settings are deemed to be having the most negative impact on battery duration. Then the user can decide whether to terminate and\/or uninstall the applications or change the settings.","In some embodiments, each of the various applications operating on a client device might be assigned a priority. This priority may reflect how important the application is to the operation of the client device and\/or to the client device's user. Thus, for example, a game might be given a relatively low priority (e.g., below a priority threshold), while a phone application or a web browser might be given a relatively high priority (e.g., above the priority threshold).","The priority of an application may be taken into account when providing instructions to the client device, and\/or when the client device determines how to process the instruction. For example, a cell phone's phone application could be assigned the highest possible priority. Thus, even if this application is consuming a disproportionate amount of battery power, the client device may refrain from terminating the application. On the other hand, a game application operating on the same cell phone might be given the lowest priority, and could be subject to termination even if it is using less battery power than the phone application.","Moreover, the analysis can be conducted separately for devices of specific makes and models. Thus, to the extent that the same operational states produce different patterns of battery usage on different types of client devices, these differences can be determined, device-specific instructions can be given, and device-specific recommendations can be made.","In order to facilitate the analysis of a potentially large amount of data from numerous client devices, the client devices may report samples of their respective operational states and battery levels to a server, such as server device . This server may be centrally-located or distributed across two or more locations.",{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0056","num":"0055"},"figref":"FIG. 5","b":["106","500","100","400","502","100","106","504","102","506","106"]},"At step , server device  may identify that client device  and  have reported a common operational state (e.g., the client devices had the same set, or a similar set, of operating applications or settings configured). From these reports, server device  may determine a representative battery usage for the common operational state. Server device may  may also predict respective battery usages for client devices  and .","At step , server device  may transmit an instruction to client device . The instruction might instruct client device  to take a particular action based on its predicted battery usage. Then, at step , client device  may take this action. Similarly, at step , server device  may transmit an instruction to client device . This instruction might instruct client device  to take a particular action based on the predicted battery usage of client device , and at step  client device  may take this action.","For instance, if the action is to terminate an application, the client device may do so. Alternatively or additionally, if the action is to warn the user that the application has a disproportionate impact on battery power, the client device may do so. The instruction might also provide the client device an estimate of the client device's expected battery duration based on the client device's current operational state, and the client device might provide this information to the user. For example, if server device  estimates that client device  has only 10 minutes of battery duration remaining in its current operational state, server device might notify client device  of this estimate. Then, client device  may provide a visual, auditory, motion-based, or another type of indication to the user, warning him or her of this estimate. The user would then know that they might not be able to make a long phone call without making at least some changes to the applications and\/or settings of client device .","Although the message flow of  involves only two client devices, the embodiment depicted in , other embodiments similar thereto, may involve hundreds, thousands, or millions of client devices. Further, these embodiments may include other messages and\/or processing that does not appear in .","For situations in which the devices and\/or systems discussed here collect information about users (e.g., the applications and settings used by such users), the users may be provided with an opportunity to opt in or out of programs or features that may collect such information. In addition, certain data may be anonymized before it is stored or used, so that personally identifiable information is removed. For example, a user's identity may be anonymized so that the no personally identifiable information can be determined for the user and so that any identified user preferences or user interactions are generalized (for example, generalized based on user demographics) rather than associated with a particular user. As a result, any information collected or stored, for example, by server device , may be arranged not to reveal the identity, preferences, or usage patterns of any particular user.",{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0062","num":"0061"},"figref":["FIG. 6","FIG. 6"],"b":["106","600"]},"At step , based on the received reports, at least two client devices in the plurality that reported a common operational state may be identified.
