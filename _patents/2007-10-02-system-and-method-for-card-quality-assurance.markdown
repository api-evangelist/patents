{"@attributes":{"id":"description"},"RELAPP":[{},{}],"heading":["CROSS-REFERENCE TO RELATED APPLICATION","BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION","SUMMARY OF THE INVENTION","DETAILED DESCRIPTION OF THE INVENTION"],"p":["This application is a continuation of International Application PCT\/US06\/012289, filed Apr. 4, 2006, which claims the benefit of U.S. provisional patent application No. 60\/668,306 filed on Apr. 4, 2005, each of which is incorporated by reference in its entirety herein.","A \u201csmart\u201d payment card is a type of plastic card embedded with a computer chip that stores and transacts data between users. The computer chip includes a microprocessor and memory, or only a memory chip with non-programmable logic. The data is associated with either value or information or both and is stored and processed within the card's chip. The card data is transacted via a reader that is part of a computing system. It can contain more data than a magnetic stripe card and can be programmed to reveal only the relevant information. For example, it could tell a device in a store that there is sufficient balance in an account to pay for a transaction without revealing the balance amount. Encryption techniques secure the data, and the processor allows it to be programmed for different applications. Smart cards are now widely deployed, for example, in healthcare, banking, entertainment and transportation industries. There are two general categories of smart cards: contact and contactless smart cards. A contact smart card requires insertion into a smart card reader with a direct connection to a conductive micromodule on the surface of the card. It is via these physical contact points, that transmission of commands, data, and card status takes place. A contactless card requires only close proximity to a reader. Both the reader and the card have matching radiofrequency antennas providing a contactless electromagnetic link by which the two can communicate.","The smart cards are fabricated, for example, by embedding a micro module into the plastic substrate or card. Contactless smart cards may be fabricated by laminating the antenna\/chip module between top and bottom card layers. The antenna is typically 3-5 turns of very thin wire or conductive ink connected to the contactless chip.","The industrial fabrication and the properties of smart cards are subject to voluntary industry standards. A basic smart card standard is the ISO 7816 series, part 1-10. These standards are derived from the financial ID card standards and detail the physical, electrical, mechanical, and application programming interface to a contact chip card. For example, the ISO 7816-1 Standard limits the physical size of the card. The card is the ID-1 size: (85.6 mm\u00d754.0 mm\u00d776 mm). This is the same size as a bank credit card. The standard includes accommodation of exposure limits for a number of electromagnetic phenomena such as X-rays, UV light, electromagnetic fields, static electrical fields, and ambient temperature of the card. Furthermore, ISO 7816-1 defines the mechanical characteristics of a card (e.g., when it is bent or flexed) to make sure that plastic cards with embedded chips and antennas are manufactured in a way that guarantees flawless operation over the expected lifetime of a card.","Smart cards deployed, for example, in the payment-by-card industry, also may include features such as magnetic stripes and embossed lettering, so that the cards are operable with legacy payment infrastructure such as magnetic stripe card readers and embossed card paper imprinters that are still in use in the field. Embossing allows for textual information or designs on the card to be transferred to paper by using a simple and inexpensive device. ISO 7811 specifies the embossed marks, covering their form, size, embossing height, and positioning. Use of magnetic stripe technology advantageously reduces the flood of paper documents associated with embossing. ISO 7811 also specifies the properties of the magnetic stripe, coding techniques, and positioning.","The smart cards, may be fabricated by laminating a foil or inlay, which, for example, supports a chip and antenna, into a PVC plastic card. A laminating press may be used adjust the pressure applied to the cards. Too much pressure on a contactless inlay can break the antenna, rendering the contactless feature useless.","Consideration is now being given to ways of providing solutions for improving card fabrication. Attention is directed to reducing variations in the physical properties of the cards consistent with commonly accepted standards. In particular, attention is directed to improving standard compliance procedures.","The invention provides a system and method for payment card quality assurance. The system and method use a grid or similar graphic to optically accentuate card surface feature or deformations. The system and method may be used to qualify card-manufacturing processes. The invention allows for identification, prior to volume manufacture, of a deformation in the card that may result in unacceptable quality cards.","The grid or similar graphic enables a generic test that checks the quality across the whole card. This whole card testing can replace multiple tests for each card specific graphic, thus reducing testing time and costs.","Further features of the invention, its nature and various advantages will be more apparent from the accompanying drawings and the following detailed description.","The present invention provides a system and method for payment card quality assurance (QA). This system and method employ a grid pattern or similar pattern, which optically amplifies or accentuates surface features, for the inspecting the surfaces of product payment cards.  shows an exemplary grid pattern . Grid pattern  preferably blankets the entire card surface, which allows the entire card surface to be inspected for defects or deformation quickly, for example, in plan view.","The grid pattern may be designed to exploit diffraction, lenticular, or other optical phenomena for amplification of the surface features. The grid pattern may be applied to the surfaces of the subject test cards using an adhesive tape or sticker. Alternatively the grid-like pattern may be generated by optical elements (e.g., screens) in a plan view optical inspection system.","In an exemplary application of the invention, process monitor cards are processed through same fabrication steps used for product payment cards. (See e.g. , process monitor card ). The process monitor cards are fabricated to have a surface grid pattern  or similar pattern, which optically amplifies surface features. The grid pattern or other similar pattern makes plan view inspection of surface defects easier. The process monitor cards may be used to qualify the fabrication process to ensure that the product payment cards fabricated by the process are in compliance with standard industry or any other desired product specifications.","An exemplary application of the inventive QA system and method is described herein with reference to the manufacture of contactless or proximity-only payment cards that are fabricated by laminating an inlay together with plastic sheets. The process monitor cards may be fabricated, for example, by using a plastic sheet that has a printed or built in grid pattern as an overlay sheet in the laminate.","The inlay, which may be a discrete or virtual layer inside the payment card, carries an antenna and the integrated circuit module (PICC). The design of the inlay may be according to ID-1 specifications. A product specification may, for example, define acceptable card thickness outside embossed areas and add-on areas. The thickness of the inlay is such that it allows the generation of a card within a defined product specification.","The antenna and the PICC are geometrically laid out to avoid card areas that are designated for other card features, such as embossed characters, holograms, magnetic stripes, etc.  show graphically the specification parameters for the location of the antenna and the PICC module, respectively. With reference to these figures, Tables II and II show exemplary values for the specification parameters for the antenna and PICC module layout respectively.",{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0021","num":"0020"},"tables":{"@attributes":{"id":"TABLE-US-00001","num":"00001"},"table":{"@attributes":{"frame":"none","colsep":"0","rowsep":"0"},"tgroup":[{"@attributes":{"align":"left","colsep":"0","rowsep":"0","cols":"1"},"colspec":{"@attributes":{"colname":"1","colwidth":"217pt","align":"center"}},"thead":{"row":[{"entry":"TABLE I"},{"entry":{"@attributes":{"namest":"1","nameend":"1","align":"center","rowsep":"1"}}},{"entry":"Layout Specifications for Antenna Exclusion Area"},{"entry":{"@attributes":{"namest":"1","nameend":"1","align":"center","rowsep":"1"}}}]},"tbody":{"@attributes":{"valign":"top"},"row":{"entry":{}}}},{"@attributes":{"align":"left","colsep":"0","rowsep":"0","cols":"4"},"colspec":[{"@attributes":{"colname":"1","colwidth":"21pt","align":"left"}},{"@attributes":{"colname":"2","colwidth":"133pt","align":"left"}},{"@attributes":{"colname":"3","colwidth":"42pt","align":"char","char":"."}},{"@attributes":{"colname":"4","colwidth":"21pt","align":"char","char":"."}}],"tbody":{"@attributes":{"valign":"top"},"row":[{"entry":["e1","Distance from the left edge of the card to","6.13 +","6.13"]},{"entry":[{},"the left edge of the antenna exclusion area","(2.54*n]",{}]},{"entry":["e\u20321","Id, first character of Name and address area","8.67","8.67"]},{"entry":[{},"not printed",{},{}]},{"entry":["e2","Distance from the left edge of the card to","76.50","8.9"]},{"entry":[{},"the right edge of the antenna exclusion area",{},{}]},{"entry":["h1","Distance from the bottom of the card to the","24.03","ns"]},{"entry":[{},"bottom edge of the antenna exclusion area",{},{}]},{"entry":["h2","Distance from the bottom of the card to the","6.04","6.04"]},{"entry":[{},"top edge of the antenna exclusion area",{},{}]},{"entry":[{},"(fourth line shall not be used)r",{},{}]},{"entry":["h\u20322","Distance from the bottom of the card to the","9.63","9.63"]},{"entry":[{},"top edge of the antenna exclusion area",{},{}]},{"entry":[{},"(third and fourth lines shall not be used)r"]},{"entry":{"@attributes":{"namest":"1","nameend":"4","align":"center","rowsep":"1"}}}]}}]}}},{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0022","num":"0021"},"tables":{"@attributes":{"id":"TABLE-US-00002","num":"00002"},"table":{"@attributes":{"frame":"none","colsep":"0","rowsep":"0"},"tgroup":[{"@attributes":{"align":"left","colsep":"0","rowsep":"0","cols":"1"},"colspec":{"@attributes":{"colname":"1","colwidth":"217pt","align":"center"}},"thead":{"row":[{"entry":"TABLE II"},{"entry":{"@attributes":{"namest":"1","nameend":"1","align":"center","rowsep":"1"}}},{"entry":"Layout Specifications for PICC Exclusion Area"},{"entry":{"@attributes":{"namest":"1","nameend":"1","align":"center","rowsep":"1"}}}]},"tbody":{"@attributes":{"valign":"top"},"row":{"entry":{}}}},{"@attributes":{"align":"left","colsep":"0","rowsep":"0","cols":"4"},"colspec":[{"@attributes":{"colname":"1","colwidth":"28pt","align":"left"}},{"@attributes":{"colname":"2","colwidth":"147pt","align":"left"}},{"@attributes":{"colname":"3","colwidth":"21pt","align":"char","char":"."}},{"@attributes":{"colname":"4","colwidth":"21pt","align":"left"}}],"tbody":{"@attributes":{"valign":"top"},"row":[{"entry":["m1","Distance from the top of the card to the top","18.79","maxi"]},{"entry":[{},"of the PICC module exclusion area",{},{}]},{"entry":["m2","Distance from the bottom of the card to the","6.04","maxi"]},{"entry":[{},"bottom of the PICC module exclusion area [3",{},{}]},{"entry":[{},"lines embossed on the address area]",{},{}]},{"entry":["m\u20322","Distance from the bottom of the card to the","9.63","maxi"]},{"entry":[{},"bottom of the PICC module exclusion area [2",{},{}]},{"entry":[{},"lines embossed on the address area]",{},{}]},{"entry":["n1","Distance from the left edge of the card to","5.15","maxi"]},{"entry":[{},"the left edge of the PICC module exclusion area",{},{}]},{"entry":["n2","Distance from the left edge of the card to","82.12","mini"]},{"entry":[{},"the right edge of the PICC module exclusion area",{},{}]},{"entry":["n3","Height definition of the ICC Contact area","24.03","mini"]},{"entry":[{},"available for PICC module location",{},{}]},{"entry":["n4","Width definition of the ICC Contact area","25.00","mini"]},{"entry":[{},"available for PICC module location",{},{}]},{"entry":["p","Reverse side: Distance from the right edge","25.00","mini"]},{"entry":[{},"of the signature panel to the right edge of the card"]},{"entry":{"@attributes":{"namest":"1","nameend":"4","align":"center","rowsep":"1"}}},{"entry":"where ml => ICC contact area;"},{"entry":"m2 => embossing area;"},{"entry":"n1 => ICC contact area;"},{"entry":"n2 => hologram;"},{"entry":"n3 => embossing area;
