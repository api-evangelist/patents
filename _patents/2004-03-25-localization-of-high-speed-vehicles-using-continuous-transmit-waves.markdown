title: Localization of high speed vehicles using continuous transmit waves
abstract: The selection of multiple, suitably designed, demodulation reference signals can enable the measurement of a vehicle's speed using continuously transmitted frequency modulated (CTFM) signals. The unique solution of vehicle speed can be used to resolve the range Doppler ambiguity found in conventional CTFM sonar and radar systems. This can enable continuous range and speed estimates of high-speed vehicles with an attendant reduction in transmit power relative to pulse-echo systems with similar measures of performance due to the 100% duty cycle.

The U.S. Government may have rights in the disclosed methods and systems.","The systems and methods relate to vehicle detection, and more particularly to vehicle localization using continuously transmitted frequency modulated signals.","A sonar (or radar) system that is capable of continuously transmitting and receiving Continuous Wave (CW) signals can determine a vehicle's speed by measuring the Doppler shift but cannot measure range. If the continuous transmission is frequency modulated and the vehicle is stationary, the range to the vehicle may be determined by measuring the frequency difference between the transmitted signal and the received echo. This concept is used quite extensively in altimeters, police radars, Doppler navigators, and personnel motion detectors (Radar Handbook, McGraw-Hill, M. I. Skolnik, editor). Past techniques to obtain the difference frequency have used the transmitted signal waveform as the demodulating signal.","However, if the vehicle is moving, the instantaneous difference between the transmitted and received echo is dependent on range, range rate and, to a lesser degree, time. The interdependency results in range Doppler ambiguity found in conventional continuously transmitted frequency modulated (CTFM) sonar and radar systems. While Pulse-Echo (PE) sonar\/radar systems have been developed for determining speed and range of target vehicles, such systems typically require significantly higher peak power than CTFM systems with equivalent detection and localization performance because the PE system typically operate at low duty cycle whereas as a CTFM system works at or near 100% duty cycle. Thus, CTFM can have the advantage of requiring substantially lower transmitted power and correspondingly smaller transmitters than equivalent performance PE systems. A CTFM system can also provide faster update rates. Thus, a CTFM system that can resolve the range Doppler ambiguity can have significant advantages over known PE systems.","Systems and methods described herein can provide for the selection of multiple, suitably designed, demodulation reference signals enabling the measurement of a vehicle's speed without ambiguity due to range of separation using continuously transmitted frequency modulated (CTFM) signals. The unique solution of vehicle speed can then be used to resolve the range Doppler ambiguity found in conventional CTFM sonar and radar systems. This disambiguation can enable continuous range and speed estimates of high-speed vehicles with an attendant reduction in transmit power relative to pulse-echo systems with similar measures of performance due to the 100% duty cycle of the CTFM system.","In one embodiment, a method of localizing a target can include transmitting a continuous waveform signal, receiving an echo signal from the target, demodulating the echo signal to a baseband, estimating a rangewise Mach number, M, based on combining energy in cells along hypothesized tracks of a frequency-time diagram for the echo signal, and determining a first range of the target based on the estimated rangewise Mach number.","The method can include estimating a rangewise Mach number by choosing a frequency detection binwidth, \u03b4f, for the cells from the relationship:",{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0010","num":"0009"},"maths":{"@attributes":{"id":"MATH-US-00001","num":"00001"},"math":{"@attributes":{"overflow":"scroll"},"mrow":{"mrow":{"mrow":[{"mi":"\u03b4","mo":["\u2062","\u2062"],"mstyle":{"mspace":{"@attributes":{"width":"0.3em","height":"0.3ex"}}},"msub":{"mi":["f","min"]}},{"mfrac":[{"msub":{"mi":["B","min"]},"mi":"Q"},{"mrow":{"mn":"4","mo":["\u2062","\u2062"],"msub":{"mi":["M","r"]},"mi":"Q"},"mi":"T"}],"mo":"="}],"mo":"="},"mo":","}}},"br":{},"ul":{"@attributes":{"id":"ul0001","list-style":"none"},"li":{"@attributes":{"id":"ul0001-0001","num":"0000"},"ul":{"@attributes":{"id":"ul0002","list-style":"none"},"li":["Bis the minimum bandwidth of the continuous waveform signal, and","Q is the number of cells in a cycle time, T."]}}}},"The method can include estimating a rangewise Mach number using matched filters having a minimum baseband frequency resolution, \u03b4f, of:",{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0012","num":"0013"},"maths":{"@attributes":{"id":"MATH-US-00002","num":"00002"},"math":{"@attributes":{"overflow":"scroll"},"mrow":{"mrow":{"mrow":{"mi":"\u03b4","mo":["\u2062","\u2062"],"mstyle":{"mspace":{"@attributes":{"width":"0.3em","height":"0.3ex"}}},"msub":{"mi":["f","min"]}},"mo":"=","msqrt":{"mfrac":{"mrow":[{"mn":"2","mo":"\u2062","msub":{"mi":"f","mn":"0"}},{"mi":["Q","T"],"mo":["\u2062","\u2062"],"mstyle":{"mspace":{"@attributes":{"width":"0.3em","height":"0.3ex"}}}}]}}},"mo":","}}},"br":{},"ul":{"@attributes":{"id":"ul0003","list-style":"none"},"li":{"@attributes":{"id":"ul0003-0001","num":"0000"},"ul":{"@attributes":{"id":"ul0004","list-style":"none"},"li":["fis the initial frequency of the continuous waveform signal, and","Q is the number of cells in a cycle time, T."]}}}},"Demodulating can include mixing the echo signal with the continuous waveform signal using dual extended duration interlaced demodulation signals or dual frequency band demodulation signals.

However, current CTFM sonars cannot measure either speed or range unambiguously when speed is significant. However, for CTFM signals the time dependent change in the difference between transmitted and received frequencies depend only on range rate and this dependency can be exploited to determine range rate and then that determination can be used to determine range unambiguously. The systems and methods described herein measure the time dependent component of the difference frequency by using a family of demodulating signals parameterized by range rate covering the expected span of vehicle range rates and either searching for maximum output among this family of filters or searching among the filter set for the filter that eliminates the time dependency of the frequency difference. The demodulator signal parameter, and thus the assumed range rate, that maximizes filter output or produces a time independent solution can be used to determine an unambiguous range rate and related Doppler shift. The Doppler shift can be subtracted from the difference frequency and the resultant can be used to obtain an unambiguous range estimate.","A CTFM sonar\/radar using a set of speed dependent demodulating signals for tracking high speed vehicles can require somewhat more bandwidth (for range resolution) and processing channels (for range rate resolution) than a comparable PE sonar\/radar. Additionally, design considerations for a CTFM sonar\/radar system include not overloading the receiver by the transmitted signal. However, such considerations can be outweighed by the benefits provided by a CTFM sonar\/radar system, including lower peak power requirements, a smaller transmit section, and faster update rates. To provide a better understanding of the CTFM sonar\/radar systems and methods described herein, some basic principles of such systems will be described further below. For ease of explanation, the systems and methods can be described herein in relation to sonar systems. However, it can be understood that the systems and methods described herein can be applicable to other systems that can utilize CTFM signals to localize target vehicles or other objects of interest.","Continuous transmission (CT) sonar typically can include a cyclical, linear, frequency modulated (FM) transmit waveform with a 100% duty cycle. Receivers used in CT sonar systems can include a dynamic demodulator and a bank of narrowband filters and narrowband energy detectors. The dynamic demodulator can be such that the transmit signal dynamically demodulates the received signal to baseband. Thus, as is known, the demodulated echo from a target at a constant range is a constant frequency, or tone, with the frequency proportional to range.

For this case, the baseband frequency can equal \u0394f, as shown above. The initial time in each cycle that frequency is not proportional to range is referred to in the art as \u201cdead time.\u201d Older CT systems dealt with dead time by using cycle durations that were much longer than the two-way propagation time to the maximum range of operation so that dead time is a relatively small fraction of the total cycle time with penalties of more required bandwidth and\/or reduced range resolution.","However, recently developed and documented contemporary methods can eliminate dead time at the expense of receiver complexity with no other performance or projector requirement penalties. Such methods can include: (1) demodulation to baseband with dual extended duration interlaced demodulation reference signals ,  (), as shown at  in ; (2) demodulation to baseband with dual frequency band demodulation reference signals , (), as shown at  in ; and (3) demodulation to intermediate band with dual frequency band demodulation reference signals , (), as shown at  in . The preferred methods among these options may depend on total system engineering tradeoffs.","In methods (1) and (2), a low pass filter rejects frequencies above frequency B and the steady tone is proportional to the range in sum of the two demodulation channels (no dead time). For method (2), the first demodulation reference is the transmit Linear Frequency Modulated (LFM) signal and the second demodulation reference is shifted up in frequency by B with regard to the first demodulation reference. For both methods (1) and (2), confusing signals can still remain within baseband sweep band and bandwidth B, respectively. In method (3), frequencies above and below the pass band are rejected. After demodulation to the intermediate band, as shown in , a second demodulation brings the echo tonal in the pass band down to the base band.","For the exemplary stationary target, a number of relationships can be developed.

It can be understood that frequency resolution can be driven by target velocity (Doppler) estimation considerations. In addition, one can choose smaller range resolution and hence greater total bandwidth to reduce reverberation. The range resolution can be sufficiently small such that the target strength of the scattering volume or surface is small compared to the target strength of the target of interest. Also, the range resolution can be chosen so as not to over resolve the target or highlights or scattering centers on the target of interest. Further, in determining the initial frequency, effectively the carrier frequency for B<<f, additional considerations beyond those known for pulsed sonar can be contemplated. These can include selecting flarge enough such that a sound projector with practical fraction bandwidth can provide the desired absolute bandwidth, B, and that demodulation down to intermediate frequency is possible.","The above formulations can be extended to a moving target.
