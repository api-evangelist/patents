{"@attributes":{"id":"description"},"RELAPP":[{},{}],"p":["This application claims the benefit of U.S. Provisional Application No. 60\/403,259 filed Aug. 13, 2002, the entire disclosure of which is incorporated as part of this application.","This application relates to optical communication devices and systems, and more particularly, to integration of fiber arrays, lens arrays, and sensor arrays to optical processing modules such as reconfigurable optical add-drop multiplexers, cross-connect optical switching arrays, wavelength-division multiplexers or demultiplexers, wavelength routers, or free space propagation fabric in optical networks.","Advances in information technologies and their applications such as Internet have increased the demand for communication bandwidth. For example, the transmission of data over a telephone trunk lines, the transmission of images or video over the Internet or other networks, the transfer of large amounts of data as might be required in transaction processing, or videoconferencing implemented over networks such as a public telephone network typically require the high speed transmission of large amounts of data. As applications such as these become more prevalent, the demand for communications bandwidth capacity increases accordingly.","Optical fiber is a transmission medium and is well suited to meet this increasing demand for communication bandwidth. Optical fiber has an inherent bandwidth that is much greater than metal-based conductors, such as twisted pair or coaxial cable; and protocols such as the SONET and Ethernet optical carrier (OC) protocols have been developed for the transmission of data over optical fibers.","Optical fiber has been widely used to form optical networks that carry data, voice and video over optical fibers using multiple wavelengths of light in parallel. Light is routed through the network from its originating location to its final destination. Since optical networks do not generally have a single continuous optical fiber path from every source to every destination, the light is switched as it travels through the optical network. Previously, this switching was accomplished using optical-electrical-optical (\u201cOEO\u201d) systems, where the light signal was converted to an electrical signal, switched electrically, and the switched electrical signal was converted back to an optical signal.","However, because in OEO systems the signal must be converted from the optical domain to the electrical domain, switched, then converted back into the optical domain, the OEO systems for such operations in general can be relatively large, complex, and expensive. Moreover, many electrical systems have slower performance than optical systems and they are not transparent to wavelengths and communication protocol. Hence, the use of an OEO system can create a bottleneck in the optical network.","All-optical cross-connect switching systems have been investigated and developed based on a variety of different technological approaches to optical switching, such as movable mirrors, acousto-optic diffraction, electro-optic refraction, magneto-optic switching, movable bubbles, and liquid crystal addressable arrays. Each of these and other optical switching technologies has its own performance characteristics, advantages and disadvantages. One issue associated with optical switching is the variation in the optical intensities of different signals after switching. For example, in the system where an optical cross connect switch resides at nodes in a ring-mesh network, light signals received at the node may be of widely varying intensity. In many optical cross connect switches insertion loss is dependent on the optical path. It is typically desirable to equalize the intensity levels of the different signals before they are amplified or routed to another node.","Thus, there is a need for an optical cross-connect switching system to switch optical signals in the optical domain, without converting the optical signals to electrical signals. In particular, there is a need for an effective mechanism to integrate fiber arrays, lens arrays and position sensing arrays to an optical processing module such as an optical cross-connect switch.","This application includes various implementations of a fiber alignment module for integrating an array of fibers to other optical components or modules and optical systems incorporating such a module. In one implementation, a device includes a fiber alignment module holding fibers in parallel to form a fiber array. The fiber alignment module includes first and second alignment plates, and a spacer plate engaged between the first and the second alignment plates. Each alignment plate includes an array of through holes to respectively hold the fibers. Each hole is configured to include a neck portion that is approximately the same dimension as the fiber to define a position of the fiber and a tapered portion whose dimension is greater than the fiber to assist insertion of the fiber. The spacer plate has an array of through holes in alignment with the arrays of through holes in the first and the second alignment plates to respectively hold the fibers.","In one application, the above fiber alignment module may be implemented in a device which has an optical processing module to process light and to direct light to or receive light from the fiber array held by the fiber alignment module. A lens array is included in this device at a position between the fiber alignment module and the optical processing module and is engaged to an opening in the optical processing module. The lens array has an array of lenses formed on a single substrate to collimate light from the fibers in the fiber array and to focus light to the fiber array.","In another application, the position sensitive detector arrays are included in addition to fiber and lens arrays.","This application also includes methods for fabricating, assembling, and operating various optical devices disclosed herein. In one implementation, a method includes the following operations. Alignment feature grooves are formed on at least one surface of the substrate, where each alignment feature grove is dimensioned to hold an alignment fiber member. An array of through holes are formed in the substrate to hold fibers, where each through hole has a cylindrical neck portion on one side of the substrate to tightly hold a corresponding fiber and a tapered funnel portion on another one side of the substrate with an opening greater than each fiber. The substrate is engaged to a surface of another object with matching alignment features by aligning each alignment feature in the substrate to a corresponding matching alignment feature in the surface with the alignment member positioned there between.","Another device of this application includes a fiber alignment module holding fibers in parallel to form a fiber array. The fiber alignment module includes first and second alignment plates, and a spacer plate engaged between the first and the second alignment plates. Each alignment plate has an array of through holes to respectively hold the fibers, and each through hole is configured to include a neck portion that is approximately the same dimension as the fiber to define a position of the fiber and a tapered funnel portion whose dimension is greater than the fiber to assist insertion of the fiber. The spacer plate is configured to have an array of through holes in alignment with the arrays of through holes in the first and the second alignment plates to respectively hold the fibers.","This application further describes a device to include first and second fiber arrays of fibers respectively held by first and second fiber alignment modules, and first and second lens arrays to collimate light for the first and the second fiber arrays, respectively. Each lens array includes lenses that are monolithically formed on a substrate. This device also has an optical processing module located between the first and the second lens arrays to provide optical communication between the first and the second fiber arrays and two position-sensitive detector arrays. The first position-sensitive detector array has detectors respectively corresponding to fibers in the second fiber array and each detector is configured to measure a position of a beam relative to a corresponding fiber. The second position-sensitive detector array has detectors respectively corresponding to fibers in said first fiber array and each detector is configured to measure a position of a beam relative to a corresponding fiber as well. A control unit is further included to control the optical processing module to reduce a position deviation measured at each detector in the first and the second position-sensitive detector arrays.","In this device, each fiber alignment module includes first and second alignment plates and a spacer plate engaged between the first and the second alignment plates. In each fiber alignment module, there is an array of through holes to respectively hold fibers. Each through holed is configured to include a cylindrical neck portion that is approximately the same dimension as each fiber to define a position of the fiber and a tapered funnel portion whose dimension is greater than the fiber to assist insertion of the fiber.","These and other features, implementations, applications, and associated fabrication techniques are described in detail in the following description, the drawings, and the claims.","Exemplary implementations of this application include optical switches that optically couple light from a first array of fibers to a second array of fibers. In general, such a switch is designed in a way that a light beam from any incoming fiber can be switched to any outgoing fiber with minimum light intensity loss and minimum cross talk.  illustrate various aspects of the techniques and devices.","An optical cross connect switch system can be designed to switch an optical signal carried by a light beam from any incoming fiber to any outgoing fiber. For purposes of clarity and ease of illustration, some of the figures and description portray the data as traveling one way from incoming fibers to outgoing fibers. However, it should be understood that data travel can also be bidirectional where data travels both ways through the switch, with each fiber acting as both an incoming fiber and as an outgoing fiber, although not at the same time. To accomplish this, the system may have a symmetrical functionality, where some elements of the switching system on only one side (incoming or outgoing side) are illustrated and described in this application while duplicate counterparts of such elements on the other side may not be shown or described.","Assuming there are N incoming fiber lines and M outgoing fiber lines, the optical cross connect switch is referred to as an N\u00d7M switch. For some short haul applications, N and M may be less than 32. For long haul applications, N and M are generally large, e.g., in the range from 1024 to 4096 in certain applications. For wavelength management, N and M may be between 40 and 160 at present time.",{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0042","num":"0041"},"figref":"FIG. 1","b":["100","100"]},"1. Arrays of fibers  and  with their respective alignment structures  and  for holding and aligning fibers;","2. Lens arrays  and , which may be formed by either refractive optical elements including gadded index lens arrays or diffractive optical elements and are used to collimate the outgoing light beams and increase the coupling efficiency of incoming light beams, where the lens arrays  and  typically collimate light exiting from the fibers and focus light entering the fibers;","3. Position sensitive detector arrays  and  for sensing the position of the light beams entering into fibers;","4. A mirror array  to direct the light beam from any incoming fiber to any outgoing fiber;","5. Servo electronics  to control deflection of mirrors in the mirror array  so that the mirror array  may operate to, e.g., direct light beams to selected destinations, align light beams onto the outgoing fibers, and maintain optimum positioning of the light beams;","6. A switch configuration controller  comprising a single channel demultiplexer , a photodetector and amplifier  and a decoder  to determine the destination for the light from each fiber, and configured to dynamically control the cross connect switch  configuration;","7. Fiber splitters coupled to photodetectors to monitor intensities of light coupled into each fiber (illustrated in other figures and not specifically shown in FIG. ); and","8. A system controller , in this case comprising a digital signal processor , application programming interface , and the mirror servo electronics  to control the mirror array .","The following description addresses the switching of a light beam from one of the fibers  in array  to fibers in array . However, the description is equally applicable to switching a light beam between any fiber in array  to any fiber in array , or from any fiber in array  to any fiber in array .","As illustrated in , a beam of light  is carried on a given individual incoming fiber  in the incoming fiber array . The beam of light  may include multiple parallel streams of optical data signals at multiple wavelengths. The beam of light  is also capable of containing streams of optical destination signals carrying information identifying the destination for each optical data signal within the beam.","In this example, the optical destination signal includes instructions on routing of data signals and configuration of the whole switching array. The optical destination signal is carried on one data channel in one selected incoming fiber . The light beam on the selected incoming fiber  is split by using an optical splitter, such as a fiber coupler, into two parts with one main part continuing in the fiber  into the switch and another part to the switch configuration controller . The part to the switch configuration controller  may be a small fraction of the input signal and is converted into the electrical signals by the controller . The controller  interprets the instructions on the routing of data. Within the switch configuration controller , the single channel wavelength division demultiplexer  selects the channel containing the instructions and directs the selected channel to the photodetector with amplifier  which converts the optical signals into electrical signals. These electrical signals, in turn, are decoded by the decoder . The decoded signal provides information for the proper configuration of the switch system . The system controller  uses this information to configure the mirrors in the mirror array  to perform the desired switching.","In one implementation, the single channel demultiplexer  may be a Fiber Bragg grating. Other demultiplexers can be used in other implementations. The switching system  may be part of one node in a larger network with, e.g., a mesh or mesh-ring type architecture. In this case, wavelength division demultiplexer  is generally needed only on one side such as in the incoming side but for redundancy reasons can be included on the \u201coutgoing\u201d side also. Decoded signals from the decoder  within the controller  are fed into digital signal processor  within the switch configuration controller  that provides instructions to servo electronics . The servo electronics  then position the mirrors in the mirror array  to correctly route the data signals. In alternate implementations, the instructions for routing data may be obtained in other manners, for example by providing configuration instructions electrically, using electrical communication between nodes of the cross connect switching system. Also, in some implementations, the system controller  may include an application programming interface  for controlling and monitoring performance of the whole cross connect switching system.","In general, the beam of light  exits the fiber  in a diverging manner. To mitigate effects of this divergence, a lens  in the first lens array  is positioned and used to collimate the beam of light  so that the beam propagates to the mirror array  without significant divergence to a first mirror  in the mirror array . The first mirror  has been positioned by the mirror servo electronics  to direct the beam of light along a first optical path  to a second lens  in the second lens array . The second lens  focuses and couples most of the light  into the outgoing fiber  in the outgoing fiber array . This way, the optical loss is minimized as the light passes through the switching system  and insertion losses can also be minimized.","Position sensitive detector  within the position sensitive detector array  are designed to detect the position of the light beam entering the outgoing fiber  in the outgoing fiber array . Implementations of position sensitive detectors include but are not limited to bilateral photodetectors, quadrant photodetectors, charge coupled device imaging arrays, complementary metal oxide semiconductor device imaging arrays, or infrared imaging arrays. The position sensitive detectors may be placed in several alternative locations in alternative implementations to act as the position sensitive detector arrays  and  and generate position error feedback signals for the system controller  that controls mirror positioning.","In operation, the position sensitive detector  provides signals that indicate the position of the light beam  with respect to the core of the outgoing fiber . Similar position sensitive detectors are implemented at other fibers in the fiber array . In some implementations, the position detectors detect the light beams that carry the optical data signals. In other implementations, the position detectors detect registration light beams that have a different wavelength than the light beams that carry the optical data signals, but which propagate along the identical optical path as the light beams that carry the optical data signals. The position detectors generate a feedback signal that drives the servo electronics  in the system controller  for each set of two mirrors within the mirror array . In response to this feedback signal, the servo electronics  provides the initial alignment after switching and maintains this alignment continuously and dynamically until the instructions for reconfiguration are received through demultiplexer-receiver system.","More specifically in one implementation, the light beam  is positioned over the core of the outgoing optical fiber  for the maximum light to enter the outgoing optical fiber. Deviation of the light beam  from the optimized position over the core of fiber  causes a deviation in the feedback signal that is generated by the position sensitive detector array  and fed into the switch configuration controller . The mirror servo electronics  within the system controller  receives the feedback signal and in response controls the deflection of the mirror  to align the light beam  into the outgoing fiber .  shows the position sensitive array  as being directly in front of the outgoing fiber array . However, in other implementations, the position sensitive array  is placed in alternate locations in the optical cross connect switching system .","In this implementation, the digital signal processor  within the system controller  generates a new destination signal or other signal to provide information on the status of the optical cross connect switching system . This signal allows proper switching at other switches or a network manager on the network. The digital signal processor  sends this signal to the transmitter , which converts the signal to an optical signal. The transmitter  then couples the optical destination signal to the one selected outgoing fiber in the outgoing fiber array  via a multiplexer .","When light beam  is to be switched into a second outgoing fiber , the switch configuration controller  receives a destination signal identifying the new destination outgoing fiber . The switch configuration controller  sends the new destination to the system controller , which repositions the mirror  in the mirror array  so that beam  follows the optical path  to the lens  in the second lens array . The lens  focuses and couples most of the light  into the outgoing fiber  in the outgoing fiber array , using feedback from the position sensitive array  as described above.","In a similar manner, the light beam  can be directed to any outgoing fiber in the outgoing fiber array . The switch configuration controller  determines the destination for light carried by all the incoming fibers. The system controller  controls the deflection of the mirrors in the mirror array  to direct the light to the destination outgoing fiber. The position sensitive detectors in the position sensitive array  provide feedback to optimally position the light beam over the core of the outgoing fiber.","In bidirectional implementations, light beams also travel from the outgoing fibers in the outgoing fiber array  to incoming fibers in the incoming fiber array . This is done in the same way as light beams traveling from incoming fibers in the incoming fiber array  to outgoing fibers in the outgoing fiber array . The switch configuration controller  receives the optical destination signal from the fibers , the system controller  positions the mirrors in the mirror array  to direct the light beams to the appropriate fibers , and the position sensitive array  provides feedback to optimally position the light beam over the core of the fibers .","The fiber arrays  and , alignment structures  and , position sensitive detector arrays  and , lens arrays  and , and mirror array  are shown as one-dimensional in the implementation of  for clarity. In preferred implementations, the arrays may be two-dimensional. For example, in an implementation with a two-dimensional mirror array , there are rows and columns, or some other twodimensional arrangement of mirrors. The other arrays and alignment structures are similarly two-dimensional in some implementations. In addition, the overall system is shown as two-dimensional in FIG. . In preferred implementations, the system can have a three-dimensional structure, as the additional dimension in and out of the plane of the paper can be advantageously used to position the various components.","The feedback from the position sensitive arrays  can also be used to intentionally and controllably misalign a light beam with respect to the core of its outgoing fiber. This controlled misalignment can be used to introduce variable optical attenuation in the switching system to control the output power levels of the signals. The attenuation can be set to different levels, using the feedback to maintain the attenuation at the desired level. If the mirror array  is used simply to vary this attenuation but not to switch between fibers, then the result is a variable optical attenuator (VOA). If both the switching and variable attenuation capabilities are utilized, the result is an optical switch with equalization.",{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0065","num":"0064"},"figref":["FIG. 2","FIG. 3","FIG. 2"],"b":["200","206","208","202","204","300","3","300","226","228"]},"For simplicity,  depicts only one incoming fiber , one outgoing fiber , the fibers' associated lenses  and  and position sensitive detectors  and , one mirror  in the first mirror array, and one mirror  in the second mirror array.

The registration light source  at wavelength \u03bbr may be guided by the fiber  which is coupled to the incoming fiber  through a fiber coupler. Thus, within the switching, the registration light travels the same path as the wavelengths carrying the data signals. Consequently, the position sensitive detector  can detect the position of either the data signals or the registration light signal at wavelength \u03bbr. When data beams are used for position sensing, the position sensitive detector  has high sensitivity at infrared communication wavelengths. Registration light beam with wavelength \u03bbr may operate in the infrared range or in the visible range as long as its wavelength \u03bbr is different from the data wavelengths. In this case, detectors  are selected with high sensitivity at the registration light wavelength \u03bbr.","The optical cross connect switching system in  is bi-directional. At one time period, the data traffic flows from fiber  to the fiber . At another time period, traffic flows in the opposite direction, i.e. from fiber  to fiber . Consequently, additional devices are included in the system. The position sensitive detector  and amplifier  are additional devices included in the system to allow bi-directional data flow. The position sensitive detector  and amplifier  play the same role for traffic from fiber  into fiber  as components  and  do for traffic from fiber  into fiber . Similarly, registration light source  and fiber  are additional devices included in the system to allow bi-directional data flow. The function of registration light source  and its fiber  is the same as light source  and fiber  except that registration light source  and its fiber  are active when traffic travels from fiber  to fiber .

When light  from fiber  is to be switched to fiber , mirror  is deflected so that the light beam  follows path  and travels to mirror  in mirror array  and then, after appropriate deflection from mirror  it travels along path  to lens  in lens array  and fiber . With the two mirror arrangement, central rays of the light beam  are directed to follow optical paths, such as paths  and , from any incoming fiber to any outgoing fiber that are parallel with the axes of outgoing fibers  to . This allows the beam  to couple into the outgoing fiber with minimum insertion losses. If the light beam  drifts from the optimized position on cores of the outgoing fibers, position sensitive detectors in the position sensitive detector array  provide a position error signal to servo electronics that corrects position of mirrors in mirror arrays  and .","Various components in the above systems are now described in more detail as follows.","Mirror arrays can be either one- or two-dimensional, depending on whether the fiber array is one- or two-dimensional. Typically, smaller fiber arrays are one-dimensional, and large systems are two-dimensional.","FIGS. () through () show one implementation of a mirror from the mirror array based on the Micro Electro Mechanical System (MEMS) configuration. Each mirror may tilt in two directions in order to switch the light between outgoing fibers and to make two-directional rotational corrections of the position of a light beam with respect to a core of optical fiber. A set of two hinges may be used in each mirror to define one direction of tilting. In FIG. (), the first set of hinges  allows rotation around the first axis and the second set of hinges  permits rotation around a second axis that is perpendicular to the first axis. The mirrors preferably use two-directional actuators, i.e., actuators which permit the mirror to tilt in both the positive and negative direction with respect to an axis, in order to accomplish the full two-directional rotation correction. In alternate implementations, one-directional actuators are used instead of two-directional actuators. One-directional actuators provide a mirror that tilts on only a single axis in a positive or a negative direction. In these alternative implementations, four one-directional mirror arrays are used rather than the two two-directional mirror arrays shown in FIG. .","Several different technologies for driving and fabricating the mirror arrays and controlling the deflections of the mirrors in the arrays are employed in different implementations. Exemplary riving technologies include electrostatic, electromagnetic, piezoelectric, thermally activated mirrors, and other types of driving technologies. One implementation is based on two-directional, macroscopic electromagnetic galvanometer actuators fabricated with discrete mirrors, coils and magnets such as those used in optical recording drives. Two independent electric currents pass through two separate current loops, and two sets of magnetic fields are applied so that the current, magnetic field and resulting torque vectors are all perpendicular to each other. Electromagnetic galvanometer mirrors fabricated with multiple electrical turns around the mirror and the inner frame and two sets of magnets represent one implementation of two-dimensional rotating actuator. Use of Micro Electro Mechanical Systems (MEMS) in the mirrors can provide improved performance and low cost.","More specifically, FIGS. () through () show one implementation of a controllable MEMS mirror system , controlled by electrostatic driving technology. FIG. () shows a top view, FIG. () shows a side view, and FIG. () shows a bottom view. The MEMS mirror system  includes a mirror . In the implementation illustrated in FIGS. ()-(), the mirror has a circular shape. In other implementations, the mirror  may have other shapes such as rectangle, square, or other suitable geometrical shapes. In FIG. (), the MEMS mirror system  has two sets of hinges  and  that are placed perpendicularly to each other so that each hinge pair allows angular deflection around their respective axes. The outer set of hinges  allows one directional rotation of the inner frame  with respect to the outer frame . The inner set of hinges  allows one directional rotation of the mirror  with respect to the inner frame around axis that is perpendicular to the outer rotation axis.","The length, width, thickness and cross sectional shape of hinges determine the stiffness and consequently the voltages required to achieve desired deflections. The tortional hinge stiffness is proportional to the hinge width and the third power of hinge thickness and inversely proportional to hinge length.","The hinge thickness is optimized so that the stiffness is minimized but the structure is not too fragile so that it would not survive separation after fabrication, handling during assembly and shock and vibration in typical environment. In some implementations, the hinges are single, double, triple or quadruple serpentine hinges. This provides the advantage of allowing relatively narrow hinge width and long hinge length to minimize stiffness.","The reflecting surface of the mirror  is covered with materials that have very high reflectivity in the operating wavelength range of the switch. For optical communications, the operating range may be from about 900 nm to about 1600 nm. Most metal films have higher than 95% reflectivity in this range, and with two reflections, about 90% of the signal can be preserved. In one implementation, a gold film may be used because it has a reflectivity greater than 90% at optical communication wavelengths and long-term stability due to its resistance to corrosion and other degradation.","The mirror  and inner frame  may be made of electrically conducting material (e.g. doped silicon) or of nonconducting material (e.g. undoped silicon) that is coated with electrically conducting film on the bottom side (light  is reflected from the top side of mirror ). This bottom conductive side is connected to a common electrode  that is typically kept at the electrical ground. Film material and thickness on the top and bottom of the mirror and inner frame are typically substantially the same in order to avoid distorting the mirror by differential stress. Metals such as Cr, Ta, Ti, and other suitable metals may be used below the optically reflecting film to improve adhesion of metals such as Au to the mirror surfaces. The driving electrode structure is defined below the mirror with an air gap  that is adjusted according to mirror dimensions, desired deflection angles, torque constants of hinges and voltages planned for full deflections (typically equal to 30% of the air gap between two plates of parallel capacitor to avoid snapping instability of the mirrors).","FIG. () shows that driving electrodes are divided into four segments , ,  and , with two segments controlling deflections in each of the two directions. The segments are in pairs, the first pair being segments  and , and the second pair being  and . The - pair is used to tilt the mirror  about the hinge . Applying a voltage to one segment , while keeping the other segment  and top electrode  at the ground, tilts the mirror  so that the gap between electrode  and mirror  is decreased. Applying a voltage to the other segment , while keeping segment  and top electrode  at ground, tilts the mirror  in such a way that the gap between electrode  and moving mirror is decreased. Inner frame  is tilted in the same manner, using segments  and .","Four fixed electrodes , ,  and  together with movable mirror  and movable inner frame  form four parallel plate capacitors. Hence, mirror  and inner frame  are part of the common movable electrode that is typically held at ground. Based on the position of the light with respect to the outgoing fiber, a voltage difference Vijl is applied to electrode  to obtain a deflection aiji of the mirror around a first axis. A voltage difference Vij is applied to the electrode  in order to obtain a deflection aij of the mirror around a second axis. The indices i and j represent the row and the column of the mirror in the mirror array, respectively. In implementations with two mirror arrays, such as shown in , another pair of voltages, Vkl and Vkl, are applied to two electrodes of a second mirror actuator in the second mirror array. The pair of voltages Vkl and Vkl provide deflections bkl and bkl in the second mirror. In one implementation, typically aij is substantially equal to bkll and aij is substantially equal to bkl.","In some implementations, the actuators are two-directional electrostatic rotational comb actuators. One such rotational comb actuator is described below with respect to and . In electrostatic rotational comb actuators, rotational motion is generated by attractive forces between oppositely charged combs of an edge capacitor. Two sets of hinges are employed to provide rotational motion in two directions. Up to six leads connect electrical voltage sources with combs. For large arrays, leads are routed along the walls of the top wafer onto the lower wafer that contains driving electronics. Rotational comb designs have leads incorporated on fixed comb electrodes and the ground potential is applied to movable comb electrodes. The leads are brought along the walls toward the bottom wafer that contains driving electronics. The interconnections between the top and bottom wafers may be fabricated with flip chip packaging technology using solder reflow or conductive epoxy.","In implementations with large arrays, the electrodes preferably are addressed by a row (or column) of mirrors at the same time and then held at the addressing voltages on these electrodes until the same line is re-addressed again. This approach requires matrix addressing with at least one transistor and one storage capacitor for each pair of top and bottom electrodes (e.g., see the discussion with respect to  below). The capacitor plates , ,  and  can be connected to electrical driving circuitry  with vias .","In one implementation, bulk and surface micromachining methods are used to build these structures. The material for the is mirror and hinges is a single crystal silicon with very low concentration of impurities and defects, which provides a long lifetime for the hinges. Alternative materials are polysilicon, metals or metal alloys such as berylium-copper. In some implementations, the mirror and hinges are fabricated with different thickness, which provides the advantage of avoiding excessive wavefront distortions of light reflected from the mirror.","In one implementation, the fabrication process for structures with different hinge and mirror thicknesses is based on bulk micromachining of double layer silicon-on-insulator (SOI) wafers. The double layer structure is produced by oxidation of silicon wafers, their lamination (internal silicon dioxide layer will be referred to as the first silicon dioxide layer), grinding to reduce the thickness of the silicon layer to the desired thickness of hinges, deposition of another silicon oxide layer (the second silicon dioxide layer), lamination of another silicon wafer and then repeating the process of grinding the wafers to the desired thickness equal to approximately to mirror thickness. Alternatively, epitaxial growth of single crystal silicon is substituted for grinding for one silicon or both silicon layers. The epitaxial option provides good control of thin layers with a good thickness uniformity.","According to one implementation, the fabrication steps is with double layer SOI wafer are as follows:","a. oxidation of both sides of the silicon wafer;","b. photolithography and etching of silicon dioxide of the bottom side of SOI wafer, where separation lines and alignment keys are also etched;","c. photolithography and deep, wet silicon etching of the bottom side of the SOI wafer with the first internal silicon dioxide layer acting as the etch stop;","d. photolithography on the top side of the wafer for open areas in final structure and etching of silicon dioxide;","e. deep, dry reactive ion etching of silicon with the second internal silicon dioxide as an etch stop;","f. photolithography for hinges and open areas and etching of silicon dioxide;","g. deep, dry reactive ion etching of silicon hinges and open areas in the final structure with the second internal silicon dioxide layer as etch stop;","h. etching of silicon dioxide in the exposed areas to open all gaps in silicon;","i. metallization of top and bottom with metallic adhesion layer(s) and high reflectivity material such as gold;","j. driving electronics on the bottom wafer;","k. deposition of insulating layer;","l. photolithography and etching of vias for electrical contacts between electronics and electrodes;","m. photolithography and silicon etching of gap defining grooves and lock part of alignment structures;","n. deposition of metallic layer for electrode fabrication; and","o. photolithography and etching of conductive electrodes on the bottom wafer.","FIGS. () through () show an alternative implementation of a controllable MEMS mirror system  with a torsional post arrangement. FIG. () shows a top view, FIG. () shows a side view, and FIG. () shows a bottom view. In the implementation shown in FIGS. () through (), the mirror system  has one hinge post  that allows mirror deflections in two directions. The mirror includes a reflective surface  formed over movable conductor plate . This torsional post design includes four electrodes , ,  and , but in some implementations, complete two-directional tilting can be achieved using three electrodes. The movable mirror  comprises the second electrode of the parallel plate capacitors formed with the four electrodes , ,  and . The mirror  may be normally held at the ground and is interconnected to the driving electronics through the post  and underlying via.","In operation, driving voltages are applied between electrodes , ,  and  and the movable plate  in a manner similar to that described in FIGS. () through (). When rotational deflection in which the gap on the right hand side of post  is supposed to be reduced, the same voltage is applied to electrodes  and  while electrodes  and  and the movable mirror  are kept at ground. The electrostatic force pulls the right side of the movable mirror  towards electrodes  and  and generates electrostatic torque that bends the post  thus allowing the desired mirror deflection. Other mirror deflections are generated by selecting two electrodes out of four electrodes and applying two different voltages to them, while keeping two remaining fixed electrodes at ground together with the top (movable mirror) electrode.","In alternative implementations, electromagnetic actuators are built to drive the mirror  with one central torsional post. Electrical coils with single or multiple turns are placed on the bottom of the mirror and magnets are located on the sides of mirror assembly. Two or more independent coils and corresponding two or more sets of magnets generate electromagnetic torques in two directions. In yet another implementation, the placement of coils and magnets are reversed with magnets on the mirror and coils on the base.","A fabrication method for these types of torsional post actuators relies on LIGA (Lithography\/Electroplating\/Molding). In one implementation, the following fabrication steps may be performed: photolithography, electroplating or vacuum deposition of the first material, removal of photoresist, deposition of the second material by electroplating or by vacuum deposition, planarization and repetition of the preceding steps for as many layers as needed. The final fabrication step normally involves removal of sacrificial material in order to release the structure.","FIGS. () and () are plots of the intensity of laser light falling on the outgoing fiber, as a function of distance x from the center of the fiber. These plots illustrate the principle of position sensing. The plots in FIGS. () and () are given only for one dimension x. However, the same principle applies in a second dimension y to provide two-directional positioning feedback. As shown in the plot  of FIG. (), the central portion of the light falls onto the core of the fiber  and is coupled into the fiber. The shaded regions  and  indicate light that does not fall onto the core of the fiber . This portion of light is lost for data transmission. However, this light can be used for position detection in the feedback control. When the two light intensities of shaded regions  and  are equal, the outgoing light is positioned optimally on the fiber.","FIG. () is a plot  showing a misaligned light beam. When misalignment occurs, two regions  and  on the fiber receive different amounts of light. Their difference indicates the amount of misalignment and, when sensed by the position sensor, serves as a position error feedback signal to the servo controller for the closed loop positioning of the light beam.","FIGS. () and () illustrate that, this type of position sensing uses only light that would not enter the core of the fiber  and would be lost to data transmission. Thus, this type of position sensing is optically efficient and does not divert light that would have been collected by the outgoing fiber.","As seen in , in some implementations, the position sensors can be placed directly in front of the outgoing fibers. In other implementations, position sensors may be placed in positions that are not directly in front of the outgoing fibers. In these implementations, beamsplitters can be positioned in the optical path to capture and redirect a fraction of the light in the optical path. Implementations with beamsplitters result in the loss of light coupled into the fiber. However, these losses are typically small, e.g., only in a range of about 5% to about 10%.  show two implementations that use beamsplitters and position sensors located away from the fibers.","In the switch () of FIG. (), instead of placing the position sensing detector arrays  and  in front of fibers, data or registration light beams are split with beamsplitters  and  before they enter into lens arrays  and . The beamsplitters  and  are selected so that they allow high transmission (typically above 95%) while reflection is limited to about 5% range. Position sensing detector arrays  and  are high spatial resolution sensitive arrays, such as bilateral or quadrant detector arrays or imaging arrays such as charged coupled devices (CCD) or complementary metal oxide semiconductor (CMOS) arrays. These imaging arrays preferably have high sensitivity at monitoring wavelengths in order to minimize insertion losses from placement of the beamsplitter into the optical paths.","For transmission of data from incoming fibers  into outgoing fibers , only beamsplitter  and position sensitive detector array  are needed. For reverse transmission, beamsplitter  and position sensitive detector array  are used. The data or registration light beams that exit from fibers  propagate from lens array  to mirror arrays  and  in the manner similar to the way described earlier. After light beams are reflected from the mirror array , a small fraction of light is reflected by beamsplitter  towards position detector array . The remaining light is transmitted toward output lens array  and outgoing fibers . In some implementations, the size of the position beams is adjusted to match size and pitch of individual detectors by optional lens arrays  and  placed in front of position sensitive detector arrays  and  respectively.","When a registration light signal in visible or near infrared (e.g., around 980 nm) wavelength \u03bbr is used, silicon based CCD, CMOS, quadrant detectors or bilateral detectors are appropriate choices for position sensitive detectors. When data light at standard optical communication wavelengths (e.g., 1290-1610 nm) or registration light at infrared wavelengths (e.g. 1480 nm) is used for position sensing, these detector arrays are typically based on InGaAs, GaAs, Ge or other infrared photosensitive materials.","In implementations that include a beamsplitter and position sensing detectors outside the normal optical path between incoming and outgoing fibers, as well as implementations where the position sensing detectors are in front of the fibers, positioning calibration of detectors is performed with respect to the center cores of optical fibers. The calibration is done by measuring the light intensity that reaches the outgoing fibers. When the light intensity is at its maximum, the two dimensional light beam positions on position sensitive detectors are recorded. This provides initial reference mirror positions that result in the maximum light intensity coupled into the outgoing fibers.","For implementations where the position sensors are not in front of fibers, the determination of reference positions of mirrors and position sensors may be done at the same time. The reference position of position sensors is recorded when reference position of mirrors is determined with maximized light intensity coupled into outgoing fibers. The pairs of mirrors from mirror arrays  and  are moved in small incremental rotational steps while the light intensity coupled into a selected fiber is continuously monitored. When the maximum light intensity is reached, reference mirror position is recorded in terms of two voltages required to attain the optimum position of the mirror pair. At the same time, two coordinates representing the position of beamsplitted light beam on the position sensitive detector  is recorded.","FIG. () shows another implementation of an optical cross connect switch . The fiber array surface is covered by a highly reflective surface having openings over the core of fibers to reflect light failing outside each fiber core. In one implementation, the pattern of apertures that are positioned over fiber cores is created without photomasking as follows. The completed fiber array with properly terminated fiber ends (this may include plane polishing, angled polishing, laser cutting and polishing and antireflective coatings) is coated with photoresist. All fibers in the array are illuminated from the opposite end with ultraviolet light that provides exposure of photoresist. Subsequently, exposed photoresist is developed and removed from unexposed areas, leaving photoresist covering only the fiber cores. In the next step, a reflective metal film is deposited by sputtering or evaporation over the whole fiber array assembly. In the final step, the photoresist is removed which lifts off the metal covering the fiber cores. This approach provides apertures in the reflective metal coating over the fiber cores without using any photomasking operations. Alternatively, the same general approach may be used except that etching steps are used to substitute the liftoff process.","In the switch () of , light beams are split with beamsplitters  and . However, in this case, the light beams travel from the incoming fibers, are reflected off the two mirror arrays  and , travel to the outgoing fibers and are back reflected from the reflective surface on the outgoing fibers. Light falling onto fiber cores is not reflected. The back reflected light from the outgoing fibers is split by the beamsplitters  or  onto position sensitive arrays  or .","For example, the beam of light  out of the incoming fiber  is collimated by lens , and is then reflected off mirrors  and . Next, the light beam  is focused by lens . The part of the focused light beam  that does not enter the core of the outgoing fiber  is reflected from the reflecting surface that surrounds the core of the outgoing fiber . This reflected light returns to beamsplitter , where it is split and sent to the position sensitive detector array . The position sensitive detector array  detects the position of the light beam  and provides feedback to the system controller .","When bilateral and quadrant position sensitive detectors are used in the position sensitive detector arrays  and  in FIG. (), apparent beam positioning is obtained and corrections are applied to determine actual positions. When imaging arrays are used, an image of the aperture around the fiber core and back reflected light are both recorded in the image. This implementation provides the advantage that both fiber cores and light beams are imaged, so no referencing calibration is needed.",{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0120","num":"0119"},"figref":"FIG. 8","b":["800","800","810","102","104","114","116","302","304","801","102","104","802","810","810","850","860"]},"Compared with the previous architecture, detector  is added in order to simplify servo design and implementation. In order to direct light incident to the detector , the beamsplitter  is placed in the path of beams . When the detector  operates at signal wavelengths, small fraction of signal light(e.g., about 2% to 5%)is split from the main beam in the path . When the registration beam is used, the beamsplitter  can transmit the data beam without any loss of light intensity and reflect registration beam completely.","For bi-directional traffic, two more position sensitive detectors  and  are included in the system. They are functional for beams along the path  going from the fiber array  to the fiber array . The beamsplitter  is used to operate with the similar functionality in the backward direction along the path  as the beamsplitter  in the forward direction along the path . The lens arrays , ,  and  are optionally employed in front of position sensitive detectors , ,  and , respectively.","Hence, two position sensitive detector arrays may be implemented for unidirectional transmission and four position sensitive detector arrays may be implemented for bidirectional transmission.","FIGS. () and () illustrate one implementation of a position sensing detector array  with bilateral sensors. FIG. () represents the top view while FIG. () is the side view of the array. The implementation illustrated in FIGS. () and () can be applied in cases where the position sensing photodetector arrays are not directly in front of the fibers, such as the implementations shown in . In these implementations, there is space behind the position sensing arrays available for electrical leads and integrated circuits that amplify the signals. The position sensing photodetector array  shown in FIGS. () and () is based on rows  of position detectors  that are attached to a chip  that includes integrated circuits that provide amplification of photocurrent and signal multiplexing. Each position sensor  has four electrodes . Electrical leads  connect the electrodes  to integrated circuit amplifiers on chip . The light beam that impinges onto the photosensitive surface leads to generation of photocurrent that flows toward all four electrodes . The relative magnitudes of the four currents through the electrodes  correspond to where the beam is located on the photosensitive surface, and provides the x and y position of the light beam. The photodetector's sensitive area is smaller than the pitch between mirrors or fibers in order to accommodate all electrical leads.","FIGS. (), () and () illustrate another implementation of a position sensitive detector array  suitable for use with the systems shown in , where the position sensitive array is placed directly in front of or even in contact with the fiber array. Fiber array  has cladding regions  and core regions . The position sensitive detectors  are placed on the face of fiber array. The light is coupled into the fibers with lens array .","Detailed front and side views of the single quadrant photodetector  that is used in some implementations where the position sensitive detector array is in front of the fiber array are shown in FIGS. () and (), respectively. The detector  is divided into four quadrants , ,  and . Each quadrant contains a separate detector such as a photosensitive p-n junction or photosensitive pin diode . Each of these detectors , ,  and  covers about a 90 degree region. The detectors do not cover the center of the fiber over an area that corresponds to the core of the fiber . This area contains material that is transparent at the operational wavelength or an opening without any material. Consequently, this implementation is suitable for use with the implementation shown in . The cross section of an implementation of a pin diode  is shown in FIG. (). The electrode  is a common electrode and the four detector regions - provide four separate signals into four single ended or two differential amplifiers.","In some implementations, quadrant photodetectors in  are substituted by bilateral detectors similar to those described above in FIG. . When bilateral sensor arrays are placed in front of fibers, then one sensor with an opening over the core of the fiber is used. The sensor has four electrodes positioned on the outside edges of a photosensitive multilayer structure as in  above. Signals collected from these four electrodes reflect the two directional position of the light beam.","FIGS. () and () illustrate electrical lead interconnects  for large position sensitive detector arrays. The interconnects  shown in FIGS. () and () allow large numbers of leads to be accommodated, even when there is little space available between the sensors. The interconnects  also allow fast readout of the sensors in the array. This is done by performing a matrix readout row by row (or column by column). This allows readout of one complete row at a time. The implementation shown in  is illustrated with an array of quadrant detectors . Front electrode column leads  and row leads  are connected to transistors . The signals applied to the row leads  select one row at the time that is being read out. The signals that appear on columns correspond to positions of light beams in that specific row. During the next readout period, the next row is addressed and read out. All detectors have the same common ground electrode , shown in FIG. (). The configuration of this ground electrode is the same as shown in cross section in FIG. (). For implementations where the common electrode  is metal, the common electrode  has openings for light passing into fibers. In some implementations, where a transparent electrode such as indium-tin oxide film is used, the common electrode  is continuous. Signals from these photodetectors  are fed into amplifiers to generate two sets of feedback signals that are fed into the servo controller. In response to the feedback signals, the switch controller  controls the positioning and alignment of all mirrors in the mirror array to align the light beam onto the core of fibers in two directions and maintains the alignment until instruction is received to change the configuration.","FIGS. () and () illustrate another configuration of position sensitive detector array . In the previous described implementations, the illuminated surface and non-ground electrodes are on the same surface (front side illumination). In the implementation of , illuminated surface  and non-ground electrodes  are on the opposite sides (back side illumination). Light beams  impinge on the substrate  of position sensitive detector array. The substrate  is relatively thin and does not significantly absorb the light. Most of light reaches the p-n junctions of quadrant photodetectors  where photo-generated carriers are formed. The electrodes  provide electrical path for carriers to amplifiers that reside in layer . This quadrant photodetector  generates again two dimensional position sensitive signals. In some implementations, the photodetector array  is placed directly over a substrate  containing amplifiers and processing electronics. This configuration of detectors is well suited for architecture described above, e.g., FIGS. () and ().","FIGS.

In alternate implementations with a neck-funnel-funnelneck arrangement, both an odd number of alignment layers are used. Alignment layers  and  and fiber  are secured together with glass or glue bonds  so that a hermetic seal is formed between the fiber  and alignment layers  and . Glass bonding provides the advantages of having a thermal coefficient match between the fiber glass and bonding glass and an environmentally stable glass seal. Since glass bonding is usually performed at relatively high temperatures, special insulation spacers  may be included in the alignment structures to thermally isolate buffer  from alignment layers  and  during glass bonding.","The multiple constricted channels or necks in the alignment layers  and  define the fiber positions and also the direction of light exiting from the fiber .

In some implementations, a buffer alignment block  with cylindrical holes serves as a positioner and holder of buffer coatings. Alternatively, an approach similar to that used with fiber alignment layers is followed with buffer alignment layers. Openings in the buffer alignment block  are larger than the funnels and bottlenecks in the fiber alignment layers  and  to accommodate the larger buffer diameter. Buffer  and buffer alignment block  are glued together to mechanically stabilize the structure and further seal it for hermetic isolation from outside environment.","The overall structure contains alignment features on each top and bottom surface of each alignment chip. In some implementations, these alignment layers are formed by two-sided photolithography so that alignment down to one micron is possible. V grooves formed in single crystal silicon, as outlined above, present an example of an alignment structure. Fibers having precise diameter and circular cross-sections are inserted into V grooves and they self align bottom surface of one chip and the top surface of another chip. Multiple stack of chips can be aligned this way and achieve chip-to-chip alignment with precision down to about one micron. The structure can include vias that go through the buffer layer and at least one alignment layer. Mechanical pins, of a controlled diameter and concentricity, can be inserted into these vias to align the alignment layer and buffer block.","Lens arrays in this application, including Lens arrays ,  in  or lens arrays  and  in , are one or two dimensional matrices of lenses. Examples of the fabrication processes of microlens arrays are placing spherical ball lenses in one or two dimensional array of precisely micromachined cylindrical or tapered holes and lens matrices fabricated with gray scale lithography, with embossing or ink jet formation of glass or polymer. Both refractive optical elements such as microlens arrays and graded index lens arrays, and diffractive optical elements may be used to form the lens arrays. The material for the lens arrays may be a glass material, a semiconductor material such as silicon, or other suitable materials.","It is contemplated that a fiber array alignment module with necks and funnels can be fabricated with molding techniques. For example, a molding material such as ceramic materials (e.g., alumina) may be used to form the substrate plate. The alignment plate is molded with pins that are placed in the molding material at desired positions. Each pin has one end widened to have the desired neck-funnel profile. After mild sintering at a desired sinter temperature, pins are pulled out and the structure is fully sintered. Shrinkage is taken into account by using pins of somewhat larger diameter than the final desired diameter. The voids left behind in the shaped molding material after removal of pins with cylindrical profile and conical ends are through neck-funnel features that allow insertion and positioning of fibers. Pins can be made of a high melting temperature material such as tungsten, stainless steel, etc. The melting temperature of the pin material should be higher than the molding material for the substrate plate.","FIGS. () and () show an exemplary electrostatically-driven MEMS mirror system with a twodirectional rotational comb actuator. The rotational motion is generated by attractive forces between oppositely charged teeth. The MEMS mirror system has a mirror , an inner frame , an outer frame , sets of inner movable teeth  and , sets of inner fixed teeth  and , sets of outer movable teeth  and , sets of outer fixed teeth  and , two inner hinges  and two outer hinges . The set of inner fixed teeth  are fixed with respect to the movable inner teeth , but not with respect to outer frame . The top actuator portion, shown in FIG.

The mirror , teeth , ,  and , inner frame , outer frame  and hinges  and  are kept at the same potential, typically ground, labeled as . Voltages are applied to bottom teeth , ,  and  in order to generate rotational deflections. The voltages are applied through electrically conducting blocks , ,  and  that are electrically isolated from each other but are connected electrically to teeth , , , and  respectively.","The following description of the operation of the actuator only deals with one rotational deflection of the mirror . However, the other deflections of mirror  and inner frame  are generated in the similar manner. In order to rotate the mirror  around the axis defined by inner hinges  so that the top part of the mirror moves down and consequently the bottom part of the mirror moves up, the voltage is applied to electrode  while all other electrodes ,  and  are kept at ground. The electrostatic attraction between inner movable teeth  and inner fixed teeth  generates rotation around an axis going through two inner hinges . In order to generate rotational motion in two directions, two different voltages are applied. One voltage is applied as described above between top ground plate  and teeth  and another voltage is applied between the ground plane  and outer fixed teeth .","The electrostatic rotational comb actuator has the advantage of generating significantly greater torque than some other actuators. Consequently, higher rotational angles can be obtained with rotational comb drive than with other types of drives, such as parallel plate drive, at the same driving voltages. Alternatively, when the same driving voltages are used, a MEMS mirror system with rotational comb drive can have much higher hinge stiffness than parallel plate drive and still obtain the same rotational angles.","The servo system for the above optical cross connect switches may be designed to operate in the following manner. The electronics continuously scans through the whole system sequentially, typically one row of photodetectors and one row of mirrors at a time, with an overall cycle period Tc. When there are N fibers present, time to detect signals from a single row of photodetectors will be about tu=Tc\/(N). Once the signals from the photodetectors are acquired, the driving voltages to all mirrors in a given column are adjusted and kept at this level until the photodetectors are re-addressed Tc time later. In the following update period tu, the next row of photodetectors is sensed and voltages for the second set of mirror electrodes are re-adjusted. The updating time tu depends on the time necessary to acquire signals with an acceptable signal-to-noise ratio. The overall cycle period Tc depends on the number of mirrors in the array, but is typically kept below a specified period, e.g., 1 msec, even for large arrays. The drifts and environmental changes have a time scale that is much longer than the update time. Shock and vibration disturbances are also minimized through closed loop servo control.","Many optical devices and systems in optical networking applications are configured with free propagation of light carrying various information such as data, video and voice. Examples of such devices and systems include, among others, optical cross-connect switches, wavelength division multiplexers, optical add-drop multiplexers, and wavelength routers. Typically, light may be brought or received from an array of fibers, collimated through a lens array, subsequently propagated through the switching or multiplexing\/de-multiplexing device, and then focused by a lens array to couple back into another array of fibers. In some cases, an additional array of optical sensors may be needed between the fibers and lenses. In bi-directional systems, these sensor arrays have to be placed on both the incoming and outgoing sides of the systems.","Assembly and alignment of fibers, sensors and lenses can be particularly challenging for large arrays that are typically used in long-distance and metro applications where the number of fiber channels exceeds a certain number of channels, e.g., 32 channels. In many of these cases, one dimensional (1D) arrays can be inadequate for accommodating the large capacity and thus a two dimensional (2D) array may be desirable. In 1D arrays, V grooves fabricated on silicon wafers with lithography and wet etching of bulk silicon are used. Precise spacing and directionality of light can be achieved when the lens array and fiber array have identical pitch and are aligned translationally and rotationally. Such techniques may not be applicable to fabrication of 2D arrays built by stacking 1D arrays because thickness tolerances from one array to the next array add in the stacking direction.","Novel approaches to alignment and assembly of 1D and 2D arrays of fibers, lenses, and sensors are disclosed in the following sections. Such approaches can be used to achieve alignment precision limited only by photolithographic tolerances (e.g., about few hundreds of nanometers), variations of diameter and concentricity of fibers (e.g., typically a fraction of one micron for some specialized fibers) and passive alignment features between fiber, lens and sensor arrays (e.g., below one micron).",{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0147","num":"0146"},"figref":"FIG. 16","b":["1600","1601","1602","1610","1610","1611","1612","1601","1602","1610"]},"The fiber arrays  and  are engaged to and are held by fiber alignment modules  and , respectively. Each fiber alignment module may be implemented based on the structure  in , which has two or more alignment layers  and  fabricated with fiber-holding channels with funnels and necks. The structure  accurately defines the lateral positions and angular directions of fibers in the fiber array with respect to one another. After the fibers are adjusted to desired positions along respective fiber-holding channels, the fibers are fixed in the fiber-holding channels. The end facets of the fibers in each fiber array point to one side of the fiber alignment module which faces the corresponding interfacing surface  or .","It is desirable to keep optical axes of all fibers parallel with one another in order to maintain pointing accuracy of all fibers. Moreover, it is desirable for the end facets of the fibers to be substantially perpendicular to the optical axes of the fibers. Such perpendicular end facets may be formed by first placing fibers in a linear array of V grooves in a substrate and holding the fibers in place by mechanical clamping. Next, wire lapping or dicing may be used to cut the fibers to form the desired end facets. Alternatively, laser cutting, e.g., with a short-wavelength laser such as an excimer Flaser, may also be used to cut the fibers. In other cases, cleaving of fibers before assembly into fiber alignment module is adequate. The perpendicular end facet ensures that the optical axis of the fiber is also the optical axis of light after light exits from the fiber so that the lens array can collimate light beams to be parallel to one another.","In general, optical coupling into a fiber needs a collimator lens to achieve a high coupling efficiency. Conversely, the output beam from a fiber that is directed through free space to a receiving element also needs a collimator lens to correct the divergence of the beam exiting the end facet of the fiber to allow for free-space propagation to the receiving element. Therefore, the fiber system  includes two collimator lens arrays, a first lens array  located between the first fiber array  engaged to the fiber alignment module  and the first interfacing opening  of the module , and a second lens array  located between the second fiber array  engaged to the fiber alignment module  and the second interfacing opening  of the module .

Each detector array has an array of position-sensing detectors respectively corresponding to the fibers in a respective fiber array. Both detector arrays  and  are needed for a bi-directional system  where signals can be received either from the fiber array  or . If the system  is a uni-directional system with light propagating from fibers  to fibers , then only one detector array  on the receiving side with the fiber array  is needed and the other detector array  may be omitted. In operation, each position-sensing detector responds to the received optical beam to produce a detector output signal with spatial information of the beam on the detector surface. This detector output signal is fed into a servo control module for the optical processing module  to adjust the optical elements of the module  that affects the direction of the received beam to align the beam to the center of the receiving facet. In the example of a cross-connect switch, reflectors in optical switches in the signal path are adjusted. Hence, the position-sensing detector array allows implementation of an active feedback control of optical alignment of the output beam to ensure consistent performance and reliable operation of the system, such as minimized insertion losses and cross talk. Each detector array may be located in the optical paths of the signals as shown in  or located out of the optical paths of the signals by using a beam splitter to split a small fraction of the signals to the detector array as shown in FIG.

Each lens array may be formed on a planar substrate or plate, e.g., lenses may be etched from a substrate of a glass, silicon, GaP, ZnSe, or other suitable materials. The edges of the lens array may be shaped to conform to or to cover the edges of the corresponding opening  or . The hermetical seal may be formed between the edges of the lens array and the opening. In one implementation, the material for the housing of the module  and the material for the lens arrays  and  may be selected for hermetic sealing. For example, the housing of the module  may be formed of a metallic material such as Kovar for matching the thermal expansion coefficient with a glass material, and the lens arrays  and  may be formed of a glass material so that the glass-to-metal hermetic seal may be formed.","Alternatively, the fibers may be metallized and are hermetically sealed to metallized silicon plates by soldering. The metallized silicon plates are then bonded by soldering to the hermetic housing of the module  to form the hermetic seal.","In some situations, it may be desirable to hermetically seal only module  and in those cases glass windows  and  can be hermetically attached to the walls of the module  while fiber arrays  and  and lens arrays  and  are kept outside of the hermetic box .

One surface A or the two opposite surfaces A and B may be shaped to form the lens array. In the illustrated implementation, the top surface A is shaped to have an array of curved and protruded areas  to form and define individual convex lenses while the opposite surface B is substantially planar. The spacer  may be used to provide a desired spacing between the lens array  and the array of fibers  to ensure the end facet of each fiber  is approximately at or near the focal plane of the corresponding lens in the lens array . The spacer  may be formed between the planar bottom surface B of the lens array  to create a space  between the lens array  and the fiber alignment module . This space  may be used to accommodate the fibers  that extend beyond the fiber alignment module . Since the lensing effect of the lens array  of the illustrated implementation is effectuated by the top surface A, an index-matching dielectric material such as an index-matching liquid may be filled in the space between the fiber alignment module  and the planar bottom surface B to reduce optical reflection at the bottom surface B. The top surface A may be coated with an anti-reflective coating to reduce the reflection. Alternatively, space  is left unfilled and fiber facet surface and two lens surfaces A and B are coated with antireflective films. Also, the surfaces of fibers are normally coated with antireflective layers in order to minimize back reflections and reduce insertion loss.","One technical issue in assembling the structure in  is lateral alignment of fibers  to the optic axes of the corresponding lenses , respectively. In the illustrated implementation, this lateral alignment may be achieved by using pre-formed alignment marks (e.g., ) and grooves (e.g.,  and ). Alignment marks may be formed in the lens array  and the fiber alignment module  as alignment references. The lateral positions of the lens array  and the fiber alignment module  may be adjusted relative to each other to align up the alignment marks. When alignment features such as grooves  and  are present, passive alignment is achieved between fiber array  and lens array .","Passive alignment of fiber and lens arrays can be accomplished by using alignment features lB and  in fiber array plate and the spacer  between lens array assembly  and fiber array assembly , respectively. Alignment features  and  can be in-plane V grooves that are photolithographically defined and etched in the silicon or other substrates with high precision. Fiber array plate , the spacer , and the lens array  can be aligned by inserting bare alignment fibers  into the common grooves formed by aligned alignment features in two opposing surfaces of two different layers. For example, the alignment feature (V groove)  on the bottom surface of the spacer  is aligned with the alignment feature (V groove)  on the top surface of the plate  with the neck-funnel features to form a channel for inserting an alignment fiber  to force the alignment between the spacer  and the plate . Similar alignment features on the lens array  and the spacer  are used along with alignment fibers to facilitate alignment between the lens array  and the spacer . As a result, the lens array  and the fiber array fixed in the plate  are aligned with respect to each other.","In the illustrated implementation, the top surface A of the fiber alignment module  is designed to have triangular cross section grooves or pyramidal holes  (e.g., V grooves or holes formed in silicon substrates with precisely defined angles) which are sized to receive a portion of a cylindrical rod with precise uniform diameter and minimal excentricity (such as optical fiber ) or uniform diameter spheres while exposing another portion of the same rod or sphere above the surface A. The spacer , which is engaged to and is affixed to the lens array  and fiber array , is designed to have grooves  on the top surface that match the grooves  in the lens array  and grooves  on the bottom surface that match the grooves  in the fiber array. Top and bottom alignment grooves  and  are formed in the spacer  using double sided photolithography.","In the alignment process, an alignment rod  can be bonded or mechanically clamped to each alignment groove  on the surface A. The assembly of the lens array  and the spacer  is positioned over the fiber alignment module  to overlap the corresponding matching fiber groove  to the alignment rod . Since a portion of the alignment rod  protrudes above the surface A, the protruded portion of the alignment rod  can be received by the groove  to force the assembly of the lens array  and the spacer  into the preset aligned position. Alignment of grooved spacer  and lens array can be automatically accomplished by bonding silicon spacer  with V grooves to plate . This can simplify the alignment process, reduce the assembly time, and ensure alignment accuracy. Alternatively, precise silicon balls may be used to replace the alignment rods.

This design with two curved surfaces can be used to achieve a long focal length to place the beam waist of a Gaussian beam at the center of the optical path within the optical processing module  shown in FIG.  and the distance between each lens array to the beam waist is within the Rayleigh length so that the divergence of the Gaussian beam does not exceed the optical aperture of each lens. This design can reduce the optical loss. Note that the index-matching liquid may not be filled in the space between the fiber alignment module  and the lens array  because this would nullify the focusing effects of the curved areas on the bottom surface of the lens array but antireflective coating may be used.","The above use of alignment grooves for lateral alignment may be extended to alignment of different substrates is or chips associated with the array of fibers. Referring back to  where a neck-funnel alignment structure is illustrated, different layers with fiber-guiding channels or through holes must be aligned with respect to one another with a high accuracy, especially when the number of layers is large.","Notably, the alignment design in  by using two or more alignment plates with the neck-funnel structures is only one exemplary design.

This is because fabrication of the individual lenses in the lens array usually has inherent inaccuracies in focal length and other variations from one lens to another. Optical collimation essentially requires each fiber end facet to be at or near the focal plane of its collimator lens. Therefore, different fibers may be adjusted to have their end facets at different positions from the lens array. This adjustment may be achieved after the lateral alignment of the lens array with fiber array is completed.","In operation, each fiber is individually adjusted by applying a force to slide its position in the fiber channel of the fiber alignment module. The degree of collimation is optically monitored to determine whether the end facet of each fiber is set to the desired position. Referring back to , different fibers may be set to have different amounts of protrusion out of the fiber alignment module as a result of this adjustment. A high resolution imaging camera may be used to monitor the alignment.","In a 1-Dimensional fiber array, at least two fibers may be adjusted together at a time until all fibers are adjusted to be at their desired focus positions. In a 2-Dimensional fiber array, at least three fibers may be adjusted together at a time until all fibers are adjusted to be at their desired focus positions.","When lens array has lenses with very tightly controlled focal lengths, adjustment of fiber positions along their optical axes is not necessary and fibers can be bonded to fiber alignment structure before fiber array and lens array are aligned and attached together.",{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0173","num":"0172"},"figref":["FIG. 23","FIGS. 16 and 17","FIGS. 19"],"b":["20","22"]},"Referring back to , , and , a position sensitive detector array may be formed on the fiber end facets to measure positions of beams.

Fiber cladding  is aligned and held with precision of few microns by a series of alignment layers ,  and . These layers have guiding and aligning regions. The neck regions define the positions of the fibers, and the funnel regions provide a guide for massive, parallel insertion of many fibers into the structure. Alignment layers - and fiber  may be secured together with glass or glue bonds  so that a hermetic seal is formed between the fibers  and alignment plates  and . Glass bonding may be preferable because of thermal coefficient match between the fiber glass and bonding glass and the environmental stability of glass seal. Even low temperature glass bonding requires relatively high temperatures compared with thermal or ultraviolet curing of epoxies and therefore special insulation spacers  have to be included in the alignment structures to thermally isolate buffer  from alignment layers - during glass bonding. Multiple constricted channels or necks in the alignment layers - define the fiber position and also the direction of light exiting from the fiber .","Properly positioned buffer  provides crude positioning and strain relief for fiber . Buffer alignment block  with tapered cylindrical holes can serve as a positioner and holder of buffer coatings. Alternatively, an approach similar to that used with fiber alignment layers can be used with buffer alignment layers. Openings in the buffer alignment block  are significantly larger than the funnels and bottlenecks in the fiber alignment layers - in order to accommodate the larger buffer diameter. Buffer  and buffer alignment block  are glued together to mechanically stabilize the structure and further seal it for isolation from outside environment. Note, that preferable hermetic seal is at switching core surfaces or are formed by lens surfaces.","The overall structure can include alignment vias that go through all alignment and buffer layers. Mechanical pins, of a controlled diameter and concentricity, can be inserted into these vias to align the multilayer structure of alignment layers and buffer alignment block.","The lens array may be formed by photolithographic and etching processes from a single piece of a substrate.

Alignment features  can be formed by vias with cylindrical neck regions and tapered funneled regions  as described above. The fabrication of these vias can be also as described earlier. Cylindrical rods such as optical fibers that are not part of optical fiber array can be used for alignment. Further alignment can be facilitated when light is input into these dummy optical fibers.","Assembly of fiber-sensor-lens arrays may be implemented in the following steps:","1.
