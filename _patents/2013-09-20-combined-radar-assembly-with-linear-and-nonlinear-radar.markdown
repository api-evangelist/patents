The material contained in the Appendices A through K is incorporated by reference herein as though rewritten fully herein.","In the current state of operations, occasions arise such that threats (or targets) must be detected at a standoff distance. Some threats contain components whose permittivity contrasts substantially with that of the emplacement; such is the case with many threats that are buried. The reception of a subsurface linear radar response from an area whose surface is otherwise undisturbed indicates the presence of a threat. Others threats contain metal contacts and semiconductor junctions whose nonlinear electromagnetic response contrasts with that of the emplacement; such is the case with radio frequency (RF) electronics. The reception of a nonlinear radar response from an area that does not otherwise contain electronics indicates the presence of another class of threat. Often, threats contain dielectric, as well as electronic components, hence they will respond to both linear and nonlinear excitation and either linear or nonlinear radar with detect such as threat. Hence, there exists a need to detect both types of threats, whether or not they are collocated using a single assembly or unit.","A preferred embodiment comprises a combined radar assembly with linear and nonlinear modes. Either mode (linear\/nonlinear) may detect a threat or target. By switching between two radar modes, additional information about the threat is received, and, thus, the probability that it is detected is improved.","A preferred embodiment radar assembly for linear and nonlinear radar transmission and reception comprises at least one signal generator; at least one filter operatively connected to the signal generator; a transmitter operatively connected to the at least one filter for transmitting radar signals, and a receiver operative to receive signals comprising the linear and nonlinear responses from the reflected transmitted signals. The receiver further comprises a first channel for processing the linear response from the received signal; a second channel for the processing the nonlinear response from the received signal; and at least one switch operative to select one of the first or second channels through at least one switch.

Optionally, the signal generated by the at least one signal generator is a single-tone pulse, a modulated chirp pulse having a carrier frequency that begins at a first frequency and increases linearly over a predetermined time interval, or a stepped-frequency chirp pulse.","An alternate preferred embodiment radar assembly for linear and nonlinear radar transmission and reception comprises a signal generator, at least one first filter operatively connected to the signal generator, at least one first amplifier operatively connected to the at least one filter, a transmitter operatively connected to the at least one filter for transmitting radar signals, and a receiver operative to receiving the received signals comprising the linear and nonlinear responses from the reflected transmitted signals. The receiver comprises a first channel for processing the linear response from the received signal, a second channel for the processing the nonlinear response from the received signal, at least one switch operative to select one of the first or second channels through at least one switch, at least one high pass filter operatively connected to the second channel to attenuate the linear response, at least one second amplifier to amplify the nonlinear response; and at least one display operatively connected to both the first and second channels for displaying both the linear and nonlinear responses.","Optionally, the at least one first filter, the at least one first amplifier and the at least one transmitter may operate to process both linear and nonlinear radar signals. The signal generator may generate both linear and nonlinear radar waveforms.

Optionally, the transmitter may comprise a linear radar transmitter portion and a nonlinear radar transmitter portion and the at least one antenna may be alternately connected to the linear and nonlinear radar transmitter portions by the at least one switch. Optionally, the receiver may comprise a linear radar receiver portion and a nonlinear radar receiver portion and the at least one antenna is alternately connected to the linear and nonlinear radar receiver portions by the at least one switch.","A more complete appreciation of the invention will be readily obtained by reference to the following Description of the Preferred Embodiments and the accompanying drawings in which like numerals in different figures represent the same structures or elements.

To achieve an ultra-wide bandwidth for ground penetration as well as imaging resolution, the Army Research Laboratory (ARL) designed the Synchronous Impulse Reconstruction (SIRE) radar as described in F. Koenig, M. Ressler, G. Smith, L. Nguyen, and R. Harris, \u201cSynchronous Impulse Reconstruction (SIRE) radar sensor,\u201d U.S. Army Research Laboratory, Adelphi, Md., Technical Report ARL-TR-4661, November 2008, herein incorporated by reference. The SIRE radar uses a single-cycle impulse waveform, two transmit antennas, 16 receive antennas, and multiple data traces collected while the radar platform is in motion in order to form high-resolution images of surface and shallow-buried targets.  are linear radar waveforms for impulse and stepped frequency, respectively. A single-cycle impulse and its spectrum are illustrated in . An alternative design that allows for more flexibility in the transmitted band is the stepped-frequency waveform illustrated in . Both impulse and stepped-frequency waveforms are broadband. For the impulse, the peak power is high but the average power is low. For the continuous stepped-frequency signal, the peak power and the average power are the same. Either waveform will provide linear detection and ranging.","One advantage of a stepped-frequency design, however, is that its underlying switched-frequency signal source is likely able to dwell on a single frequency for a long period of time. As dwell time increases while transmitting the same average power in a tone or a series of tones, the side lobes caused by interrupting the transmission (e.g. turning the source off or switching to another tone) diminish. This extended dwell time is necessary in order to minimize reflected linear side-lobes from nonlinear reflections, which are usually very weak.","Nonlinear radar can also be implemented in different ways. One popular technique is to transmit a single frequency fand receive the target response at the second harmonic of the transmitted tone, 2f, as described in U.S. patent application Ser. No. 13\/870,519 to Dr. Gregory J. Mazzaro, et al. entitled \u201cMultizone Harmonic Radar and Method of Use,\u201d herein incorporated by reference. A slight variation of this technique tracks a Doppler shift at 2ffor moving targets. See for example, A. Singh and V. Lubecke, \u201cRespiratory monitoring and clutter rejection using a CW Doppler radar with passive RF tags,\u201d , vol. 12, no. 3, pp. 558-565, March 2012, herein incorporated by reference. Other variations chirp (see for example, C. Stagner, A. Conrad, C. Osterwise, D. G. Beetner, and S. Grant, \u201cA practical superheterodyne-receiver detector using stimulated emissions,\u201d ., vol. 60, no. 4, pp. 1461-1468, April 2011) or digitally-modulate (see for example, V. Polacek and R. Pavlik, \u201cThe use of digital modulation signals in radar system for detection of nonlinear scatterers,\u201d in , pp. 743-747, September 2011) the transmit waveform for greater noise rejection. Another common technique is to transmit two tones fand fand receive the intermodulation tones 2f\u2212fand 2f\u2212f(see for example A. F. Martone and E. J. Delp, \u201cCharacterization of RF devices using two-tone probe signals,\u201d in 14, pp. 161-165, August 2007). A technique recently developed at ARL transmits at least two tones and receives not only a harmonic of the transmitted tones (e.g. 2fand 2f) but also the mixing products of those tones near that harmonic (e.g. 3f\u2212f,f+f, 3f\u2212fas described in U.S. patent application Ser. No. 13\/870,519 to Dr. Gregory J. Mazzaro, et al. entitled \u201cMultitone Harmonic Radar and Method of Use,\u201d herein incorporated by reference.  illustrates examples of transmit and receive spectra for a nonlinear radar that transmits one tone and receives harmonics of that tone.  shows examples of spectra for a radar that transmits two tones and receives harmonics as well as mixing products near those harmonics.","A common architecture for transmitting and receiving waveforms for both linear and nonlinear radar is necessary in order to minimize the size, weight, and power of the combined radar system. One preferred embodiment combines a wideband stepped-frequency approach with a narrowband two-tone nonlinear approach is given in .","The signal sources are two stepped-frequency waveform generators A, B. As an alternative, the generators A, B may be pulsed. For linear transmission, a single source B is amplified by amplifier , mixed by mixer , amplified by amplifier , and applied to the transmit antennas at terminal . Mixer  is an upconverting mixer for the transmitter. Its function is to change the frequency of the original baseband (low frequency) signal to an appropriate radio-frequency (high frequency) signal for transmission and excitation of the nonlinear response from a target.","For nonlinear transmission, the outputs of the two sources A, B are combined), filtered by filters ,  and amplified by amplifiers , , and applied via terminal  and switch  to the transmit antennas . Note that the switch  alternates between contact with terminal  (to transmit nonlinear radar) to terminal  (to transmit linear radar).","At the receiving end, for linear reception, the signal is received by receiver antennas  and switch  selects the output of one of the receiver antennas , and passes the signal to the base of switch . Switch  alternates between terminals  and . For linear reception, the signal is amplified by amplifier  and lowpass filtered by low pass filter , and downconverted by mixer , filtered at filter  and inputted to an analog-to-digital converter . Mixers  and  are downconverting mixer. Their function is to change the incoming radio-frequency signal to a baseband signal suitable for digitization (and ultimate decision as to the presence of a target). For nonlinear reception, the signal is highpass filtered by filter , amplified by amplifier , downconverted by mixer , and filtered by bandpass filters ,  (with an amplifier  therebetween). Separate analog-to-digital converter (ADC) units ,  are used for linear and nonlinear signal capture. The ADC in the linear chain will likely be wideband at a lower bit-resolution in order to determine precise ranging for linear responses. The ADC  in the nonlinear chain will likely be narrowband at a higher bit-resolution in order to maintain a high dynamic range in the receiver to detect weak nonlinear responses. A pair of RF switches , \u2014switch  in the transmitter and switch  in the receiver, switched in tandem\u2014adjust the mode-of-operation of the radar between linear and nonlinear. Transmitting from more than one antenna  (e.g. the two depicted in ) increases the overall aperture for illuminating targets-of-interest. Receiving from more than one antenna  (e.g. the four depicted in ) improves signal-to-noise ratio (SNR) and allows for the angle-of-arrival to the target to be determined. Stepping and\/or pulsing the transmit waveform (from A, B) allows the range to the target to be determined.","The preferred embodiment comprises a transceiver comprising a transmit chain that generates waveforms that are appropriate for both linear and nonlinear modes of operation and a switchable receive chain, which captures either linear or nonlinear responses from a radar target. The response to be exploited by the nonlinear receiver may, for example, be the second harmonic of the transmitted waveform.","Target Localization","After the transmit waveform has reflected from the target and been received, an imaging algorithm can be used to process the reflections for localization. A time-reversal-based multiple-signal classification (TR-MUSIC) algorithm is proposed to generate the images using the steady-state harmonic response as described in D. Liao, \u201cA hybrid approach for characterizing linear and nonlinear electromagnetic scattering: Theory and applications,\u201d U.S. Army Research Laboratory, Adelphi, Md., Technical Report ARL-TR-6261, November 2012, herein incorporated by reference.

However, the invention is not limited to the specific components of the bench-top architecture.","In this alternate preferred embodiment (which includes a hardware simulation of the radar environment), the signal generator  is both linear and nonlinear radar waveforms, which may be for example a Tektronix AWG7052. The low pass filters  (which may for example be MiniCircuits NLP-1000+ low-pass filters) are highly linear with a passband below 1 GHz and remove much of the transmitter (Tx)-generated nonlinear (harmonic) distortion. The amplifier , which may for example be a AR4W1000 amplifier, boosts the power of the AWG signal to a level sufficient to excite nonlinear responses from electronic targets. The dual-directional coupler , which may for example be a HP 778D, provides one port for sampling the forward transmit, Tx waveform (which may be monitored for example by a digital oscilloscope ) and another port for sampling the reverse (receive, Rx) signal. The \u201cSimulated Radar Environment\u201d consists of 100 ft of SMA cable  (four 25-ft cables in series), terminated by an SMA-connectorized target A","Two receive chains are selected by a pair of switches A, B, which may for examples be Hittite HMC784MS8GE switches. Each switch A, B may be powered by 5 V from the 6-V\/5-A port on an Agilent E3631A supply and controlled by 5 V\/0 V from the \u00b125-V\/1-A port. In , the \u201cLinear Rx\u201d chain is selected, and the signal is passed directly to the oscilloscope A through an SMA cable . Alternatively, the \u201cNonlinear Rx\u201d chain may be selected. Along the nonlinear receiver path, the signal is filtered by four high-pass filters A-D (which may be for example MiniCircuits VHF-1320+ high-pass filters having passbands above 1.32 GHz), to remove the linear response from capture and processing) and amplified by amplifiers A, B (which may for example be two MiniCircuits PSA-5453+) and amplifier , which may for example be a MiniCircuits PSA-545+. Each amplifier is mounted on an evaluation board and powered by 3 V from another E3631A supply.","RF Signal Generation and Capture","As measured by an Agilent N9923A network analyzer and observed in , the amplifier  (AR4W1000) provides more than a 40-dB gain to the transmit signal. For nonlinear (harmonic) responses, each NLP-1000+ filter () attenuates Tx-generated distortion at frequencies above 1500 MHz by more than 40 dB.  is an illustration showing the signal at the transmitter amplifier  and low-pass filters ","As seen in , illustrating signals relating to the directional coupler and linear\/nonlinear receive chain, the Tx and Rx coupling from the 778D is approximately 20 dB. Also, the nonlinear Rx chain (measured from one HMC784 \u201cRF common\u201d port to the other) passes signals to the 8300A with a gain of approximately 40 dB, whereas the linear Rx chain passes signals through with a loss under 3 dB.","MATLAB Graphical User Interface","The AWG7052 generator , 8300A oscilloscope , and E3631A supplies are controlled via the General Purpose Interface Bus (GPIB).

The transceiver was constructed using an arbitrary waveform generator  as the signal source, a high-speed digitizing oscilloscope A as the signal capture device, and commercial off-the-shelf (COTS) components for the radar front-end (amplification, filtering, and switching). A 100-ft length of SMA cable  terminated in an open circuit simulated a linear radar target; the same cable terminated in an SMA-connectorized FRS radio simulated a nonlinear radar target. A MATLAB GUI was developed in order to control the transceiver remotely. The associated script and helper functions are provided in the appendices. Ranging to the target was demonstrated experimentally using RF pulses, linear FM chirps, and stepped-frequency waveforms.","The preferred embodiment combines linear radar with nonlinear radar. Linear radar detects targets whose permittivity contrasts with that of the background media; detection is best when the physical dimensions of the target are near to or greater than the wavelength of the incident radiation. Nonlinear radar detects targets containing nonlinear junctions, regardless of physical size, whose RF properties convert incident radiation at a set of probe frequencies to reflected radiation at a set of completely different frequencies. The key advantage of the combined linear and nonlinear radar is that it detects both of these target sets. For a given transmitted wavelength \u03bb, the combined radar detects linear targets whose physical size is near to or greater than \u03bbas well as nonlinear targets that can be much smaller than \u03bb.","State-of-the-art linear radars are able to detect mines and bulk explosives, objects in the path of a vehicle, and personnel. The Synchronous Impulse Reconstruction (SIRE) radar constructed at ARL implements a wideband impulse transmit waveform, multiple transmit and receive antennas, and signal processing which creates synthetic aperture images. To date, the SIRE radar has demonstrated standoff detection of metallic and dielectric surface targets whose volume is at least 200 in(see, for example M. Ressler, L. Nguyen, F. Koenig, D. Wong, and G. Smith, \u201cThe Army Research Laboratory (ARL) Synchronous Impulse Reconstruction (SIRE) forward-looking radar,\u201d in , pp. 656105(1-12), April 2007), buried dielectric targets whose volume is at least 1 ft, and people walking inside buildings.","State-of-the-art nonlinear radars detect semiconductor junctions such as those found in RF electronics. The combination of linear wideband and nonlinear narrowband technology enables a single radar to detect a variety of threats: targets that produce a linear response, targets that produce a nonlinear response, and targets that produce both. Some threats contain components whose permittivity contrasts substantially with that of the emplacement; such is the case with many threats that are buried. Reception of a subsurface linear radar response from an area whose surface is otherwise undisturbed indicates the presence of a threat. Others threats contain metal contacts and semiconductor junctions whose nonlinear electromagnetic response contrasts with that of the emplacement; such is the case with RF electronics. Reception of a nonlinear radar response from an area that does not otherwise contain electronics indicates the presence of another class of threat. The combined radar is intended to detect both types of threats, collocated or not.","Often, threats contain dielectric as well as electronic components; hence, they will respond to both linear and nonlinear excitation, as depicted in . Either mode (linear\/nonlinear) of the preferred embodiments shown in  will detect the threat. By switching between the two modes, additional information about the threat is received and thus the probability that it is detected is improved. By combining linear and nonlinear radar capabilities, several additional applications are evident including detection of landmines, weapons, and miscellaneous ordnance, subsurface mapping (of pipes, electrical wires, and other manmade structures), vehicle tracking and navigation (with or without nonlinear tags), through-the-wall personnel tracking (with nonlinear tags), and performing counter-surveillance.","The preferred embodiments of  enable detection of targets whose permittivity contrasts substantially with that of the emplacement; such is the case with many threats that are buried. Another class of threats contains metal contacts and semiconductor junctions whose nonlinear electromagnetic response contrasts with that of the emplacement; such is the case with RF electronics. Linear radar is a detection technique well-suited for targets whose permittivity contrasts with that of the background media, and whose physical dimensions are near to or greater than the wavelength of the incident radiation. Nonlinear radar is another technique, well-suited for detecting targets containing electronics, regardless of physical size, whose RF properties convert incident radiation at a set of probe frequencies to reflected radiation at a different set of frequencies. The preferred embodiments  combine linear and nonlinear radar so as to detect a set of targets greater than either radar can detect alone. The preferred embodiments  enable reception of a subsurface linear radar response or nonlinear from an area whose surface is otherwise undisturbed so as to indicate the presence of a threat. By switching between the linear and nonlinear radar modes, either type of threat is detected. For targets that contain both linear and nonlinear components, switching between the two radar modes provides additional information and the probability of detection is improved.","Obviously, many modifications and variations of the present invention are possible in light of the above teachings.
