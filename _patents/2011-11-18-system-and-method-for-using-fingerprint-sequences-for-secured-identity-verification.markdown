{"@attributes":{"id":"description"},"BRFSUM":[{},{}],"heading":["TECHNICAL FIELD","BACKGROUND","SUMMARY","DETAILED DESCRIPTION OF EXAMPLE EMBODIMENTS"],"p":["The present disclosure relates generally to user identity verification, and more specifically to using fingerprint sequences for secured identity verification.","User identity verification and\/or authentication is widely used in many different types of computing systems in order to control access to sensitive data and\/or other information. Because of the high level of technology available to the public, however, hackers or other unauthorized users pose a greater threat to the security of computer systems. For example, losses due to identity theft in the United States top $30 billion per year.","Fingerprint scanning is one method available for identity verification, and may be used in computer security systems. It is generally accurate alone; however, it is not entirely foolproof as some fingerprint readers have been fooled by counterfeit fingerprint reproductions. For example, fingerprint scanners have been fooled in the past by xerographic copies of an individual's fingerprints or by fingerprints lifted from surfaces such as a desk.","According to one embodiment of the present disclosure, a method includes receiving session information including first fingerprint data corresponding to each of one or more fingers presented by an individual in a sequence on a sensor. The method also includes comparing the session information to stored information associated with the individual. The method further includes determining whether the identity of the individual is verified based on the session information and the sequence.","In particular embodiments, the stored information comprises second fingerprint data and sequence data, and determining whether the identity of the individual is verified based on the session information and the sequence comprises: determining whether the first fingerprint data is substantially similar to the second fingerprint data, and determining whether the sequence matches the sequence data. In further embodiments, the second fingerprint data and the sequence data are pre-determined by the individual.","Particular embodiments of the present disclosure may allow for the session information to further comprise delay data indicating the amount of time between the presentation of each finger. Particular embodiments of the present disclosure may allow for the session information to further comprise duration data indicating the duration of time that each finger remains on the sensor. Particular embodiments of the present disclosure may allow for the session information to further comprise spatial data for each of the one or more fingers presented, the spatial data comprising start point data indicating where contact with the sensor began and end point data indicating where contact with the sensor ended. Particular embodiments of the present disclosure may allow for the session information to further comprise spatial data for each of the one or more fingers presented, the spatial data for each of the one or more fingers presented comprising line path data indicating the path which each respective finger took from where contact with the sensor began to where contact with the sensor ended. Particular embodiments of the present disclosure may allow for the session information to further comprise pressure data corresponding to each of the one or more fingers presented, the pressure data indicating the amount of pressure measured by the sensor. Particular embodiments of the present disclosure may allow for the session information further comprises moisture data corresponding to each of the one or more fingers presented, the moisture data indicating a measure of moisture measured by the sensor.","Technical advantages of particular embodiments of the present disclosure include leveraging the current fingerprint biometric hardware and software technologies, and adding various parameters or criteria to further secure the password and identity verification processes. Other technical advantages include the reduction of false positive identity verifications caused by counterfeit fingerprint reproductions. Other technical advantages include improved protection for critical resources and\/or establishments.","Other technical advantages of the present disclosure will be readily apparent to one skilled in the art from the following figures, descriptions, and claims. Moreover, while specific advantages have been enumerated above, various embodiments may include all, some, or none of the enumerated advantages.","Embodiments of the present disclosure and its advantages are best understood by referring to  of the drawings, like numerals being used for like and corresponding parts of the various drawings.",{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0015","num":"0014"},"figref":"FIG. 1","b":["100","120","110","130","100"]},"According to the present disclosure, however, an individual may present her fingers to fingerprint scanner  in system  in a sequence in order to verify her identity. Such a system may be used, for example, in computer logins or secured building access points. The sequence may be chosen by the individual herself, just as the individual would choose her own password for a computer or website. For example, the individual may choose the following sequence for future identity verification: index, middle, ring, pinky. The sequence may be used in lieu of, or in addition to, a text-based password system. For example, a user may insert text in between certain finger presentations within a sequence. In addition, two or more fingers may be presented at the same time within the sequence. For example, a user may choose the following sequence for identity verification: index, middle, middle\/ring\/pinky (where middle\/ring\/pinky represents the three fingers being presented on the scanner simultaneously). Furthermore, certain requirements may be placed on an individual's sequence. For instance, system  may require that a sequence be longer than a certain number of fingers presented, and\/or may require that a certain amount of different fingers be presented. As another example, system  may require that a sequence contain both text and finger presentation in the sequence.","In particular embodiments, system  may scan each finger as it is presented to fingerprint scanner . In such embodiments, system  may record which finger is presented and at which point in the sequence it is presented. For example, the individual may present her fingers in the following order: index, middle, ring, pinky. In this example, system  may read each fingerprint via fingerprint scanner  and recognize that the index finger was presented first, the middle finger second, the ring finger third, and the pinky finger fourth. It will be appreciated that the same finger may be presented twice in the same sequence, and that the fingers presented may be from either of the individual's hands. In further embodiments, system  may then determine whether the individual's identity is verified based on the fingerprints and the sequence in which the fingers were presented to fingerprint scanner . Such determination may be made by comparison to a stored sequence chosen by a particular individual.","Other criteria may be used for identity verification in addition to the sequence criterion, which may serve to strengthen the identity verification process. For example, the time delay between each finger presentation may be used to verify an individual's identity. Such time delays may vary between each finger being presented. Further, every individual may have a unique style or rhythm of using their fingers for certain tasks. For instance, while typing a certain word, an individual will use her fingers to type the word in the same fashion with a certain delay between each keystroke, which may be on the order of milliseconds. The individual typing that word may have a unique delay between each keystroke as compared to another individual typing the same word. At least one embodiment of the present disclosure may exploit this behavior in order to verify the identity of individuals. In such embodiments, the individual may set a sequence that is as simple as typing a certain sentence. The sentence may then be saved as a sequence of fingerprints with varied delays rather than as a text-based password. Similarly, the duration of time that each finger remains pressed on the fingerprint scanner may be used in order to verify an individual's identity.","In addition, in some embodiments, the shapes, pictures, or symbols one makes on the fingerprint scanner may be used to verify an individual's identity. For example, an individual may set a password comprising certain letters or symbols drawn on the fingerprint scanner. In such embodiments, the fingerprint scanner may be operable to recognize a start point, an end point, and a line path for each finger presented. Similar to the time delay criterion above, an individual's unique start point, end point, and\/or line path may also be exploited for verifying the individual. Furthermore, the fingerprint scanner may be operable to measure the duration of each finger stroke, and may exploit this information for verifying an individual's identity. Other criterion measured by the fingerprint scanner and used in the verification process may include an amount of pressure exerted by each finger presented and\/or an amount of moisture on each finger presented. Any other suitable criteria for verifying an individual's identity may be used, either alone or in conjunction with any of the above. Moreover, in some embodiments, a certain tolerance, margin of error, or delta may be used in conjunction with each criterion in order to avoid false negative identity verifications.","Fingerprint scanner  may refer to any suitable device operable to read and\/or recognize fingerprint patterns. Fingerprint scanner  may include, for example, a surface and\/or sensor operable to capture a digital image of a fingerprint pattern. The captured digital image may be digitally processed to create fingerprint data which is stored and used for matching. The fingerprint data may include a collection of extracted features of the digital image of the fingerprint pattern. In some embodiments, the fingerprint data may include data representing the entire fingerprint pattern of an individual. In other embodiments, fingerprint data may include data representing only partial fingerprint patterns of an individual. For example, fingerprint data may include data representing only the top half or upper left quadrant of a particular fingerprint pattern. Fingerprint scanner  may use sensor technologies including optical, ultrasonic, passive capacitance, active capacitance, or any other suitable sensor technology.","Output device  may refer to any suitable device operable for displaying information to a user. Output device  may include, for example, a video display, a printer, a plotter, or other suitable output device. Input device  may refer to any suitable device operable to input, select, and\/or manipulate various data and information. Input device  may include, for example, a keyboard, mouse, graphics tablet, joystick, light pen, microphone, scanner, or other suitable input device.",{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0022","num":"0021"},"figref":"FIG. 2","b":"120"},"The components of computer  may comprise any suitable physical form, configuration, number, type and\/or layout.

For example, features and functionality discussed with respect to a particular embodiment may be used in connection with features and functionality discussed with respect to another such embodiment, according to operational needs or desires.","Although particular embodiments have been described in detail, it should be understood that various other changes, substitutions, and alterations may be made hereto without departing from the spirit and scope of particular embodiments. For example, although an embodiment has been described with reference to a number of elements included within computer  such as a processor, memory, storage, an interface, and a bus, these elements may be combined, rearranged or positioned in order to accommodate particular switching, routing, or platform needs. In addition, any of these elements may be provided as separate external components to computer  or each other where appropriate. Particular embodiments contemplate great flexibility in the arrangement of these elements as well as their internal components.",{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0041","num":"0040"},"figref":"FIG. 3","b":["310","100"]},"System  may determine the length of the sequence by counting the amount of finger presentations during a fixed amount of time. For example, a \u201ctimeout\u201d of 10 seconds may be used. In this example, a user may have 10 seconds to enter their individual sequence for identity verification. System  may also determine the length of the sequence by counting the amount of finger presentations between a first finger presentation and when the individual has struck a certain key on input device . The first finger presentation may be determined as being the first after a timeout, or the first since the last input from input device . For example, an individual may be required to strike an \u201cEnter\u201d key on input device  in order to finish the sequence much in the same way an individual must strike the \u201cEnter\u201d key in order to submit their password.","In particular embodiments, the sensor may be operable to capture fingerprint data identifying each of the one or more fingers presented. For example, some embodiments may capture a digital image of a fingerprint pattern for each finger presented. The captured digital image may be digitally processed to create fingerprint data which is stored and used for matching. The fingerprint data may include a collection of extracted features of the digital image of the fingerprint pattern. The fingerprint data may represent any portion of the fingerprint pattern presented. The sensor may utilize technologies including optical, ultrasonic, passive capacitance, active capacitance, or any other suitable fingerprint sensing technology.","In particular embodiments, the sensor may be operable to capture delay data comprising the amount of time between the presentation of each finger. The amount of time between presentation may be of any length of time. Capturing the amount of time between the presentation of each finger may act to add another level of security to the identity verification process. For example, when presenting her fingers in a sequence, an individual may instinctively or unconsciously include a certain amount of time delay between each finger being presented. As another example, an individual may present her fingers in such a way that mimics the rhythm of a certain song, drum beat, or piano tune. Doing so will introduce predictable time delays between each finger being presented. Certain embodiments may exploit these time delays in order to add another layer of security to the identity verification process. Similarly, in some embodiments, the sensor may be operable to capture duration data comprising the duration of time that each finger remains on the sensor. Such embodiments may exploit an individual's idiosyncrasies in the duration of time that each finger remains on the sensor much like those that would exploit the time delay between each finger being presented. In addition, the amount of time between each finger presented may be deliberate by the individual. For example, much like Morse code, the individual may choose to have short or long delays between each finger presented in the sequence.","In some embodiments, the sensor may be operable to capture spatial data for each of the one or more fingers presented, the spatial data comprising start point data and end point data. For example, an individual may present her fingers in a sequence, with each finger starting at a start point on the sensor and ending at an end point on the sensor. In such embodiments, the sensor may be operable to recognize and\/or track the start point and end point of each finger. In some embodiments, the sensor may be operable to capture line path data for each of the one or more fingers presented. For example, a user may present her fingers by drawing certain letters or other shapes with each finger being presented. In such embodiments, the sensor may be operable to track the path that each finger takes while on the sensor.","In some embodiments, the sensor may be operable to capture pressure data for each of the one or more fingers presented, the pressure data comprising the amount of pressure placed on the sensor. For example, when presenting her fingers in a sequence, an individual may instinctively or unconsciously present each finger on the sensor with a certain amount of pressure. Certain embodiments may exploit this in order to add another layer of security to the identity verification process. In some embodiments, an average pressure exerted with each finger may be measured. For example, system  may request that the individual enter their fingerprint sequence multiple times in order to determine the average pressure exerted by each finger in the sequence. In other embodiments, the pressure may be deliberately chosen by the individual. For example, the user may choose to apply relatively light pressure for the first, third, and fifth fingers presented, and apply relatively heavy pressure for the second and fourth fingers presented in a five finger sequence.","In some embodiments, the sensor may be operable to capture moisture data for each of the one or more fingers presented, the moisture data comprising a measure of moisture on the fingers. For example, an individual may tend to have a certain amount of moisture (e.g. sweat and\/or oil) on her fingers. Certain embodiments may exploit this in order to add another layer of security to the identity verification process. Similar to the average pressure measurement process described above, system  may determine an average moisture on an individual's fingers and use this information to later verify the identity of the individual. In such embodiments, an imposter may be determined by an increased or decreased amount of moisture on the fingers relative to the average.","In particular embodiments, the session information may comprise first fingerprint data identifying each of the one or more fingers presented. For example, if an individual presented her fingers in the sequence of index, middle, ring, pinky, the first fingerprint data will comprise data for each of the index, middle, ring, and pinky fingers, and the data for each finger will include certain data identifying that finger. In certain embodiments, the data identifying each finger may include a digital image of the fingerprint pattern for the finger. In certain embodiments, the data identifying each finger may include data that is sampled from a digital image of the fingerprint pattern for the finger.","In some embodiments the session information may comprise first sequence data comprising the sequence in which the one or more fingers are presented. For example, if the individual presented her fingers in the following order: index, middle, ring, pinky, the session information may include data indicating that the index finger was presented first, the middle finger second, the ring finger third, and the pinky finger fourth. In further embodiments, the sequence data for each finger may be stored in conjunction with other data for the finger. In some embodiments, this may include storing, for example, the fingerprint data for a finger and the sequence data for the same finger in the same row of a data table. For instance, in the above example where the individual has presented her fingers in the order index, middle, ring, pinky, a first row in a data table may include fingerprint data for the index finger and the number 1 (representing that the index finger was first in the sequence). Likewise, another row in the data table may include fingerprint data for the middle finger and the number 2.","In some embodiments, the session information may include delay data comprising the amount of time between the presentation of each finger. For example, if the individual presented her fingers in the following order: index, middle, ring, pinky, the session information may include data indicating that the delay between the index and middle finger presentations. Likewise, the session information may include data indicating the delay between the middle and ring finger presentations, and\/or the delay between the ring and pinky finger presentations. In further embodiments, the delay data may be stored in conjunction with other data for either finger in the delay sequence. In the above example, this would mean the delay data between the index and middle finger may be stored in conjunction with either the index or middle finger. In certain embodiments, the session information may be stored in a data table format. For instance, referring the above example, a first row in a data table may include fingerprint data for the index finger and delay data for the index-middle presentations.","In some embodiments, the session information may include duration data comprising the duration of time that each finger remains on the sensor. For example, if the individual presented her index finger on the sensor for 10 ms, the session information may include data indicating that amount of time. In further embodiments, the duration data for each finger may be stored in conjunction with other data for the finger. In some embodiments, this may include storing, for example, the fingerprint data for a finger and the duration data for the same finger in the same row of a data table. For instance, in the example where the individual has presented her fingers in the order index, middle, ring, pinky, a first row in a data table may include fingerprint data for the index finger and a number representing the amount of time that the index finger was placed on the sensor.","In some embodiments, the session information may include spatial data for each of the one or more fingers presented, the spatial data comprising start point data and end point data. For example, an individual may present her fingers in a sequence, with each finger starting at a start point on the sensor and ending at an end point on the sensor. The start point data may include data that indicates the location at which a finger was first presented on the sensor. Likewise, the end point data may include data that indicates the location at which a finger was removed from the sensor. In some embodiments, the session information may include spatial data for each of the one or more fingers presented, the spatial data comprising line path data. For example, a user may present her fingers by drawing certain letters or other shapes with each finger being presented. Thus, the line path data may include data that indicates a path that a finger takes on the sensor.","In some embodiments, the session information may include pressure data for each of the one or more fingers presented, the pressure data comprising the amount of pressure placed on the sensor. For example, if the individual presented her index finger with 2 psi, the session information may include data indicating that amount of pressure. Likewise, if the individual presented her middle finger with 1 psi, the session information may include data indicating that amount of pressure. In further embodiments, the pressure data for each finger may be stored in conjunction with other data for the finger. In some embodiments, this may include storing, for example, the fingerprint data for a finger and the pressure data for the same finger in the same row of a data table. For instance, in the example where the individual has presented her fingers in the order index, middle, ring, pinky, a first row in a data table may include fingerprint data for the index finger and a number representing the amount of pressure that the index finger placed on the sensor. In other embodiments, varying levels of pressure within each finger presentation may be recorded. For example, an individual may present her index finger on the scanner for 10 seconds, during which time she places 2 psi of pressure on the scanner for 2 seconds, 3 psi for the next 3 seconds, and 5 psi for the next 5 seconds.","In some embodiments, the session information may include moisture data for each of the one or more fingers presented, the moisture data comprising a measure of moisture on the fingers. For example, the session information may include data indicating the amount of moisture on each finger. In some embodiments, this may include storing, for example, the fingerprint data for a finger and the moisture data for the same finger in the same row of a data table. For instance, in the example where the individual has presented her fingers in the order index, middle, ring, pinky, a first row in a data table may include fingerprint data for the index finger and a number representing the amount of moisture on the index finger.","At step , system  compares the session information to stored information associated with the individual. In particular embodiments, the stored information may include second fingerprint data and sequence data. In some embodiments, comparing the session information to stored information may include comparing digital images in the first fingerprint data to digital images in the second fingerprint data. In certain embodiments, the second fingerprint data and the sequence data may be pre-determined by the individual. For example, in some embodiments, the second fingerprint data may comprise images of the individual's fingerprint patterns. As another example, in some embodiments, the second fingerprint data may comprise data that is sampled from digital images of the fingerprint patterns of the individual.","At step , system  determines whether the identity of the individual is verified based on the session information and the sequence. In particular embodiments, determining whether the identity of the individual is verified based on the session information may include determining whether the first fingerprint data is substantially similar to second fingerprint data in stored information, and determining whether the sequence matches sequence data in the stored information. Determining whether the first fingerprint data is substantially similar to the second fingerprint data may refer to comparing and\/or matching the first data and second data using a certain tolerance, margin of error, or delta. Including a margin of error or tolerance in the determining step may serve to reduce the amount of false negative verifications that may occur due to distortions of a fingerprint pattern when placed on the sensor. For example, a margin of error may be determined from a statistical confidence level analysis. In such example, system  may determine that the individual's identity is verified even without a perfect data match between the first and second data, as long as the first data is within a certain margin of error of the second data.","Although the present disclosure has been described in several embodiments, a myriad of changes, substitutions, and modifications may be suggested to one skilled in the art, and it is intended that the present disclosure encompass such changes, substitutions, and modifications as fall within the scope of the present appended claims."],"brief-description-of-drawings":[{},{}],"description-of-drawings":{"heading":"BRIEF DESCRIPTION OF THE DRAWINGS","p":["For a more complete understanding of the present disclosure and its advantages, reference is now made to the following descriptions, taken in conjunction with the accompanying drawings, in which:",{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0011","num":"0010"},"figref":"FIG. 1"},{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0012","num":"0011"},"figref":"FIG. 2"},{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0013","num":"0012"},"figref":"FIG. 3"}]},"DETDESC":[{},{}]}
