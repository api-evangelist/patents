title: Image signal decoder for determining interframe motion
abstract: On input coded data, variable length decoding is performed, and motion vector information extracted. The motion vector information is transmitted to the threshold value determination section, and a predetermined threshold value and the value of the motion vector information are compared. Based on the number of motion vector information whose values are the threshold value or more, it determines whether it is necessary to control the interframe motion or not. When the control is necessary because the interframe motion is large, the control signal generation section generates a control signal to suspend the decoding by the varibale length decoding section and thereby reducing a frame rate.

Moreover, since LCD monitors provide display by the dot-matrix method, interlace interference occurs when the image signal of the interlace method is displayed. In addition, since LCD monitors are low in screen illuminance, the displayed image is low in contrast and dark.","An object of the present invention is to provide an image signal display system using an LCD monitor, solving the above-mentioned problems inherent in LCD monitors and being capable of providing display of an image quality equal to that provided by TV monitors and CRT monitors, and to provide an image signal decoder for use in the image signal display system.","An image signal decoder according to the present invention is provided with a variable length decoding section for performing variable length decoding on an input image signal coded by a hybrid coding method that uses both intra-frame coding and interframe coding, and generating motion vector information, coefficient information, time information and header information. The image signal decoder is further provided with an interframe motion determination section for storing the motion vector information output from the variable length decoding section, and determining a magnitude of an interframe motion based on a distribution of the motion vector information. When determining that the interframe motion is large, the interframe motion determination section performs control so that the decoding by the variable length decoding section is suspended. The image signal decoder is further provided with: an inverse quantization section for performing inverse quantization on the coefficient information output from the variable length decoding section; and an inverse DCT section for performing inverse DCT on the inversely quantized coefficient information output from the inverse quantization section. The image signal decoder is further provided with: a motion compensation section for performing motion compensation based on the inversely discrete-cosine-transformed coefficient information output from the inverse DCT section and the motion vector information, and generating an output image signal; and a frame buffer for temporarily storing the output image signal output from the motion compensation section.","According to this image signal decoder, the interframe motion determination section detects the interframe motion based on the distribution condition of the motion vector information. When the interframe motion determination section determines that the interframe motion is large, the frame rate is decreased by suspending the processing by the variable length decoding section. Consequently, the formation of afterimages can be suppressed when a played back image is displayed on an LCD monitor.","An image signal decoder according to another aspect of the present invention is provided with a variable length decoding section for performing variable length decoding on an input image signal coded by a hybrid coding method that uses both intra-frame coding and interframe coding, and generating motion vector information, coefficient information, time information and header information. The image signal decoder is further provided with a decode control section for determining a magnitude of an interframe motion based on the motion vector information and the coefficient information output from the variable length decoding section and the number of bits per frame.

When the decode control section determines that the interframe motion is large, the frame rate is decreased by suspending the processing in the variable length decoding section. Consequently, the formation of afterimages can be suppressed when a played back image is displayed on an LCD monitor.","An image signal decoder according to still another aspect of the present invention uses both intra-frame coding and interframe coding. The image signal decoder is provided with a variable length decoding section for performing variable length decoding on an input image signal coded by a hybrid coding method that selectively uses frame processing or field processing for each coding unit, and generating motion vector information, coefficient information, time information and header information. The image signal decoder is further provided with a frame\/field processing detection-section for determining whether the currently performed coding is performed in units of frames or in units of fields based on the motion vector information and the coefficient information output from the variable length decoding section.

The image signal decoder is further provided with: a motion compensation section for performing motion compensation based on the inversely discrete-cosine-transformed coefficient information output from the inverse DCT section and the motion vector information, and generating a first output image signal; a frame buffer for temporarily storing the first output image signal output from the motion compensation section; and a field interpolation section for, when the frame\/field processing detection-section determines that the coding is performed in units of fields, interpolating one of field data of the first output image signal output from the motion compensation section, and generating a second output image signal. The image signal decoder is further provided with an output switching section for performing control so that the first output image signal from the motion compensation section is output when the frame\/field processing detection-section determines that the coding is performed in units of frames, and that the second output image signal from the field interpolation section is output when the frame\/field processing detection-section determines that the coding is performed in units of fields.","According to this image signal decoder, the frame\/field processing detection-section determines whether the coding is performed in units of frames or in units of fields for each coding unit. When it is performed in units of fields, the frame\/field processing detection-section determines that there is an intra-field motion in the area, and the field interpolation section produces a second output image signal by interpolation and outputs it. Consequently, the occurrence of interlace interference can be suppressed when a played back image is displayed on an LCD monitor.","An image signal display system according to the present invention is provided with a variable length decoding section for performing variable length decoding on an input image signal coded by a hybrid coding method that uses both intra-frame coding and interframe coding, and generating motion vector information, coefficient information, time information and header information. The image signal display system is further provided with: an inverse quantization section for performing inverse quantization on the coefficient information output from the variable length decoding section; and a DC level distribution information detection section for temporarily storing only DC component information of the inversely quantized coefficient information output from the inverse quantization section, generating distribution information of the DC component information corresponding to one frame, and outputting the generated distribution information. The image signal display system is further provided with: an inverse DCT section for performing inverse DCT on the inversely quantized coefficient information output from the inverse quantization section; and a motion compensation section for performing motion compensation based on the inversely discrete-cosine-transformed coefficient information output from the inverse DCT section and the motion vector information, and generating a first output image signal.

Consequently, image analysis conventionally performed after decoding is unnecessary, so that the overall processing amount can be reduced and the apparatus scale can be reduced. In addition, even in the case where an LCD monitor is used as the display device, high quality display is realizable so as to be similar to the use of a TV monitor or a CRT monitor as the display device.","Preferred embodiments of the image signal decoder of the present invention will hereinafter be described with reference to  to .","[First Embodiment]",{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0040","num":"0039"},"figref":"FIG. 1"},"In , the output terminal of a variable length decoding section  to which a coded image signal is input is connected to the input terminal of an interframe motion determination section  and to the input terminal of an inverse quantization section .

The threshold value determination section  counts the number of motion vector data whose values are the threshold value or more, and determines based on the number whether it is necessary to control the interframe motion or not.","The control signal generation section  receives the result of the determination from the threshold value determination section . When the received determination result is that the control is necessary because the interframe motion is large, the control signal generation section  generates a control signal to suspend the decoding by the variable length decoding section , and outputs the generated control signal.

The stored motion vector information, coefficient information and header information are each read out and transmitted to the motion determination section , and whether an interframe motion is present or absent is determined.","In a scene where the interframe motion is large, the prediction error is large because the accuracy of the motion compensation in the coding is low, so that the value of the generated DCT coefficient data is high. Consequently, when the quantization is performed at a quantization level similar to other scenes where the motion is small, the number of bits is large.

The DC level distribution information detection section  temporarily stores only DC component information of the DCT coefficient information restored by the inverse quantization section , and produces DC component level distribution information (e.g. information such as the maximum value, the minimum value and the average value of the DC component) corresponding to one frame.","On the DCT coefficient information restored by the inverse quantization section , inverse DCT is performed by the inverse DCT section , so that the DCT coefficient information is converted into the original pixel value information which was converted into the DCT coefficient information through orthogonal transformation. When the pixel value information converted by the inverse DCT section  is that of the I frame, the pixel value information is output without undergoing the motion compensation by the motion compensation section . When the pixel value information is that of the P frame or the B frame, the pixel value information undergoes the motion compensation by the motion compensation section  by use of the motion vector information extracted by the variable length decoding section , and is successively output in accordance with the time information extracted by the variable length decoding section . The coding mode, in the coding, of the pixel value information converted by the inverse DCT section  is determined based on the header information extracted by the variable length decoding section .","When the pixel value information output from the motion compensation section  is that of an I frame or a P frame, it is temporarily stored in the frame buffer  so that it is used for the next motion compensation. The frame buffer  has a capacity capable of storing a maximum of two frames of reference data so that bidirectionally predictive-coded data can be decoded. The frame buffer  has a ring buffer configuration in which when the newest frame data is input, the newest frame data is stored by overwriting the frame data being oldest in time with it.","Based on the DC level distribution information of the DC component information input from the DC level distribution information detection section , the output signal correction section  performs output signal correction on the pixel value information output from the motion compensation section . For example, the pixel value information output from the motion compensation section  is corrected (contrast correction or level correction) by the level correction section  shown in  so that the maximum and the minimum levels of the input signal are the same as the maximum and the minimum output levels that can be displayed by the display device, respectively, based on the DC level distribution information of the DC component information input from the DC level distribution information detection section . The pixel value information (image signal) output from the level correction section  is converted into RGB signals by the RGB conversion section . On the RGB signals, input and output correction (gamma correction) responsive to characteristics of the display device is performed by the gamma correction section , and are output to the image display section .","According to the image signal display system of the fourth embodiment, the DC level distribution information detection section produces DC level distribution information corresponding to one frame in decoding, and the distribution information is used for the output signal correction of the decoded image signal. Consequently, image analysis conventionally performed after decoding is unnecessary, so that the overall processing amount can be reduced and the apparatus scale can be reduced.","According to the image signal decoder of the present invention, in decoding a coded image signal and displaying the decoded image signal, the frame rate is decreased by suspending the decoding by the variable length decoding section when the interframe motion is large. Consequently, the formation of afterimages can be suppressed when a played back image is displayed on the LCD monitor.","According to the image signal display system of the present invention, even in a display system using the LCD monitor as the display device, the quality of display is improved to a level equal to that provided by the display system using the TV monitor or the CRT monitor as the display device. In addition, since the output signal correction section is included to perform output signal correction on the decoded image signal, image analysis is unnecessary. Consequently, the overall processing amount of the image signal display system can be reduced and the system scale can be reduced.","Although the present invention has been described in terms of the presently preferred embodiments, it is to be understood that such disclosure is not to be interpreted as limiting.
