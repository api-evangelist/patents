Field of the Invention","The present invention relates to an immunostimulatory compositions comprising liposome-encapsulated oligonucleotide and epitopes.","2. Description of the Related Art","Epitope-based peptide vaccines are extensively studied that are pivotal for inducing and regulating immune responses through their binding ability to B cell receptor (BCR) and MHC as B-cell epitope and T-cell epitope for protecting infectious and malignant diseases (1-3). Chemically inactivated vaccines are widely used in the clinics, however, the vaccines have disadvantages, such as the risk of virus reactivation, the cost for the maintenance of the vaccine stability, leading to autoimmune diseases, not support to sufficient protection in some of vaccines (1, 3, 4). For overcoming the theses disadvantages, synthetic peptides were developed for last 30 years to manipulate of the immune responses through the use of epitopes designed for stimulating particular subsets of lymphocytes, leading to selective B- and T-cell responses. Therefore, peptide vaccines have gained attention as potentially useful prophylaxis and therapy for anticancer vaccines (5, 6) and infectious diseases such as influenza virus (3), malaria (7), hepatitis B (8), and HIV (9). Although peptide vaccines were actively studied in various animal models, their efficacy is limited to treat human. To improve the peptide vaccine efficacy, liposomes are evaluated for delivery of vaccines (10) and adjuvants such as flagella (11) and CpG-DNA (12) were formulated for enhancing the magnitude of immune responses.","Liposomes as vehicles for delivery have been extensively evaluated in developing vaccines to enhance cytotoxic T lymphocytes (CTL) responses (10, 13). Encapsulated liposomes can protect from environment and deliver to target cells. pH-sensitive liposomes such as phosphatidyl-\u03b2-oleoyl-\u03b3-palmitoyl ethanolamine (DOPE, dioleryl phosphatidylethanolamine)\/cholesteryl hemisuccinate (CHEMS) are characteristics release of contents into the cytosol and lipid intermixing at low pH (5.0) (14). Investigators have shown that the pH-sensitive liposomes improve antigen delivery to the cytosol and induction of CTL responses (15). Furthermore, effective antigen specific CTL responses are reported in mice immunized with CTL epitopes synthesized from Hantaan nucleocapsid protein (M6) or human papilloma virus E7 encapsulated in pH-sensitive liposomes (16). To improve uptake of antigens by macrophages and dendritic cells, cationic liposomes were used as vehicles for delivery. The CTL response and antibody production are enhanced by encapsulated cationic liposomes such as lipofectamine, DC-Chol, DC-Chol\/DOPE, EPC\/SA\/C etc (10).","Although liposomes are potent vehicles for delivering antigen to APCs, it is investigated to enhance of immunogenicity and adjuvanticity. The immunostimulatory activities of CpG-DNA have gained attention as a potentially useful form of therapeutics for immunoadjuvants compare to other immune-stimulating agents such as flagella, lipid A, cytokines etc (17, 18). Several investigators have shown that CpG-DNA upregulates antigen-presenting cell activity, Th1 immune response, immunoglobulin (Ig) isotype switching (19-21). The immunostimulatory activities as a potent adjuvant are enhanced by liposome-encapsulated CpG-DNA. Suzuki et al., show that CpG-DNA encapsulated in cationic liposomes induces expression of IL-12 and IFN-\u03b3 and CpG-DNA-liposome coencapsulated with ovalbumin (OVA) caused the induction of OVA-specific CTLs, which exhibited potent cytotoxicity against OVA-expressing tumor (22). In addition, SSCL improves the uptake by B cells, dendritic cells, and macrophages and coencapsulation of CpG-DNA with OVA magnified the Ag-specific IFN-\u03b3 and IgG production (23). Furthermore, Li et al., investigate that CpG-DNA and HER-2\/neu-derived peptide coencapsulated in DSPC\/Chol liposomes enhances the CTL response and IgG production (24).","Phosphorothioate-modified CpG-DNAs (PS-DNA), which is a sulfur substitution for the nonbridging oxygens in the backbone providing its nuclease resistance and efficient uptake into cells, have been used for clinical applications (25). However, several studies indicated that PS-DNA induces backbone-related side effects such as transient splenomegaly, lymphoid follicle destruction, and arthritis (26-28). Therefore, investigators developed the natural counterpart of the phosphodiester bond CpG-DNA (PO-DNA) to induce optimal innate immune responses without severe side effects. In contrast to PS-DNA, effects of PO-DNA were not seen in human cells. However, inductions of effective immune responses are reported in human cells stimulated with PO-DNA and non-CpG-DNA encapsulated in liposomes (DOTAP, lipofectin) (29, 30).","In previous studies, we identified the natural phosphodiester bond CpG-DNA (PO-DNA) through computer-assisted analysis of genomic DNA and screened the genomic DNA sequences of with immunostimulatory activity (31). Our experimental analyses demonstrate that a potent PO-DNA, namely MB-ODN 4531(O), containing CpG motifs has functional effects as a powerful adjuvant for the induction of Ag-driven Th1 responses without severe side effects (31, 32). In this study, we compared the ability of the PO-DNA (MB-ODN 4531(O)) encapsulated in several liposomes to stimulate immune responses in human and mice cells. Further, we show that PO-DNA (MB-ODN 4531(O)) and several peptides coencapsulated in DOPE\/CHEMS liposomes significantly enhanced the peptide-specific IgG production. These results suggest that peptide vaccine efficacy were improved by delivery with DOPE\/CHEMS liposomes and adjuvants effect with MB-ODN 4531(O), which can be promptly used for application in pandemic of infectious diseases, development of therapeutic antibody, and exposure of bioterrorism agents.","Throughout this application, various publications and patents are referred and citations are provided in parentheses.

The microphysiometer is a device for determining the cell's environment-acidifying rate using LAPS (light-addressable potentiometric sensor). The change of acidifying rate may be used as an indicator for binding of the candidate antibody and protein antigen binding (33).","Binding capacity of the candidate antibody to the protein antigen may be determined by an real-time BIA (bimolecular interaction analysis) (34, 35). A BIA is a real-time analyzing technique for the specific interaction without labeling of interactants (e.g., BIAcore\u2122). The change of SPR (surface plasmon resonance) is used as an indicator of real-time reaction between the molecules.","In still another aspect of this invention, there is provided a method for preparing an antibody against a protein antigen comprising the steps of:","(a) encapsulating (i) an immunostimulatory oligonucleotide and (ii) a peptide of the protein antigen as a candidate material for an epitope into a liposome containing an anionic surfactant and a neutral phospholipid;","(b) immunizing a non-human animal with said liposome-encapsulated (i) the immunostimulatory oligonucleotide and (ii) the peptide as the candidate material for the epitope; and","(c) selecting a peptide epitope having immunogenicity by analyzing the immune response of said immunized non-human animal;","(d) producing the antibody by immunizing a non-human animal with said selected peptide epitope.","According to the present invention, the step of obtaining an antibody from an immunized animal is performed by varied method known to those skilled in the art, including ethanol precipitation method, ion exchange adsorption chromatography or protein A or protein G-column chromatography. Alternatively, pure immunoglobulins may be isolated from the mammalian plasma through adsorption chromatography using specific antigen bound agarose beads. Still alternatively, the information of immunoglobulin may be acquired from the cDNA library having genetic information of the antibody protein obtained from a peripheral blood lymph node or a B cell. Based on said information, the immunoglobulin may be prepared in genetically engineered way. The genetic recombinant immunoglobulin protein prepared by above described method contains base sequence of mammal's immunoglobulin amino acid or humanized genetic recombinant immunoglobulin protein with partial mutation thereof (Vaughan T J, et al. Human antibodies design. Nature Biotech 16:535-539 (1998)). The purified antibody may be stored on ice before use. Furthermore, the method of the present invention may additionally comprise a step of generating a monoclonal antibody, a humanized antibody or an affinity maturated antibody through capturing B cells from the immunized animals.","In still another aspect of this invention, there is provided a peptide vaccine composition against an influenza A virus comprising the amino acid sequence selected from the group consisting of SEQ ID NO:1 to SEQ ID NO:9 and SEQ ID NO:19 to SEQ ID NO:37.","In still another aspect of this invention, there is provided a peptide vaccine composition against human integrin protein \u03b24 comprising the amino acid sequence selected from the group consisting of SEQ ID NO:42 to SEQ ID NO:46.","In still another aspect of this invention, there is provided a peptide vaccine composition against a hepatocarcinoma comprising the amino acid sequence selected from the group consisting of SEQ ID NO:10 and SEQ ID NO:11.","In still another aspect of this invention, there is provided a peptide vaccine composition against a hepatitis c virus comprising the amino acid sequence of SEQ ID NO:12.","In still another aspect of this invention, there is provided a peptide vaccine composition against a RSV (respiratory syncytial virus) comprising the amino acid sequence of SEQ ID NO:13 and SEQ ID NO:38 to SEQ ID NO:41.","As the peptide vaccines of the present invention are mentioned in describing the immunostimulatory composition, they are omitted herein to avoid excessive overlaps.","In still another aspect of this invention, there is provided a method for preventing or treating influenza A virus infectious diseases, cancers, hepatocarcinomas, hepatitis C or RSV (respiratory syncytial virus) infectious diseases.","The features and advantages of the present invention will be summarized as follows:","(a) The present invention provides a composition for enhancing an immune response, an epitope having immunogenicity, screening and preparing methods thereof, an antibody to a peptide antigen and screening and preparing methods thereof.","(b) The present invention may be effectively used for preventing or treating diverse immune-deficiency diseases such as cancer, influenza virus, hepatitis C virus and RSV (respiratory syncytial virus) by enhancing immune responses.","The present invention will now be described in further detail by examples. It would be obvious to those skilled in the art that these examples are intended to be more concretely illustrative and the scope of the present invention as set forth in the appended claims is not limited to or by the examples.","ODNs (Oligodeoxynucleotides) were synthesized from Samchully Pharm (Seoul, Korea).

After 10 days, blood was obtained by heart punching method and the sera were collected through blood cell precipitation by centrifugation. From the collected sera, the titer of anti-HEL antibodies (total IgG, IgG1, IgG2a) was analyzed by ELISA.","<4-2> ELISA","The mice were sacrificed 10 day after the injection.

To measure the IgG, IgG1, and IgG2a titer, we coated the 96-well immunoplates (Nalgen Nunc International) with 10 \u03bcg\/ml of HEL, and then blocked them with PBST containing 1% BSA. The sera were added to the top row of each plate, and serial 1:3 dilutions of PBST were then placed into subsequent rows. We incubated the plates for 4 h at room temperature and washed them with PBST. Next, we added goat anti-mouse IgG antibody-, anti-mouse IgG1 antibody-, or anti-mouse IgG2a antibody-conjugated with horseradish peroxidase and incubated the plates for 2 h. The colorimetric assay was developed with 1-Step ABTS (Pierce Biotechnology Inc., Rockford, Ill., USA), and we used a Labsystems Multiskan microplate reader (GMI Inc., Ramsey, Mich., USA) to measure the absorbance at 405 nm (19).","The humoral immune response of the BALB\/c mice intraperitoneally immunized by HEL-MB-ODN 4531 and liposome complex were investigated. The injection of HEL-MB-ODN4531-liposome complex increase the amount of antibodies greater than the injection of HEL only, HEL-MB-ODN 4531 mixture or HEL-liposome complex which confirmed the immunoadjuvant effect of a MB-ODN 4531-liposome complex in humoral immune responses. Incomplete Freund's adjuvant is a representative immunoadjuvant which has been used since 60 years ago. But it has a limitation that it induces no cellular immunostimulatory effect and cannot be applied to humans. MB-ODN 4531-liposome complex proved to act as an immunoadjuvant increasing humoral immunity as well as inducing cellular immune responses through stimulating immune cells. In addition, MB-ODN 4531-liposome complexes are effective in Th1-immune response-specific IgG2a antibody production.","<4-3> Mice and Immunization","Mice were maintained under specific-pathogen-free conditions.

As expected, IgG-producing ability of hTM4SF5R2-3 peptide and MB-ODN 4531(O) coencapsulated in DOPE:CHEMS complex was absolutely dependent on TLR9 because TLR9 knockout mice did not produce IgG when injected with hTM4SF5R2-3 peptide and MB-ODN 4531(O) coencapsulated in DOPE:CHEMS complex (). In contrast, injection of mice with HEL in combination with IFA was found to increase IgG production from wild type mice and TLR9 knockout mice ().","<14-5> Effect of MHC class II-Mediated Presentation and Th1 Differentiation on CpG-DNA-Peptide-Liposome-Induced Humoral Immune Response","To evaluate the kinetics of IgG production in response to epitope and MB-ODN 4531(O) coencapsulated DOPE:CHEMS complex immunization, we injected BALB\/c mice i.p. with hTM4SF5R2-3 peptide and MB-ODN 4531(O) coencapsulated in DOPE:CHEMS complex three times with a 10 day interval. The BALB\/c mice produced larger amounts of the peptide-specific IgG (IgG2a) in the secondary and tertiary responses (). Next, we investigated the requirement of MHC class II-mediated presentation for IgG production in response to hTM4SF5R2-3 peptide and MB-ODN 4531(O) coencapsulated in DOPE:HEMS complex. As shown in , depletion of CD4 cells by injection BALB\/c mice i.p. with anti-CD4 antibody dramatically reduced the peptide-specific IgG production. Further, we also observed the reduction of IgG and IgG2a production in MHC class II knockout mice and OT-II transgenic mice in response to hTM4SF5R2-3 peptide and MB-ODN 4531(O) coencapsulated in DOPE:CHEMS complex immunization (, ). We also examined the involvement of Th1 differentiation for IgG production in response to hTM4SF5R2-3 peptide and MB-ODN 4531(O) coencapsulated in DOPE:CHEMS complex immunization. The reduction of IgG and IgG2a production was detected in the STAT4 knockout mice, STAT4 promotes the differentiation of the T cells into Th1 cells, in response to hTM4SF5R2-3 peptide and MB-ODN 4531(O) coencapsulated in DOPE:CHEMS complex immunization (). However, the effect of STATE knockout on hTM4SF5R2-3 peptide and MB-ODN 4531(O) coencapsulated in DOPE:CHEMS complex-induced IgG production was not observed as shown in ). These results suggest that production of IgG (IgG2a) requires in CD4 cells, MHC class II-mediated presentation and Th1 differentiation from B cell epitope and MB-ODN 4531(O) coencapsulated in DOPE:CHEMS complex immunization.","After BALB\/c mice injected i.p. with hTM4SF5R2-3 peptide (50 \u03bcg) and MB-ODN 4531(O) (50 \u03bcg) coencapsulated in DOPE:CHEMS complex on three occasions at 10 day intervals, the hybridoma cells producing anti-hTM4SF5R2-3 peptide-specific mAbs were screened according to the standard hybridoma technique.

The anti-hTM4SF5R2-3 peptide mAb (IgG2a) was purified from ascites fluid by a Protein A column chromatography (Amersham Pharmacia Biotech, Piscataway, N.J., USA).","<16-1> Analysis of TM4SF5 Expression in Human Hepatoma Cells","Human hepatocarcinoma cell lines (Huh-7) were purchased from American Type Culture Collection (ATCC, Manassas, Va., USA). Human hepatic cell lines (SNU-398, SNU-423, SNU-739 and SNU-761) were purchased from Korean Cell Line Bank (Seoul, Korea). The Huh-7, SNU-398, SNU-423, SNU-739 and SNU-761 cells were cultured in RPMI 1640 media containing 10% FBS (fetal bovine serum; Hyclone, Logan, Utah, USA). Human normal hepatic cells (Promo Cell, Heidelberg, Germany) were cultured according to the manufacturer's specifications. All cells were incubated at 37\u00b0 C. under 5% COand 95% air condition. To investigate hTM4SF5 mRNA expression, RT-PCR was performed. Total RNA was isolated using RNeasy Mini Kit (Qiagen, Germantown, Md., USA) and preparation of cDNA was carried out by the process previously described (40). Standard 25 PCR cycles were performed using the following primer sets: human \u03b2-actin, 5\u2032-GGGTCAGAAGGATTCCTATG-3\u2032 and 5\u2032-CCTTAATGTCACGCACGATTT-3\u2032(500 bp); hTM4SF5. Huh-7 and SNU-761 cells showed high level of TM4SF5 mRNA expression ().","<16-2> Recognition of TM4SF5 Protein by Monoclonal Antibody Recognizing TM4SF5 R2-3 Peptides (FACS Analysis)","To investigate the binding of antibody, hepatocarcinoma cells were washed in PBS containing 0.1% BSA and incubated for 20 min at 4\u00b0 C. with 10 \u03bcg\/ml of human IgG (sigma) for blocking of Fc receptor-binding. After blocking, cells were cultured with purified anti-TM4SF5 R2-3 peptide antibody (Example 15) for 1 h. And then, the cells were washed in PBS containing 0.1% BSA and cultured with FITC-conjugated goat anti-mouse IgG antibody (BD Biosciences) for 30 min at 4\u00b0 C. It was confirmed that purified anti-TM4SF5 R2-3 peptide antibody bound to Huh-7 and SNU-761 cells which were proved to express TM4SF5 mRNA ().","<17-1> Cell Growth Inhibition by Anti-TM4SF5 R2-3 Peptide Monoclonal Antibody","Growth of human hepatocarcinoma cells (Huh-7 and SNU-739) were analyzed by MTT assay after 72 h treatment of anti-TM4SF5 R2-3 peptide antibody (10 \u03bcg\/ml).","The hepatocarcinoma cells were incubated in 48-well plate for 72 h, 3-(4,5-dimethylthiazole-2-yl)-2,5-diphenyl tetrazolium bromide (MU, Sigma-Aldrich) solution was added to each plate and incubated for more 4 h at 37\u00b0 C. After the media was removed, formazan crystals were solubilized in DMSO. The color development was monitored at 570 nm with a reference wavelength of 650 nm using a spectrophotometer (SpectraMax250, Molecular Devices, Downingtown, Pa., USA). It was verified by MTT assay that the growth of Huh-7 cells expressing TM4SF5 was inhibited when they were treated with the anti-TM4SF5 R2-3 peptide antibody (). In contrast, the cells not expressing TM4SF5 (SNU-739) were not affected ().","<17-2> Regulation of Cell Cycles by Anti-TM4SF5 R2-3 Peptide Antibody","Hepatocarcinoma cells (Huh-7 and SNU-739) were treated with the anti-TM4SF5 R2-3 peptide antibody (10 \u03bcg\/ml) for 72 h and the cell cycles were observed. DNA contents were measured through incubating in PI (propidium iodide) (20 \u03bcg\/ml) dissolved in RNase (200 \u03bcg\/ml)-containing PBS. The cells were stained at room temperature for 30 min and analyzed by FACScan flow cytometer (BD biosciences). Data were analyzed by ModFit LT 3.0 software for cell cycle distribution.","The distribution of cell cycle stages in each population was compared. It was observed that the S phage of Huh-7 cell expressing TM4SF5 was arrested when they were treated with the anti-TM4SF5 R2-3 peptide antibody. In contrast, the cell cycle of SNU-739 which did not express TM4SF5 was not affected ().","<17-3> Inhibition of Hepatocarcinoma Cells by Anti-TM4SF5 R2-3 Peptide Antibody","It had been discovered that TM4SF5 expressing hepatocarcinoma cells lost cell-cell contact inhibition capacity to develop to be hepatocarcinoma cells (41). While TM4SF5 expressing hepatocarcinoma cells show abnormal actin bundling, in cells not expressing TM4SF5 the distinct outline of stress fiber supporting an overspread polygonal shape is detected by actin staining (41). Therefore, we treated the anti-TM4SF5 R2-3 peptide antibody (10 \u03bcg\/ml) to the hepatocarcinoma cells (Huh-7 and SNU-739) for 72 h and observed the actin.","The cells were cultured on glass coverslips in 12-well plates 1 day before the anti-hTM4SF5 antibody (10 \u03bcg\/ml) treatment. After cells were treated the antibody for 72 h, the cells were fixed with 4% paraformaldehyde, permeabilized with 0.1% Triton X-100, and stained with phalloidin-conjugated with rhodamine (Molecular Probes, Eugene, Oreg., USA). Nuclei were stained with Hoechst No. 33258. The mounted samples were scanned with an LSM 510 META NLO (Carl Zeiss, Jena, Germany).","When the hepatoma cells expressing TM4SF5 (Huh-7) were treated with the hTM4SF5 R2-3 peptide-specific antibody, the actin had a distinct outline of stress fiber supporting an overspread polygonal shape as in the cell which does not express TM4SF5, which indicates that the antibody is targeted to the hTM4SF5 expressing cells (). These results suggest that the antibody generated by MB-ODN4531 (O) and hTM4SF5 R2-3 coencapsulated liposome (DOPE:CHEMS) may be effectively used to detect hTM4SF5 proteins, and that antibody-mediated hTM4SF5 targeting is related to functional change of hepatoma cells, which enables the cell growth to be reduced to change the diversity of cell functions.","<18-1> Xenograft Experiment in Nude Mice","5\u00d710Hepatocarcinoma cells (Huh-7) were subcutaneously injected in the right flank of nude mice. After the cancer grew to 5 mm in diameter, the samples were divided to three groups of PBS, normal IgG and anti-TM4SF5 R2-3 peptide antibody group (n=5\/group). Each group was injected with PBS and each antibody (100 mg\/Kg mouse) on five occasions at 3 day intervals. Total volume of the cancer was measured using a calipers during five week observation. Analysis of xenograft experiments revealed that anti-TM4SF5R2-3 peptide antibody targeting of hepatocarcinoma cells is sufficient to decrease tumor growth in vivo (and ).","<19-1> Mouse Tumor Allograft Experiment","Four-week-old BALB\/c mice were injected i.p. with MB-ODN 4531(O)-TM4SF5R2-3 peptide-liposome (DOPE:CHEMS) complex three times at 10 day intervals. 10 days after the third immunization, 5\u00d710BNL-HCC cells containing 50% Matrigel were subcutaneously injected in the right flank of the BALB\/c mice. Total volume of the tumor was measured using a calipers during seven week observation. Mice immunized with MB-ODN 4531(O)-TM4SF5R2-3 peptide-liposome (DOPE:CHEMS) complex had a significant reduction in tumor volume as compared with untreated mice (and ).","Having described a preferred embodiment of the present invention, it is to be understood that variants and modifications thereof falling within the spirit of the invention may become apparent to those skilled in this art, and the scope of this invention is to be determined by appended claims and their equivalents.",{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0216","num":"0000"},"ul":{"@attributes":{"id":"ul0001","list-style":"none"},"li":["1.
