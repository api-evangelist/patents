{"@attributes":{"id":"description"},"RELAPP":[{},{}],"heading":["CROSS REFERENCE TO RELATED APPLICATIONS","GOVERNMENT INTEREST STATEMENT","FIELD OF THE INVENTION","BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION","SUMMARY OF THE INVENTION","DETAILED DESCRIPTION OF THE INVENTION"],"p":["This application is a Divisional of U.S. application Ser. No. 11\/272,032, filed on Nov. 14, 2005 now U.S. Pat. No. 7,543,480, which claims priority from the U.S. Provisional Application U.S. Ser. No. 60\/627,927, filed on Nov. 15, 2004 which is fully incorporated herein.","This invention was made in whole or in part with government support under grant number R43 DK063727 awarded by the National Institutes of Health. The government may have certain rights in the invention.","The present invention relates to measuring and detecting of properties of particles for example in suspension, for example by using ultrasonic techniques.","Ultrasonic methods and systems may be used to measure the concentration and other properties of suspended particles or other materials, including, for example, biologic materials. For example, there is a need to measure concentration of human islets in preparations for human transplantation. These measurements can be combined with separate measures of the viability of the islets to determine the number of viable and dead cells in a preparation. There is also a need for systems that can measure properties of small particles on a nanoscale.","Embodiments of the present invention may include, for example, devices, systems and methods for measuring and detecting properties of a variety of particles or other materials, such as cells, in suspension. For example, to measure velocity of the particles\/cells, their concentration and\/or size by using an ultrasonic system based on the Doppler effect.","In some embodiments, narrow-band acoustic (e.g. ultrasonic) interrogating energy may be introduced to a focal zone within a sample containing particles to be tested to generate high levels of acoustic energy in a small volume and in a narrow frequency range. This may produce high levels of backscatter from this volume. The suspensions of particles may include particles in motion due to stirring or bulk flows as in a manufacturing process. The high levels of interrogating signals in the focal volume may induce velocities due to acoustic (Eckart) streaming. Particle velocities due to any of these sources may allow measurement of acoustic backscatter at frequencies differing from that of the interrogating energy by the Doppler effect. Backscattered time-domain signals may be converted by a Fast Fourier Transform (\u201cFFT\u201d) algorithm to a high-resolution, narrow-band power spectrum, the shape of which provides the information about the particle suspension.","Embodiments of the invention may include processing of the receiving signal and determining properties such as velocities and size and concentration of particles from a high precision power spectrum of the signal. In addition some embodiments of the invention may include back wall reflection calibration, for example a system self-check.","In the following description, various aspects of the present invention will be described. For purposes of explanation, specific configurations and details are set forth in order to provide a thorough understanding of the present invention. However, it will also be apparent to one skilled in the art that the present invention may be practiced without the specific details presented herein. Furthermore, well-known features may be omitted or simplified in order not to obscure the present invention. Various examples are given throughout this description. These are merely descriptions of specific embodiments of the invention. The scope of the invention is not limited to the examples given.","Unless specifically stated otherwise, as apparent from the following discussions, it is appreciated that throughout the specification, discussions utilizing terms such as \u201cprocessing,\u201d \u201ccomputing,\u201d \u201ccalculating,\u201d \u201cdetermining,\u201d \u201cderiving\u201d or the like, refer to the action and\/or processes of a processor, computer or computing system, or similar electronic or hardware computing device, that manipulates and\/or transforms data represented as physical, such as electronic quantities within the computing system's registers and\/or memories into other data similarly represented as physical quantities within the computing system's memories, registers or other such information storage, transmission or display devices.","The processes and displays presented herein are not inherently related to any particular computer, measurement device, electronic device or other apparatus. The desired structure for a variety of these systems will appear from the description below. In addition, embodiments of the present invention are not described with reference to any particular programming language, machine code, etc. It will be appreciated that a variety of programming languages, mathematical tools, electronic measurements tools, machine codes, etc. may be used to implement the teachings of the invention as described herein. Embodiments of the invention may be included on a medium or article such as a hard disc, CD, DVD, \u201cdisc on key\u201d, memory stick, or other memory unit having stored thereon instruction that when executed implement an embodiment of the invention, or having files or data corresponding to effects stored thereon.","Methods such as Ultrasonic Pulsed Doppler (\u201cUSPD\u201d) techniques may be based on the backscatter or reflection of ultrasonic acoustic energy from moving scattering objects that have an acoustic impedance contrast with the medium in which they are suspended. This acoustic contrast may be due, for example, to a difference in the density or the compressibility of the particles from that of the fluid, or both. These differences may give rise to a difference between the acoustic impedances\u2014the product of the particle or fluid density and sound wavespeed, which product is proportional to the square root of the product of the density and the compressibility.","One principle of the measurement may be that the amount of acoustical energy backscattered from a given volume of a suspension may increase with the concentration of particles or cells with an impedance contrast within that volume. Thus, the strength of a signal backscattered from a volume insonified by an ultrasonic beam may be proportional to the concentration of suspended material in that volume.","In the long wavelength limit where the wavelength of the acoustical energy being scattered may be greater than the size of a weakly scattering (nonresonant) particle, i.e., \u03bb\u22672\u03c0a where \u03bb may represent the wavelength and \u201ca\u201d may represent the particle radius, the backscattered energy may be due to Rayleigh scattering and it may depend on the contrast between the compressibility and density of the particle and that of the fluid suspension medium, and the volume of the particle. For example, at the typical ultrasonic frequency of 15 MHz, the acoustic wavelength is 100 \u03bcm. For cells or other particles on the order of 10 \u03bcm or smaller the ratio 2\u03c0a\/\u03bb may be small (\u22660.6) and the backscatter has these properties. At higher frequencies and\/or for larger particles, the backscattered power may become a function of other particle properties which may complicate interpretation of backscatter data.","Embodiments of the invention may also detect the velocity of motions of the fluid containing the backscattering particles. This motion may give rise to a shift in the frequency of the backscattered acoustic power due to the Doppler effect, wherein the fractional shift in the received frequency is twice the ratio of the velocity along the line of sight to the particle from the sound source and receiver to the velocity of sound in the fluid. For example, the ultrasonic energy at frequency fincident on a scattering object may be related to the velocity v at which the object is moving away from a transducer. The backscattered ultrasonic energy received may have the frequency f\u2212\u0394f, where \u0394f is given by the well-known formula: \u0394f\/f=2v\/c","where c is the velocity of sound in the fluid medium, approximately 1500 m\/sec for water.","Embodiments of the invention may be used to measure, for example, the concentrations of a variety of particles of different sizes in suspension. Such embodiments may measure concentrations in the range from a few tenths of a percent to about 40% or more by volume of cells (\u226710\/ml), cell aggregates (spheroids, \u2267300\/ml), Islets of Langerhans (human and murine, \u2267300\/ml), 200 nm diameter particles in an emulsion, and polymer beads with diameters as small as 40 nm, and nanoparticles on the order of 1-10 nm diameter. Measurement accuracy and precision on the order of 10% can be achieved.","Embodiments of the invention may for example allow concentration measurements of any particle species with acoustic contrast with a medium in which it is suspended. The measurement may be minimally invasive and it may be used without contact with the fluid being measured. Furthermore, backscatter spectra which may be generated by embodiments of the invention may provide information about the nature of the particles. For example, multiple spectra peaks may imply the existence of more than one type of particle and the velocities with which these particles move may provide information about them and the viscosity of the suspensions.","Particle movement or velocities may be generated in a suspension in a number of ways. For example, suspensions may be stirred or otherwise moved, creating a generally cylindrical pattern of motions. Downward motion may be created by the negative buoyancy of larger and more dense particles, which may tend to sink or precipitate out of solution. Fluid flows may also be generated by the interrogating ultrasound signal itself, which may be due to ultrasonic streaming or Eckart streaming, which is the generation of motion in open volumes of fluid by ultrasound, or simply \u201cstreaming.\u201d For example, if an ultrasonic beam with high intensity is incident on a liquid, the liquid may experience acceleration due to nonlinear effects and a macroscopic flow away from the transducer may develop. An advantage to using streaming may be the simplicity of not having to stir the suspension by other methods. In one embodiment of the present invention an advantage may be obtained such that particle velocities required to make the measurement arise due to ultrasonic streaming may be induced by the interrogating ultrasound itself.","Energy backscattered at frequencies other than the interrogating frequency may be easier to detect than that energy backscattered at the same frequency. This is because in a small chamber there may be reflections from walls which may be many orders of magnitude larger than backscatter from the particles. Separation, identification, and measurement of the small reflections from microscopic objects such as islets, cells, and submicron particles in the presence of the larger reflections at the same frequency may be difficult. In the parlance of detection theory, a very large dynamic range may be required in the presence of substantial measurement \u201cclutter.\u201d However, when the backscattered energy is at a frequency that differs from that of the original interrogating signal the detection may be simpler because no other significant signals are present at the Doppler-shifted frequencies. Consequently, weak backscatter from low concentrations of scattering particles may be measured in the presence of other signals such as strong wall reflections or the original interrogating signal itself.","When using embodiments of the present invention, backscatter from a suspension of cells may occur in a band of Doppler-shifted frequencies, due in part to the distribution of particle velocities (or more precisely of the components of these velocities in the direction of the line between the scatterer and the transducer). The shape of the reflectivity spectrum (e.g. backscattered power vs. frequency) may contain additional information about the particles. For example, the maximum velocity that can be induced by a given level of stirring or acoustical streaming depends on the viscosity of a sample, which may depend on size distribution of the suspended scatterers. Likewise, under the influence of streaming alone, particles of different size may attain different velocities depending on possible particle interactions with the high acoustic fields or differing drag coefficients. In such cases, the reflection spectrum may include multiple peaks corresponding to the particle sizes.",{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0044","num":"0043"},"figref":"FIG. 1","b":["100","101","102","103","104","115","100","105","113","112","107","100","112"]},"System  may be used for measurements of reflected or backscattered power from, for example, sample  which may include cells, cell aggregates and polymer beads that may be negatively buoyant and may tend to sink the bottom of chamber  unless stirred. Other particles may be measured. System  may optionally include a magnetic or other stirrer bar  which may be used to keep the samples suspended and may also include a precision stirrer motor  which may be used to control stir rate. Magnetic stirrer bar  and\/or precision stirrer motor  may not be used, for example, when neutrally buoyant particles, including most nanoparticles may be measured. The actual rotation rate of the stirrer bar may be measured with for example a precision stroboscope and may be kept, for example, to within 2% of 900 rpm. Any other suitable rotation rate or tolerance may be used. In some embodiments particles in the suspension may be set into motion by the action of a stirrer bar while in other embodiments the particles may be in motion due to bulk fluid flow. Other suitable stirring methods may be used.","System  may also include a water chamber  having a water jacket  with water inlet  and water outlet  for thermal cycling and temperature control. It may be marked to indicate the standard volume used for testing. A cover (not shown) may be placed loosely over the top of chamber  to prevent foreign objects from falling in. A level may also be used to maintain its orientation and avoid asymmetric gravitational effects on the internal flow.","Embodiments of the invention may allow positioning the entire ultrasonic system, e.g., transducer  outside the fluid volume with no contact with the sample. In such case the acoustic power and the return signal may propagate through the wall of the test vessel. This may be arranged if the wall of chamber  allows the propagation of sufficiently high levels of ultrasonic energy through it to generate acoustic streaming within the sample (when necessary) and to allow generation of an adequate backscattered signal from the moving particles that may propagate back across the wall for detection. Such through-wall systems may be used for example where aseptic conditions are required.","In order to minimize the amount of dissolved gas in sample , sample  may be heated to a desired temperature, for example, 37\u00b0 C. and may be held at that temperature for one hour or other period of time. Furthermore it may be then cooled rapidly to a lower temperature, for example, 24\u00b0 C. before measurements are taken. During the measurements sample  may be held at the lower temperature. Any other temperatures and\/or periods of time may be used, and heating and cooling may not be used.","System  may include transducer  which may have for example a resonant flat piezoelectric ceramic crystal and concave elastomeric focusing lens. Other transducers, for example, transducers with shaped piezoelectric elements to create focusing may be used. The resonances, while not very sharp, may be used to maximize the transmitted signals and the reception sensitivities. Transducers may have different diameters and focal lengths, such as for example, 4 mm and focal lengths of 1.6 mm, and an outer diameter of 6 mm and focal lengths of 7 mm. For example, if the focal length of the transducer is on the order of 1.6 mm, the focal volume or focal zone in the vicinity of the focus may be on the order of a cubic millimeter. Any other suitable transducers with any diameters and focal lengths may be used.","A method according to embodiments of the invention may be simple or minimally invasive as it may require a single transducer  in acoustic contact with the sample to both launch the interrogating signal and receive the backscattered signals. Any number of transducers may be used. This may not require physical contact with sample . Test chamber walls  may be acoustically transparent and transducer  may be placed outside sample  volume. This may be desirable when aseptic conditions are desirable.","Transducer  may be for example a pencil type employing a flat piezoelectric crystal with a convex rubber lens to focus the ultrasound energy to a small volume in which large power densities and ultrasonic field gradients are produced. Any other type of transducer that may generate an adequately large ultrasonic pressure signal in the fluid may be used. In one embodiment a focused transducer may be prescribed so that the bulk of the backscattered energy is generated in a small focus volume. This allows the system to be used in a variety of test volumes as long as there are a sufficient number of particles moving through that volume to allow the measurement. Transducer  may be inserted into the side of the test chamber  through for example a hole or other opening.","The fluid and particle streaming may be a flow away from transducer  which may be generated by for example the radiation pressure of the interrogating acoustic energy on the fluid of sample . It and the resulting backscatter may be enhanced by the high levels of acoustic energy in the focal volume due to the large acoustic field there which may be produced by for example focusing. This energy may also be confined to a small frequency range by the use of narrow band interrogating signals, and the power spectrum of the interrogating signal will be strongly peaked at the central frequency of the tone bursts (and also at aliasing frequencies separated from the central frequency by the inverse of the inter-burst repetition rate) This will generate strong Doppler-shifted backscattered signals near (within hundreds to thousands of Hz of) the main peak of the power spectrum. This phenomenon may give rise to movement or velocities of particles in sample , and may help stir the fluid. In some embodiments of the invention streaming may allow performance of the Doppler effect measurements without any other source of velocity. Furthermore streaming may allow measurements and analyzing of particle size.","According to one embodiment of the invention when streaming is used as a source of velocity or movement the resulting spectra may show peaks on the order of a few bins wide and hence may represent a very limited velocity range where the resolution in frequency may be measured by the bin width or bin size\u2014the separation in frequency between the successive frequency points. For example, a peak about 10 bins wide may represent a frequency range of 250 Hz and a velocity range of about only 1 cm\/sec. These may indicate particle motions at the velocity corresponding to the Doppler shift associated with the frequency difference between these peaks and the main peak representing the interrogating signal. Bigger particles may receive more of an acceleration force by for example the acoustic radiation force, and they may also have greater drag. In some embodiments of the invention bin size may be less than 25 Hz, or in another embodiment, the bin size may be 25 Hz, or in another embodiment, the bin size may be 50 Hz, or in another embodiment, the bin size may be roughly 75 Hz, or in another embodiment, the bin size may be roughly 100 Hz, or in another embodiment, the bin size may be roughly 125 Hz, or in another embodiment, the bin size may be roughly 150 Hz, or in another embodiment, the bin size may reach roughly 200 Hz.","Another embodiment of the invention may include a vertical transducer as is shown in . Referring to , transducer  may be oriented vertically and may enter the chamber  from above. The movement or velocities generated by streaming and gravity may tend to add, yielding larger downward velocities directly ahead of transducer . Furthermore, with or without stirring, the flow field in the cylinder in this geometry may tend to be downward in the center of the volume and upward around the sides. Consequently, almost all the backscatter sensed by the transducer may be from particles moving away from it in the focal volume. Compared to spectra for measurements with streaming alone, these may have more pronounced structure and greater backscattered power.","System  may include signal generator . Signal generator  may create a signal that is projected into the fluid of sample  by transducer  (also referred herein as an interrogating signal). The signal may for example include a series of tone bursts, for example, of equal length at the selected center frequency. For example, frequencies between 7 and 20 MHz and tone burst lengths from 20 to 200 cycles may be used. Other frequency ranges and tone burst lengths may be used.","In one embodiment the string of tone bursts of a single frequency may be long, for example, tens of milliseconds while each individual tone burst may be tens of cycles long, or on the order of microseconds in length, repeated every few microseconds. For example, a signal of 40 milliseconds may consist of 5700 bursts of 30 cycles at 16 Mhz, wherein each burst is around 1.9 microseconds in length and repeated every 7 microseconds. In the period in between bursts, also referred to herein as a \u201cgap\u201d, the interrogating signal may be turned off. It is in this interval that the signals may return from the focal zone, e.g., the returning signal may be received during the intervals between the tone bursts comprising the ultrasonic signal. For example, the focal zone may be about 1.6 mm from transducer , so the two-way travel distance to the zone and back is 3.2 mm, and the leading edge of the signal may return to transducer  after \u02dc2 microseconds (3.2 mm\/1500 m\/sec). The returned, backscattered signal may fall between the tone bursts, where the signal is turned off. The signal sent to oscilloscope  may consist of the original interrogating signal with the backscattered energy falling between the interrogating-signal tone bursts.","The interrogating signal may be confined to a small bandwidth, for example, on the order of few hundreds Hz. The small bandwidth, and the fact that the signal may be focused in space, may give rise to high acoustic pressures in the fluid in a narrow bandwidth that may drive the streaming and may produce high levels of interrogating signals and backscattered power from islets, cells, and nanoparticles in a narrow bandwidth. This may allow an embodiment of the invention to work with particles which may have weak backscatter.","The tone bursts may be separated in time by a spacing or gap that may be set by several constraints, for example the signal processing architecture and the dimensions of test chamber . For example, when a single transducer  or  of  is used both to direct the signal to the particles and to receive the backscattered return signal it may be necessary that they do not overlap in time, e.g. the backscattered signals may return to the transducer between the tone bursts. The signals may not return before the next tone burst occurs; they may appear, for example, after the tone burst subsequent to one that created them. Thus the separation between the tone bursts may differ from the two-way acoustic travel time to the focal volume in which most of the reflected energy is generated. Another factor in the separation between the bursts may be the distance to stirrer bar  when the transducer is working downward into the fluid, for example as in . Energy reflected from the stirrer bar  may be received which may include Doppler shifted components that may be distinguished from the desired signal\u2014to coincide with the time of a subsequent tone burst so as not to contribute spurious Doppler shifted energy to the analyzed signal between the tone bursts. Inter burst separations from, for example, about 5 to 20 \u03bcsec may be used. Other inter burst separations times may be used. For example, signal generator model Agilent 33250A, with an internal trigger, may run continuously in the tone burst mode. In one embodiment, tone bursts of peak-to-peak voltage amplitudes from 10 to 250 mVare used, or in another embodiment higher levels are used. Any other suitable signal generator, mode of operation and voltage may be used.","System  may further include a power amplifier . The tone burst signal may be fed to power amplifier  to generate the input signal to transducer . The amplified tone burst train may be then sent to transducer . For example, power amplifier  may be an ENI 607L amplifier which may provide 45 dB of gain. Any other power amplifier providing other adequate gains and interrogating signal levels may be used.","Pulse receiver  may be used as a signal amplifier and limiter to prepare signals from power amplifier  and transducer  for analysis in oscilloscope  and processor . In some embodiments of the invention processor  may be included in oscilloscope . Oscilloscope , which may for example be operated on a PC or workstation platform under, for example, the Windows NT\u2122 operating system, may also perform the functions of averaging and storing individual spectra. Processor  may include components or the functionality of components such as oscilloscope , receiver , amplifier , transducer , or a workstation or PC. These preparations may be done by other suitable equipment such as amplifiers, limiters or any other electronic equipment. For example, a Panametrics 5072 PR pulse receiver and a LeCroy Waverunner 6030 oscilloscope may be used. The pulse receiver may provide amplification that may be needed to boost the relatively weak reflected signals, which may be on the order of nanowatts. Amplifications of 40 dB may be used. Any other amount of gain sufficient to produce a signal appropriate for injection into the oscilloscope may be used. Pulse receiver  may also be used for limiting its output\u2014the signal input to the oscilloscope, to for example, nominally one volt or 1.5 volt for input to the oscilloscope. This is done on a \u2018real time\u2019 basis, so that the limiting takes place only when the incident signal is present in the signal so that the backscatter signal (between the tone bursts) may be unaffected. This may be significant as the input to pulse receiver  may contain the original signal coming from the power amplifier  (e.g., on the order of tens of volts) as well as the smaller reflected signals from transducer . By limiting the larger signals at their output while amplifying the smaller signals containing the backscatter data, the dynamic range of the signal presented to oscilloscope  may be reduced significantly relative to what it may be in the absence of the limiting function. This may be important given the upper limits to input voltage to, and limited dynamic range, for example 8 bits of the A\/D conversion in oscilloscope .","Oscilloscope  and\/or processor  may be used for digitizing, analyzing and storing the signals received from pulse receiver . The analysis may be a calculation of a high resolution power spectrum of the signal containing the incident and backscattered signals with the built in FFT.","The signal processing requirements for the formation of the FFT may be, for example, sampling a 16 MHz signal, which may require a Nyquist sampling rate of at least 32 million samples\/sec. The FFT may provide adequate frequency resolution (\u201chigh resolution\u201d or \u201chigh precision\u201d power spectrum) to produce spectra with adequate detail to capture the spectral shape defined by the fluid flow in the sample. For example, a frequency resolution (the separation between frequency bins in the FFT) may be nominally 25 Hz, 1 Hz, 100 Hz or 200 Hz. Any frequency resolution may be used. The resolution in frequency may be measured by the bin width\u2014the separation in frequency between the successive frequency points. This bin width may be the reciprocal of the length of the signal analyzed. For example, to obtain such resolution, a time domain signal of length 1\/(25 Hz)=40 msec may be required. Thus, a typical digitized time domain signal consists of 40 msec of a signal sampled at, for example, 50 MSa\/sec, which is a time-domain signal consisting of two million points upon which the FFT is performed. This may require an oscilloscope with memory deep enough to store and operate millions of data points for each FFT. The frequency resolution may go down to 1 Hz, in such cases performing the FFT may take more time. In one embodiment, computation devices provide this degree of spectral resolution with adequate speed, with approximately a 1 second-long interrogating signal. Any other analytical methods other than FFT, such as mixers, narrow band filters and the like that provide adequately high-resolution power spectra may be used.","The high resolution power spectrum may enable the measurement of fluid velocity and particle size in sample  when the velocity is generated by streaming. For example, velocities of 1-10 cm\/sec correspond to Doppler shifts of 200-2000 Hz at 15 Mhz.","The interrogating signal may be included in the analyzed signal (without the need to gate it out) and may not require the use of special frequency filters to eliminate the non-backscattered signal parts of the spectrum. The latter may appear as the main peak in the analyzed power spectrum. Other embodiments may use time gating or frequency filters to avoid analyzing of the interrogating signal before performing the FFT. One embodiment of the invention may analyze backscatter from any part of the fluid in which it is created by placing the focal zone in the desired part of the fluid. No gating to separate the backscattered energy from that part of the fluid of interest may be required.","Oscilloscope  and\/or processor  may be also used for creating averages of many spectra. Each data point may be the result of the average over 250 individual spectra. The random appearance of very large and broad (in frequency) unphysical spectra, \u201cglitches\u201d or aberrations may interfere with averaging. While the origin of these artifacts has not been determined with certainty, these unphysical spectra have the appearance of spectral leakage associated with Fourier transforms of aperiodic time series. Hanning filters may be provided with oscilloscope  software and may be used to suppress spectral leakage. This may be related to the length or the dynamic range of the time series. These artifacts may be removed before the spectra are analyzed (e.g. before averages may be formed). Oscilloscope  may also monitor the shape of the spectra as they are computed and only store those that meet specified criteria (e.g, those that represent backscattered energy and contain information about the particles).","One embodiment of the present invention may self-calibrate by measuring the reflected signal from the back wall of the chamber, a target with constant properties. This may be required to assure that the signal generating electronics, e.g., signal generator , power amplifier  and transducer  (in both transmit and receive characteristics) and the signal reception and digitization components, e.g., pulse receiver  and oscilloscope  are working properly. This may be important when, for example, bubbles may be formed on the transducer lens or acoustic transmission properties of the fluid differ from those anticipated.","When transducer  is used on the side of the chamber its normal measurement position may be flush with the wall of the chamber, and since its focal length is smaller than the dimension of the chamber only relatively weak reflections may be seen from the walls. To obtain a strong wall reflection limited in time (e.g. one that may resemble the input tone bursts), transducer  may be slid across the chamber so that it may be a fixed distance from the back wall, placing the focal volume near the wall which may be a rigid structure with very high reflectivity. The resulting back wall reflections (\u201cBWR\u201d) may be quite large and fall midway in time between the interrogating tone bursts, as is illustrated in .","The BWR may be used as a self-test or may be used to calibrate the system. Such testing or calibration may be performed in for example the time domain or in the frequency domain. For relatively high concentrations, the back wall reflections may not agree with those for lower concentrations, due to the high attenuation or scattering when many particles are present. When this occurs, the BWR signal may be a measure of the attenuation due to the particles and a second measure of the suspension, this time of the forward scattering of the particles. Measuring both the backscatter and the forward scatter may provide more information about sample  than just backscatter.","Reference is made to  which shows a time trace of part of the BWR signal showing acoustic pressure vs. time representing main power bursts with the 10-20% smaller reflections from the back wall between them, according to an embodiment of the invention.","The BWR signal at the oscilloscope input may be, in voltage terms, about the same amplitude as the interrogating signal tone bursts. This signal may give a convenient visual reference for the BWR signal which may, for example, if there are no bubbles and the medium is not attenuating the signal, within about 10-20% of the level of the interrogating tone bursts. Usually, if the BWR signal is smaller than expected this fact may be noticed and corrective action may be taken. In the case of, for example, bubbles on the lens, the best approach may be to lower the level of the sample to below the lens and slowly refill chamber , stopping when the lens is about half wetted and proceeding very slowly afterward to completely cover the lens. Another solution may be to remove enough of sample  to allow removal of transducer  entirely from chamber  to remove any bubbles from the lens using, for example, a paper towel, and to clean the lens with, for example, an alcohol wipe or by flushing it with water.","The BWR signal may be measured before and after a set of spectra is taken. When there is additional reason for concern, such as, for example, when achieving the anticipated BWR signal was difficult before the start of a measurement, the BWR may be measured several times during data acquisition for a given sample.","Reference is made to  which shows a plot of the squares of the voltage of a BWR signal used to calculate BWR coefficients, according to an embodiment of the invention. A quantitative measurement of BWR may be obtained from a BWR time trace signal. This BWR coefficient may be obtained by isolating a portion of the BWR signal (e.g., 4,000 points representing about a dozen tone bursts and back wall reflections between), and summing the squares of the voltage at every point and separately adding the sums in the tone bursts and in the wall reflections to obtain measures of power in each. A plot of these squared time series is shown in , and a comparison of this BWR metric for a series of measurements is shown in .","In cases when the sample's acoustic properties vary from that of water, for example, in samples with very high concentrations there may be substantial attenuation of propagation of acoustic waves or if the sample has an acoustic impedance that differs significantly from that of water the acoustic pressure generated in the medium may differ from that in the chamber when the reference BWR signal was defined. In such cases, the deviation from the reference BWR coefficient may be a function of the concentration and this deviation then may provide a second and independent measurement of the concentration. Other ultrasonic concentration measurement methods may be based on such differences.","Reference is made to  which shows a BWR signal measured with perfluorocarbon particles in an emulsion to decrease with increasing concentration, according to an embodiment of the invention. The BWR is shown as a function of dilutions in a perfluorocarbon emulsion. The original undiluted sample (dilution of 1) has concentration 40% by volume. As the samples are diluted concentration may decrease and the BWR may increase until it reaches the level comparable to that found in water.","Attenuation may reduce the backscattered energy per unit concentration reaching the transducer and may cause a calibration curve to deviate from linear at higher concentrations. BWR signals may provide a measure of the attenuation which may be used to construct a normalization function to \u201ccorrect\u201d the concentration vs. reflected power curves and may allow construction of a linear calibration curve to concentrations above the regime in which the effects are small.","Development of a calibration curve representing backscattered power vs. concentration may require precise knowledge of the concentration of measured samples. In one embodiment of the invention establishment of the concentration of a sample may be done by removing the entire sample from the measurement chamber after acoustic measurements are made and then to determine its concentration by independent means. For biological samples, for example, this may entailed lysing the cellular materials and counting nuclei in the Guava cell counting apparatus. This may eliminate any uncertainties due to for example pipeting.","Reference is made to ,  and  which show the high resolution power spectra of the backscattered signal which is a basic unit of data, according to an embodiment of the invention.

For example, the main peak may be assigned to bins 100-113 and may be summed over the entire remaining bins (i.e. n=1, n=99, n=114 and n=212). These power sums may be on the order of several hundred to several thousand nanowatts.","The same sums may be computed for background spectra (e.g., with no particles present or with the stirring turned off so that the particles fall to the bottom of the measurement vessel) and the power so obtained may be subtracted from the power with particles to form concentration calibration curves that approach zero for concentrations approaching zero.","There may be a wide variability in these spectra for a given sample. Some may be very close to the background, and may be indicative of little backscatter during the analysis time window, and others may show much higher backscatter and definite structural shape in the spectra. There may be also a large range in the associated power. The statistics of this variation may be driven by the variation in the number of scatterers that contribute to the power in a particular spectrum. The power may tend to follow a log normal distribution.","A spectrum may include a very large feature such as for example a large peak to the left of the main peak which may indicate scattering from a large object moving away from the transducer. This may indicate, for example, the presence of clumps of sample material or a foreign object or air bubble in the sample or the like. Appearance of several spectra of this type may require further study of the sample.","As described above, about, for example, 10% of the calculated spectra may not have this character. These may have very wide main peaks, and the general levels may be one or more orders of magnitude larger than the majority of the spectra. Such spectra may be artifacts, most likely the result of spectral leakage due to, for example, a failure of the Hanning filter used to condition the very long time records for the FFT. Identifying these electronic \u201cglitches\u201d may be done by using a main peak width criterion. Any other method of identifying may be used. This may identify spectra with main peaks that may be broader than about, for example, ten frequency bins when plotted with, for example, an ordinate of 0.0001 mw as unphysical. Almost all \u201cglitch\u201d spectra may fail this test by a wide margin and may be eliminated from analysis. However, there may be a small number of spectra that may not readily be assigned to either the data or glitch category and because these may tend to contain power that is relatively high with respect to the rest of the data, for example, two or more may affect a measurement by a few percent.","It has been found with one embodiment and one set of data that no artifacts or \u201cglitches\u201d occur for operations at 20 MHz with the existing electronics which is a strong indication that these are indeed artifacts arising in the signal processing.","After the FFT's are taken and stored in the oscilloscope they may be imported to a mathematical tool, for example, an Excel\u2122 file or other suitable mathematical processor and the indicated power calculations may be performed for each spectrum.

Each point on this curve may represent the mean of the backscattered power for all the spectra to its left. The final value may be the average over the entire set of spectra and may be the final reflectivity value for this measurement. The slope of this cumulative mean curve may be a measure of the stability of the measurement. If the measurement represents a steady state condition with a converging mean this curve may be flat; that is, there may be no change with increasing numbers of spectra. The cumulative mean may show large jumps as it incorporates higher-power spectra, especially toward the beginning of run where there are fewer spectra included in the average. Very large jumps may indicate non-physical data.","When high energy spectra that may be difficult to assign to either artifact or \u201creal data\u201d status may occur, their effect on the cumulative mean may be estimated by calculating it with and without them. This may be a measure of the precision of a measurement. In another embodiment automated criteria may be used to sort the spectra in terms of the total measured backscattered power to eliminate operator bias. In this embodiment, the spectral power assigned to a measurement may be the average power for, for example, the lowest 200 of 250 spectra. Other embodiments may be designed with electronics and signal processing that may eliminate these glitches.","For each data point an average spectrum may be computed by, for example, taking the bin by bin average for all spectra included in the analysis for that measurement point.

This may not require physical contact with the suspension. For example, the transducer may be inserted into a test chamber which may include the sample, e.g., test chamber  of , from the top, bottom or side through for example a hole or other opening. It may be situated outside a test chamber with adequately acoustically transparent walls. The transducer, for example, transducer  of  may have a resonant flat piezoelectric ceramic crystal and a concave elastomeric focusing lens. Other suitable transducers may be used, for example, transducers with shaped piezoelectric elements to provide the focusing function. The transducer may have different diameters and focal lengths, such as for example, 4 mm and focal lengths of 1.6 mm, and an outer diameter of 6 mm and focal lengths of 7 mm. For example, the focal length of the transducer may be on the order of 1.6 mm and the focal volume or focal zone in the vicinity of the focus may be a fraction of a cubic millimeter. Any other suitable transducers with any diameters and focal lengths may be used. Any suitable numbers of transducer may be used, for example, for generating more than one signal, or to transmit a signal with one transducer and to receive the backscattered signal with another transducer.","In block  an ultrasonic signal may be directed from a transducer towards the particles in the suspension. The ultrasonic signal may be focused to a focal zone in the suspension. The signal may for example include a series of tone bursts, for example, of equal length at the selected center frequency. For example, frequencies between 7 and 20 MHz and tone burst lengths from 20 to 200 cycles may be used. Other frequency ranges and tone burst lengths may be used. In one embodiment the string of tone bursts of a single frequency may be long, for example, tens of milliseconds and the tone bursts may be tens of cycles long, thus each burst may be several microseconds long, these may be repeated every few microseconds. For example, a signal of 40 millisecond long consisting of a string of 20 cycle-long (1.3 microseconds) tone bursts of a single frequency, of 15 Mhz may be repeated every 7 microseconds. The tone burst may include 20-100 cycles. In the period in between bursts, the interrogating signal may be turned off.","In block  the fluid of suspension may be subjected to acoustic streaming or otherwise placed in motion, which may give rise to velocities of particles in suspension which may also stir the fluid. The ultrasonic interrogating signal may be used to induce streaming of the particles near the focal zone. The streaming may be generated by the radiation pressure of the acoustic energy of the transmitted signal on the fluid of the suspension. It may be enhanced by the high levels of acoustic energy in the focal volume due to the large acoustic field there which may be produced by for example focusing and the use of narrow band interrogating signals. In some embodiments of the invention streaming may allow Doppler effect mediated measurements of particle velocities without any other source of velocity.","According to one embodiment of the invention when streaming is used as a source of velocity or movement the resulting spectra may show peaks on the order of a few bins wide, for example, about 10, representing 250 Hz range of frequencies or about a 1 cm\/sec range of velocities. These may indicate particle motions at the velocity corresponding to the Doppler shift associated with the frequency difference between these peaks and the main peak which represents the interrogating signal.","In block  a return signal backscattered from the particles in the suspension may be received. The returning signal may be received during the intervals between the tone bursts of the directed or transmitted ultrasonic signal and may include frequencies that may differ from that of the transmitted ultrasonic signal. In the period in between bursts, when the interrogating signal may be turned off backscattered signals may return from the focal zone, e.g., the returning signal may be received during the intervals between the tone bursts of the transmitted interrogating ultrasonic signal. The returned, backscattered signal may fall between the tone bursts, where the signal is turned off. The received signal may include of the original signal with the backscattered signals, of power received from particles, falling between the interrogating signals.","In block  the return signal may be processed to obtain properties of the particles, such as velocity, concentration and size of the particles. The analyzing and processing of the received signal may include a calculation of a high resolution power spectrum of the signal containing the incident and reflected signals.","The processing of the return signal may include obtaining the power spectrum of the returning signal by applying a FFT and\/or by applying a narrow band filter. The signal processing requirements for the formation of the FFT may be, for example, sampling a 16 MHz signal, which may require a Nyquist sampling rate of at least 32 million samples\/sec. The FFT may have adequate frequency resolution to produce spectra with adequate detail to capture the spectral shape defined by the fluid flow in the sample.","The processing of the returning signal may include separating a reflected signal from a back wall surrounding the suspension  in the time domain. One embodiment of the present invention may self-calibrate by measuring the reflected signal from the back wall of the chamber, a target with constant properties.","The BWR may fall midway in time between the tone bursts of the signal. The BWR may be used as a self-test or may be used to calibrate the system. Such testing or calibration may be performed in for example the time domain or in the frequency domain.","In block  particle properties may be obtained and\/or output, for example on a monitor of a PC or workstation. The reflected processed spectra of the reflected signal may provide information about the nature of the particles. For example, multiple spectra peaks may imply the existence of more than one type of particle and the velocities with which these particles move may provide information about them and the viscosity of the suspensions.","Backscatter from the suspension may occur in a band of Doppler-shifted frequencies, due in part to the distribution of particle velocities (or more precisely of the components of these velocities in the direction of the line between the scatterer and the transducer). The shape of the reflectivity spectrum (e.g. backscattered power vs. frequency) may contain additional information about the particles. For example, the maximum velocity that can be induced by a given level of stirring or acoustical streaming depends on the viscosity of a sample likewise, under the influence of streaming alone, particles of different size may attain different velocities depending on possible particle interactions with the high acoustic fields or differing drag coefficients. In such cases, the reflection spectrum may include multiple peaks corresponding to the particle sizes.","The methods of this invention are useful in determining molecular size of a particular material. In one embodiment, the methods are useful in determining size of the material which is non-uniform in terms of its density, compressibility, etc. In some embodiments, the methods are useful in determining parameters for materials of different sizes within a single suspension. In some embodiments, the particles\/molecules have a diameter ranging from 1-10,000 nanometers.

In one embodiment, the term \u201csubtraction\u201d refers to any means of discounting particular values obtained, without necessarily involving physical removal of the values from an equation, for example, a spectra that is visibly irrelevant is discounted or thereby subtracted.","In one embodiment, the term \u201chigh resolution\u201d in connection with the methods of this invention is to be understood to refer to high precision, and vice versa, e.g., a power spectrum with very narrow frequency bin widths.","Embodiments of the invention include the use of ultrasonic backscatter to characterize a desired parameter, for example, concentration, particle size, viscosity of suspension, etc., for example, in samples containing islets, cells, nanoparticles and the like. Some embodiments may use of an interrogating signal to produce velocities and Doppler shifts by Eckart streaming, and generate high resolution, very narrow bin width backscatter power spectra which may allow determination of detailed spectral shape of backscatter which makes possible measurement of, for example, concentration by adding up the power in the spectra away from the main peak, particle size by measuring the velocities generated by Eckart streaming with other velocity generating means not working. Other measurement may be done.","Embodiments of the invention may use BWR to calibrate the system, and also may combine focused transducer with narrowband signals to produce high power in small volumes and narrow frequency ranges. This may allow generation of large Doppler shifted signals within a few hundred hertz of the main peak due to the interrogating signals, regardless of the source of velocity. This combination may also create streaming and velocity.","It is to be understood that any material which may be used according to the methods of this invention is to be considered within the scope of this invention.","It will be appreciated by persons skilled in the art that the present invention is not limited by what has been particularly shown and described hereinabove.
