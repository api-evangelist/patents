{"@attributes":{"id":"description"},"BRFSUM":[{},{}],"heading":["FIELD OF THE INVENTION","BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION","SUMMARY OF THE INVENTION","DETAILED DESCRIPTION OF THE PREFERRED EMBODIMENTS"],"p":["This invention relates in general to the field of television systems, and more particularly, to the field of interactive television.","With the recent advent of digital transmission technology, subscriber network television systems are now capable of providing many other services in addition to traditional analog broadcast video. For example, two-way and advanced one-way communications between a subscriber and a subscriber network system headend are now possible. The home communication terminal (\u201cHCT\u201d), also known as the set-top box, has become an important computing device for accessing video services and navigating a subscriber through a maze of services available. In addition to supporting traditional analog broadcast video and functionality, digital HCTs (or \u201cDHCTs\u201d) now also support an increasing number of enhanced video services that are made available through digital transmission technology.","Interactive television is an enhanced video technology enabled by two-way communication between a subscriber and a subscriber network system headend that is made possible by digital transmission technology and consists of such enhanced services as video-on-demand (\u201cVOD\u201d). In the digital transmission infrastructure that is utilized for interactive television, VOD service requires the exclusive or substantially exclusive use of bandwidth capacity, and thus, a portion of the infrastructure serves as the VOD infrastructure. Multiple System Operators (\u201cMSOs\u201d) invest millions of dollars in the construction and maintenance of VOD infrastructures to insure that there is sufficient bandwidth capacity available for VOD service. Thus, there is a need to efficiently utilize the VOD infrastructure to generate revenue.","There are other electronic communications systems that have been used for the sale and delivery of audio, video, and other products that can be transmitted electronically. For example, one may be able to purchase an audio product on the Internet and then download it to a personal computer for future use. The application of electronic communications systems for the sale and delivery of applicable products can offer advantages over more conventional product sales and delivery systems such as phone ordering with parcel delivery. For example, advantages may be offered such as the lower cost of product delivery or the savings of not requiring inventory, floor space, and retail employees. But, the present electronic communications sales and delivery systems comprise restraints in transferring information. Thus, there is a need for flexibility in electronic communications systems.","The preferred embodiment of the present invention may be viewed as, among other things, a recordable media content purchasing system comprising a memory, and a processor configured with the memory to download recordable media content at one of a plurality of various download times for purchase of the recordable media content.","Other advantages of the present invention will become apparent to one with skill in the art upon examination of the following drawings and detailed description.","The preferred embodiments of the invention now will be described more fully hereinafter with reference to the accompanying drawings, in which preferred embodiments of the invention are shown. This invention may, however, be embodied in many different forms and should not be construed as limited to the embodiments set forth herein; rather, these embodiments are provided so that this disclosure will be thorough and complete, and will fully convey the scope of the invention to those having ordinary skill in the art. Furthermore, all \u201cexamples\u201d given herein are intended to be non-limiting.","One preferred embodiment of the present invention is generally implemented as part of a subscriber network television system, such as for a non-limiting example, a digital broadband delivery system (DBDS) or a cable television system (CTS). Hence, an illustrative DBDS and its operation will be described initially. Other conventional data delivery systems are also included within the scope of the present invention.  shows a block diagram view of a DBDS , which is generally a high quality, reliable and integrated network system that is preferably capable of delivering video, audio, voice and data services to client devices, such as a digital home communication terminal devices (DHCTs) . Although  depicts a high level view of a DBDS , it should be appreciated that a plurality of DBDS systems can tie together a plurality of regional networks into an integrated global network so that DHCT users can receive media content provided from anywhere in the world.","The DBDS  preferably delivers broadcast video signals as digitally formatted signals in addition to delivering traditional broadcast analog video signals. Furthermore, the system can preferably support one way broadcast services as well as both one-way data services and two-way media and data services. The two-way operation of the network preferably allows for user interactivity with services, such as Pay-Per-View programming, Near Video-On-Demand (NVOD) programming according to any of several known NVOD implementation methods, View-on-Demand (VOD) programming (according to any of several VOD implementation methods), and interactive applications, such as Internet connections.","The DBDS  also provides the interfaces, network control, transport control, session control, and servers to access media content from media services, and distributes media content to DHCT users. Note that the term media content will be understood to mean the content stored and delivered throughout the DBDS , such as movies, software, music, etc. When it is helpful to discuss each individual movie or program, etc. (i.e. media content in the singular), the term media content instance or the like will be used. The title of that media content instance will be referred to as a media content title. As shown in , a typical DBDS  comprises a head end , hubs , an HFC access network , and DHCTs . It should be appreciated that although a single component (e.g. a head end) is illustrated in , a DBDS  can feature a plurality of any one of the illustrated components or may be configured with alternative embodiments for any one of the individual components or with yet other additional components not enumerated above. Media content provided by one or more content providers, such as content provider , is communicated by the content providers to one or more head ends . From those head ends  the content is then communicated over a communications network  that includes a plurality of HFC access networks  (only one HFC access network  is illustrated). The HFC access network  preferably comprises a plurality of HFC nodes , each of which may serve a local geographical area. The hub  connects to the HFC node  through a fiber portion of the HFC access network . The HFC node  is connected to a tap  which, in one implementation, is connected to a digital home communication terminal (DHCT) . In other implementations, the tap  is connected to a network interface unit (NIU)  which is connected to a digital home communication terminal (DHCT) . The NIU  is normally located at the property of a user and provides a transparent interface between the HFC node  and the users' internal wiring. Coaxial cables are typically used to couple nodes , taps  and NIUs  because the electrical signals can be easily repeated with radio frequency (RF) amplifiers. As the high-level operations of many of the functions of a DBDS  are well known to those of skill in the art, further high level description of the overall DBDS  of  will not be contained herein. It will be appreciated, however, that the DBDS  shown in  is merely illustrative and should not be construed as implying any limitations upon the scope of the embodiments of the invention. For instance, subscriber network television systems also included within the scope of the embodiments of the invention include systems not utilizing physical structured cabling for transmission, such as, but not limited to, satellite systems. Further, transmission media included within the scope of the embodiments of the invention include, but are not limited to, HFC, optical, satellite, RF, FM, and microwave. Further, data provided from the head end  to the DHCTs  and programming necessary to perform the functions discussed below will be understood to be present in the DBDS , in accordance with the description below.",{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0044","num":"0043"},"figref":["FIG. 2","FIG. 1","FIG. 2"],"b":["10","11","16","16","11","16","11","16"]},"Referring again to , the downstream direction channels, having been multiplexed preferably using frequency division multiplexing (FDM), and often referred to as in band channels, include Analog Transmission Channels (ATCs)  and Digital Transmission Channels (DTCs) .","These channels carry video, audio, and data services. For example, these channels can carry television signals, Internet data, or any additional types of data, such as Electronic Program Guide (EPG) data. The signals and data carried on these channels are provided through software, collectively referred to herein as services, as further defined below. The ATCs  are typically broadcast in 6 MHz channels having an analog broadcast composed of analog video and analog audio, and include Broadcast TV Systems Committee (BTSC) stereo and Secondary Audio Program (SAP) audio.","Like the ATCs , the DTCs  each occupy 6 MHz of the RF spectrum. However, the DTCs  are preferably digital channels consisting of 64- or 256-Quadrature Amplitude Modulated (QAM) digital signals formatted as MPEG-2 transport streams, allocated in a separate frequency range. The MPEG-2 transport stream enables transmission of a plurality of DTC channel types over each 6 MHz RF channel, as compared to a 6 MHz ATC . Three types of digital transport channels  illustrated in  include broadcast digital transmission channels , carousel digital transmission channels , and on-demand transmission channels . MPEG-2 transport may be used to multiplex video, audio, and data in each of these digital transmission channels (DTCs) . However, because MPEG-2 transport streams multiplex video, audio, and data to be placed in the same stream, the DTCs  do not necessarily have to be allocated in separate 6 MHz RF frequencies, unlike the ATCs .","Continuing with , the broadcast DTCs  and carousel DTCs  preferably function as continuous feeds for indefinite time, whereas the on demand DTCs  are continuous feed sessions for a limited time. Preferably, all DTCs  are capable of being transmitted at high data rates. The broadcast DTCs  preferably carry data comprising multiple digitally compressed and formatted as MPEG-2, TV channels and other continuously fed data information. The carousel DTCs  carry broadcast data, such as EPG data and data for a catalog of recordable media content, that is systematically broadcast in a cycling fashion but updated and revised as need be. Thus, the carousel DTCs  can serve to carry high volume data, such as EPG data and purchasable recordable media (PRM) catalog data, as well as other data at high data rates. The carousel DTCs  preferably carry data formatted in directories and files by a Broadcast File System (BFS), which is used for producing and transmitting data streams throughout the subscriber network television system, and which provides an efficient method for delivery of application executables and application data to the DHCT . The on demand DTCs  can carry particular information, such as compressed video and audio pertaining to subscriber requested video services or recordable media content, as well as other specialized data information. Each carousel DTC  and on demand DTC  is defined by a session managed by a session manager  in , via an MPEG-2 Digital Storage Media\u2014Command and Control (DSM-CC) protocol.","Also shown in  is an Out-Of-Band (OOB) channel  that provides a continuously available two-way signaling path to the DHCT  regardless of which in-band channels are tuned to by an individual DHCT  in-band tuner. The DHCT  may also comprise multiple in-band tuners in which case the OOB channel  complements the service of the set of in-band tuners. The OOB channel  consists of a forward data channel (FDC) and a reverse data channel (RDC). The OOB channel  can comply to any one of a number of well known transport protocols but preferably complies to either a DAVIC 1.1 Transport Protocol with FDC of 1.544 MBps or more using Quadrature Phase-Shift Keying (QPSK) modulation and an RDC of 1.544 Mbps or more using QPSK modulation, or to a DOCSIS Transport Protocol with FDC of 27 Mbps using 64-QAM modulation and a RDC of 1.544 Mbps or more using QPSK modulation or 16-QAM modulation. The OOB channel  provides the two-way operation of the network, which allows a subscriber interactivity with the services provided by the network. Therefore, the DHCT  preferably contains functionality similar to a networked computer (i.e., a computer without a persistent storage device) in addition to traditional set top box functionality, as is well known in the art. Furthermore, the OOB channel  is not limited to a 6 MHz spectrum, but generally to a smaller spectrum, such as 1.5 or 3 MHz, in one embodiment.",{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0050","num":"0049"},"figref":["FIG. 3","FIG. 1","FIG. 2","FIG. 4","FIG. 4","FIG. 4","FIG. 4"],"b":["11","11","11","319","323","332","319","477","477","477","477","444","16","441","322"]},"The DNCS  provides management, monitoring, and control of the DBDS  () network elements and broadcast services provided to users. The DNCS  provides control and communication functionality by monitoring the DHCTs  and facilitating messaging between the DHCTs  and components within the headend . When any of the communication functionality is provided by headend  components other than the DNCS , the DNCS  indirectly provides similar functionality by providing the control and coordination to those other devices that provide the required communication functionality to enact a particular media service.","In one implementation, the DNCS  includes functional support for client-server applications and other components in the DBDS  () with its server counterparts, including BFS Server  and SAM server , which will be described in greater detail below. Briefly, the client-server application counterparts work in coordination with DNCS  to effectively utilize the primary features of the interactive television system and manage the sale and delivery of audio, video, software, and other media content. Furthermore, the client-server application software in communication with DNCS  can effectively redirect allocation of excess VOD infrastructure capacity to facilitate maximum rate delivery of (PRM) content and also manages impulse purchase and trial purchase transactions, in cooperation with the PRM application client  (). Also, in one implementation, the DNCS  uses a data insertion multiplexor  and a data QAM  to insert the in-band broadcast file system (BFS) data into a compressed data stream, for example, an MPEG-2 transport stream.","The DNCS  includes a session manager  and a conditional access system . The session manager  preferably uses the MPEG-2 DSM-CC protocol to coordinate requests for media content, for example, PRM content. The session manager  processes user to network (U-N) session signaling messages, manages allocation of session-related network resources and supports network management operations. The session manager  supports exclusive services, such as the PRM service, by providing the signaling interface to establish, maintain, and release client initiated exclusive sessions. The session manager  acts as a point of contact to the network for the DHCT  in the network  to establish individual sessions. The session manager  also defines a resource descriptor structure, which is used to request the network resources within a session.","The conditional access system  communicates with the DHCT  and the billing system  to determine whether a particular subscriber is authorized to receive PRM content. If a DHCT  is not authorized for PRM service, the conditional access system  insures that such services are not transmitted.","The PRM application server  communicates via the Ethernet connection  to a service application manager (SAM) server  contained on the DNCS . Service application manager (SAM) server  is a server component of a client-server pair of components, with the client component being located at the DHCT . Together, the client-server SAM components provide a system in which the user can access services, which are identified by an application to run and one or more parameters, such as particular data content, specific to that service. The SAM server  also manages the life cycle of the applications on the system, including the definition, activation, and suspension of services they provide and the downloading of the applications into the DHCT  as necessary. The PRM application server  defines its application to the SAM server  and the SAM server  instructs the BFS server  to add the executable code for the PRM application client  () to a carousel (not shown) for distribution to the various DHCTs  in the network . In other embodiments, executable code is not transferred, but instead, functionality is effected through other mechanisms.","The BFS server  is a part of a broadcast file system that has a BFS client  () in each DHCT  in the network . Applications on both the headend  and the DHCT  can access the data stored in the BFS server  in a similar manner to a file system found on disc operating systems. The BFS server  loads data for applications on a carousel (not shown) that sends data in a cyclical repeated fashion, each cycle approximately the same period of time so that the DHCT  that communicates a request for any particular data may receive it when the user desires the data. Thus, the BFS client  () contained in the DHCT  that receives the broadcast from the BFS server  can implement the application for the user, as will be described in greater detail below.","PRM content or data can reside in the PRM application server , in the VOD content server , or in other application servers (not shown). The content manager  and VOD content servers  deliver MPEG-2 content to a group of QAM modulators . PRM content can reside in VOD content servers  as a movie, as an audio program, or as an MPEG-2 private data program. The content manager  is responsible for managing the content on the VOD content servers  and on other servers such as PRM application server  or other application servers (not shown). The PRM application server  utilizes the content manager  and VOD content servers  to deliver the data, video and\/or audio streams that make up the PRM services. The PRM application server  is also responsible for controlling the content manager  and VOD content servers . The QAM group  is actually a multiplex of QAMs that support PRM content transmission to a particular DHCT . The session manager  in DNCS  determines which QAM modulator has access to a particular DHCT . The QAM modulators  are also responsible for encrypting the transport stream and inserting other data and information into the stream, as will be described in more detail below. The QAM modulators  receive the MPEG-2 transport stream from the VOD content servers  and convert it to an encrypted RF signal at a specified frequency (channel).","In one embodiment of the invention, content manager  fulfills management of VOD content and PRM content. In an alternate embodiment, content manager  is comprised of two entities, a first content manager dedicated to VOD content management and a second manager dedicated to PRM content management.","A Quadrature Phase-Shift Keying (QPSK) modem  is responsible for transporting the out-of-band IP (Internet protocol) datagram traffic between the distribution headend  and a DHCT . Data from the QPSK modem  is routed by headend router  within the headend . The headend router  is also responsible for delivering upstream application traffic, such as user requests for PRM content, to the various application servers, such as, for example, PRM application server .",{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0060","num":"0059"},"figref":["FIG. 4","FIG. 4"],"b":["16","11","441","16","16","477","11","16","16","442","11","18","11","18"]},"The DHCT  preferably includes at least one processor  for controlling operations of the DHCT , an output system  for driving the television display , and at least one tuner system  for tuning into a particular television channel to be displayed and for sending and receiving various types of data or media content to and from the headend . The tuner system  includes, in one implementation, an out-of-band tuner and upstream transmitter for bi-directional QPSK data communication and a quadrature amplitude modulation (QAM) tuner (in-band) for receiving television signals. It should be appreciated that the OOB tuner and upstream transmitter can be one component, or in other embodiments, the tuner and transmitter can be independent of each other and located separately within the DHCT . The OOB tuner and upstream transmitter enables the DHCT  to interface with a subscriber network television system so that the DHCT  can provide upstream data to the network, for example, via a QPSK channel that serves as an upstream OOB channel and received by a QPSK receiver in QPSK modem  in headend . In this manner, a subscriber can interact with the subscriber network television system to request services or the data of services such as, for example, PRM content. Alternatively, the upstream data transmission can be effected via a QAM channel with a QAM transmitter in DHCT  and a QAM receiver in headend . Alternatively, a telephone modem in the DHCT  can be utilized for upstream data transmission. Further, a headend  or hub  or other component located upstream in the subscriber network television system may receive data from a telephone network coupled to a telephone modem and can route the upstream data to a destination internal or external to the subscriber network television system.","The DHCT  preferably includes a demultiplexing system  comprising functionality for QAM demodulation, forward error correction (FEC), transport demultiplexing, decryption (via decryptor ), and parsing, as is well known in the art, to counter the effect of signal processing of broadcast media content and data in the subscriber network television system. Transport demultiplexing preferably includes MPEG-2 transport demultiplexing. The demultiplexing system  in communication with communication interface , tuner system  and processor  effects reception of compressed video streams, compressed audio streams, and compressed data streams corresponding to a selected program to be separated from other programs and\/or streams transported in the tuned transmission channel and to be eventually stored in secondary storage device  () in accordance with one embodiment of the invention, as will be described in greater detail below.","Additionally, a receiver  receives externally generated information, such as user inputs or commands from other devices. The DHCT  may also include one or more wireless or wired interfaces, also called communication ports  and , for receiving and\/or transmitting data to other devices. For example, the DHCT  may feature USB (Universal Serial Bus), Ethernet (for connection to a computer), IEEE-1394 (for connection to media devices in an entertainment center), serial, and\/or parallel ports. The user inputs may be, for example, provided by a computer or transmitter with buttons or keys located either on the exterior of the terminal or by a hand-held remote control device or keyboard that includes user-actuated buttons, or the user inputs may be aural.","In one implementation, the DHCT  includes system memory , which includes FLASH memory  and dynamic random access memory (DRAM) , for storing various applications, modules and data for execution and use by the processor . Basic functionality of the DHCT  is provided by an operating system  that is primarily stored in FLASH memory . Among other elements, the operating system  includes at least one resource manager  that provides an interface to resources of the DHCT  such as, for example, computing resources. An application referred to as a navigator  is also resident in FLASH memory  for providing a navigation framework for services provided by the DHCT . The navigator  registers for and in some cases reserves certain user inputs related to navigational keys such as channel increment\/decrement, last channel, favorite channel, etc. The navigator  also provides users with television related menu options that correspond to DHCT  functions such as, for example, blocking a channel or a group of channels from being displayed in a channel menu.","The FLASH memory  also contains a platform library . The platform library  is a collection of utilities useful to applications, such as a timer manager, a compression manager, a configuration manager, an HTML parser, a database manager, a widget toolkit, a string manager, and other utilities (not shown). These utilities are accessed by applications via application programming interfaces (APIs) as necessary so that each application does not have to contain these utilities. Two components of the platform library  that are shown in  are a window manager  and a service application manager client (SAM) .","The window manager  provides a mechanism for implementing the sharing of the screen regions and user input. The window manager  in the DHCT  is responsible for, as directed by one or more applications, implementing the creation, display, and de-allocation of the limited DHCT  screen display resources. It allows multiple applications to share the screen by assigning ownership of screen regions, or windows. The window manager  also maintains, among other things, a user input registry  in DRAM . When a user enters a key or a command via the remote control device  or another input device such as a keyboard or mouse, the user input registry  is accessed to determine which of various applications running on the DHCT  should receive data corresponding to the input key and in which order. As an application is executed, it registers a request to receive certain user input keys or commands. When the user presses a key corresponding to one of the commands on the remote control device , the command is received by the receiver  and relayed to the processor . The processor  dispatches the event to the operating system  where it is forwarded to the window manager  which ultimately accesses the user input registry  and routes data corresponding to the incoming command to the appropriate application.","The Client SAM  is a client component of a client-server pair of components, with the server component being located on the headend  preferably in DNCS . A SAM database  (i.e. structured data such as a database or data structure) in DRAM  includes a data structure of services and a data structure of channels that are created and updated by the headend . Herein, database will refer to a database, structured data or other data structures as is well known to those of ordinary skill in the art. Many services can be defined using the same application component, with different parameters. Examples of services include, without limitation and in accordance with one implementation, presenting television programs (available through a WatchTV application ), pay-per-view events (available through a PPV application ), digital music (), video-on-demand (available through an VOD application ), purchasable recordable media (PRM) services (via PRM application client ), and an interactive program guide (available through IPG application ). In general, the identification of a service includes the identification of an executable application that provides the service along with a set of application-dependent parameters that indicate to the application the service to be provided. For example, a service of presenting a television program could be executed by WatchTV application  with a set of parameters specifying the HBO to view HBO or with a separate set of parameters to view CNN. Each association of the application component (tune video) and one parameter component (HBO or CNN) represents a particular service that has a unique service I.D. The Client SAM  also interfaces with the resource manager , as discussed below, to control resources of the DHCT .","The PRM client application  preferably is downloaded into DRAM  from the head end . Alternatively, the PRM client application  may be resident in FLASH memory . Similar to an EPG application (not shown) that has an EPG database of records in which program information is supported by client-server EPG counterparts, the PRM client application  employs a first PRM database  of records that comprises information pertaining to PRM content for presentation to a subscriber. The first PRM database  contains sufficient information for the presentation of available PRM content at the current time and for subsequent periods. The PRM application server , in communication with PRM application client , effects updates to the first PRM database  stored in memory  or in a storage device (such as storage device ) of DHCT . PRM application client  reads first PRM database  records and processes them into a displayable representation as part of a GUI presentation displayed on a television  or similar display device for presentation to a subscriber.","PRM content information associated with PRM content is transmitted on a regular or periodic basis from PRM application server  () to one or more DHCTs . PRM content information may comprise descriptive information to populate the entries of a PRM guide, a service guide, or an EPG presentation with the corresponding PRM fields that are presented to the subscriber via a Graphical-User-Interface (GUI) from which a subscriber can select and request additional descriptive information about respective PRM content. Hence, per PRM content in the displayed presentation to the subscriber, the subscriber can retrieve and view (and hear if applicable) information specific to a PRM content title and proceed to purchase specific PRM content (i.e. one or more PRM content instances), as will be described in greater detail below. PRM content information comprises data organized into records of the first PRM database  with record fields containing, but not limited to, information such as PRM content title, PRM content description, PRM genre, release year, casts or performers list, ratings information, and play duration for each PRM content instance.","Application clients can also be downloaded into DRAM  at the request of the Client SAM , preferably in response to a request by the user or in response to a message from the headend . In one implementation, DRAM  contains a video-on-demand application (VOD) , an e-mail application , a PRM application , and a web browser application , among others. It should be clear to one with ordinary skill in the art that these applications are not limiting and merely serve as examples for one embodiment of the invention. Furthermore, one or more DRAM based applications may, as an alternative embodiment, be resident in FLASH memory . These applications, and others provided by the subscriber network television system operator, are top level software entities on the network for providing services to the user.","In one implementation, applications executing on the DHCT  work with the navigator  by abiding by several guidelines. First, an application utilizes the Client SAM  for the provision, activation, and suspension of services. Second, an application shares DHCT  resources with other applications and abides by the resource management policies of the Client SAM , the operating system , and the DHCT . Third, an application handles situations where resources are only available with navigator  intervention. Fourth, when an application loses service authorization while providing a service, the application suspends the service via the SAM (the navigator  will reactivate an individual service application when it later becomes authorized). Finally, an application client is designed to not have access to certain user input keys reserved by the navigator (i.e., power, channel +\/\u2212, volume +\/\u2212, etc.).","An executable program or algorithm corresponding to an operating system (OS) component, or to a client platform component, or to a client application, or to respective parts thereof, can reside in and execute out of DRAM  and\/or FLASH memory . Likewise, data input into or output from any executable program can reside in DRAM  or FLASH memory . Furthermore, an executable program or algorithm corresponding to an OS component, or to a client platform component, or to a client application, or to respective parts thereof, can reside in FLASH memory , or in a local storage device coupled to DHCT  and can be transferred into DRAM  for execution. Likewise, data input for an executable program can reside in FLASH memory  or a storage device, for example storage device , and can be transferred into DRAM  for use by an executable program or algorithm. In addition, data output by an executable program can be written into DRAM  by an executable program or algorithm and can be transferred into FLASH memory  or into a storage device for storage purposes.","The security processor  is a secure element for performing security and conditional access related functions. More particularly, the security processor  functions to authorize the DHCT  of a paying subscriber to execute specialized functionality of the DHCT , such as receiving and decrypting (or descrambling) encrypted (or scrambled) media content and other data sent from a remote device. Security processor  preferably includes a microprocessor and a memory that only the microprocessor of the security processor  may access. Preferably, security processor  is contained in a tamper proof package. With reference to , in one implementation, encryption is applied to the data stream of the requested media content, for example the respective PRM content, at the QAM group  at the headend  according to encryption methods well-known to those of ordinary skill in the art. An encryption component resident in the QAM group  in the head end  and under the direction of the DNCS  encrypts, for example, MPEG-2 transport stream packets used to transmit the PRM content. The encrypted PRM content also includes, in one embodiment, entitlement control messages that are recognized by the security processor  () at the DHCT  as information needed to decrypt the encrypted PRM content. Security processor  preferably stores authorization information, wherein the authorization information indicates that the subscriber is entitled to access the PRM content. The authorization information is obtained from one or more entitlement messages sent by the head end  after, or concurrently with, initialization of the DHCT  into a purchased service. If the authorization information indicates that the subscriber is entitled to the PRM content, security processor  generates a code word or key based on the authorization information and the received entitlement control message, and the security processor  uses this key to decrypt the encrypted PRM content at the decryptor  ().","In one embodiment, the DHCT  includes a primary storage device  and a secondary storage device . The ability to record programming on the primary storage device  provides a convenient method to temporarily buffer programming to fit a viewing schedule, however, in accordance with one embodiment, for economic reasons the systems will have a limited amount of primary storage. In one implementation, based on, for example, existing VCR usage patterns, there will be many occasions when the user will want to save or archive programs on the secondary storage device  for later viewing or archive the programs for later reference. The primary storage device  is preferably internal to DHCT  and in electrical communication to an internal main bus for communication with other DHCT  elements through a data interface  such as a SCSI or IDE interface. In other embodiments, the primary storage device  can be externally connected to (and thus removable from) the DHCT  via a communication port (for example,  or ) such as IEEE-1394 or USB or via a SCSI or an IDE interface. The primary storage device  is preferably a hard disk drive. The primary storage device  exhibits fast seek-time and high data transfer rate properties and its storage medium is preferably non-removable, such as in the case of a hard disk drive. Because the amount of data in one or more downloaded instances of PRM content typically surpasses the memory space allocated for application data in memory , and because the primary storage device  features sufficiently large storage capacity, the primary storage device  serves, in one implementation, as a large repository or cache for downloaded PRM content. Alternatively, memory  may be large enough (and fast enough) to accommodate data transfers without the need for the primary storage device .","In one implementation, under the auspices of the real-time operating system  executed by processor , and in coordination with PRM application client , downloaded PRM content and\/or data is received in DHCT  via communications interface  and stored in a temporary buffer in memory . The temporary buffer is implemented and managed to enable data transfers from the temporary buffer to the primary storage device  in concert with the insertion of a newly arriving PRM content into the temporary buffer. The fast access time and high data transfer rate characteristics of primary storage device  enables PRM content and\/or data to be read from the temporary buffer in memory  and written to the storage medium of primary storage device  in a sufficiently fast manner. Orchestration of multiple simultaneous data transfer operations is effected so that while content and\/or data is being transferred from memory  to primary storage device , new PRM content and\/or data (herein media content) is received and stored in the temporary buffer. The coordination of data transfers and lower latency characteristics of primary storage device  enable PRM content to be received by DHCT  at high data rates. The primary storage device  functions to store media content that is received by the DHCT  from the headend  on an interim basis.","For permanent or semi-permanent storage, the secondary storage device  comprises a storage media drive, internally or externally connected to DHCT  in a similar fashion as the primary storage device , but featuring at least one high-capacity removable storage medium and, in one implementation, slower seek-time and lower data transfer rates characteristics. The secondary storage device  is preferably a multiple compact disc (CD) drive or multiple digital video disc (DVD) carousel or magazine drive that at least has write capability, but may also have read capability among other capabilities. Alternatively, the secondary storage device  may be a single CD drive or DVD drive with at least write capability, but may also have read capability among other capabilities, or a video recorder (VCR or D-VCR) or other data recorder. Alternatively, the carousel may be a magazine type. In one implementation, the media content that is received and stored on the primary storage device  is transferred by way of memory  to the secondary storage device  wherein it is written to one or more removable media residing in the secondary storage device . The transfer of PRM content from primary storage device  to secondary storage device  can occur concurrently to the download of the respective PRM contain in a coordinated sequential fashion or after the respective PRM content has been completely received and stored in the primary storage device . In the former case a second temporary buffer in memory  is utilized to implement the transfer of PRM content from the primary storage device  to secondary storage device . Given its faster seek time and higher data transfer rate characteristics, primary storage device  preferably operates faster than the secondary storage device . Alternatively, PRM content is transferred from memory  to the secondary storage device  with higher data rate transfer characteristics, or yet in other embodiments, PRM content is transferred from a remote server or other remote device to a DHCT  communication port and then directly to the secondary storage device .","Also as shown in , the DHCT  preferably includes access to a printer , either connected locally to the DHCT  or via a home communication network via communication port . In one implementation, the printer  prints labels to be applied to the removable media (i.e., CDs or DVDs) of the secondary storage device . Preferably, these labels convey, at least, verification of purchase and authenticity of the data written to the media. Thus, in one implementation, labels are printed by the printer  as a result of an execution signal received by the printer  from the PRM application client  as a result of an authorized purchase of PRM content in which authorization was granted from the head end . Alternatively, DHCT  may operate without the printer .","The PRM client application  configures the DHCT  for the download, purchase, and billing of downloaded purchasable recordable media (PRM) content, including configuring the DHCT  for receipt of trial and impulse purchases of PRM content. The PRM application client  also provides for a user interface for specification of downloading options in cooperation with PRM application server  () and in cooperation with other client applications, for example VOD  and PPV  and Music applications . Alternatively, the user interface may be provided from the head end . Regarding the billing functionality, after a purchase transaction has occurred and the purchase is acknowledged, the purchase is recorded for billing purposes. In one embodiment, the PRM application client  configures the processor  to cause PRM purchase transactions to be stored in the FLASH memory  part of system memory  or in some other designated non-volatile memory section of DHCT  as purchase transactions occur. PRM transaction records and associated fees are transmitted upstream via the OOB upstream channel at designated scheduled times (e.g., during low bandwidth consumption periods) to the billing system . Alternatively, the PRM application server , under the direction of the billing system , may periodically poll individual DHCTs  or group of DHCTs to collect their respective PRM transaction history. PRM transaction records received from the DHCT  by the PRM application server  () are debited from the respective account of the subscriber by the billing system .","The PRM application  also has library functionality for cataloging downloaded recordable media content. Media content information associated with PRM content is transmitted on a regular or periodic basis from PRM application server  () to one or more DHCTs . PRM content information may comprise descriptive information to populate the entries of the first PRM database  or a service guide or the corresponding PRM fields of an electronic program guide (EPG) that is presented to the subscriber via a Graphical-User-Interface (GUI) from which a subscriber can select and request additional descriptive information about respective PRM content titles. Hence, per PRM content information in the displayed presentation to the subscriber, the subscriber can retrieve and view (and hear if applicable) information specific to a PRM content title and proceed to purchase specific PRM content, as will be described in greater detail below.","The PRM client application  can offer the user a plurality of category choices, wherein the user may select from pre-configured categories from an input device such as a wired or wireless keyboard or remote control to classify downloaded PRM content into various categories. Alternatively, the user may enter textual information with an input device in order to create his or her own categories. Hence, downloaded PRM content can be recorded with modified or additional category information. In an alternate embodiment, a user can either download from the PRM application server , or transfer from a personal computer connected to a home communication network, additional information such as graphical information or a still picture to be included with the recording of the PRM content into recordable media inserted in secondary storage device . PRM client application  functionality further includes second database  management capabilities in which records of second database  can be stored in memory , primary storage device , or in a recordable disc inserted in secondary storage device . Management of the second database  extends library functionality to the user for archiving PRM content as well as non-PRM content accessible via the secondary storage device  or a home communication network. Hence, the user is able to archive media content, perform searches (as extended by search capabilities inherent in the database management software program), and edit personal annotations such as the media content category, date recorded, etc. In one embodiment, subscriber network programming, such as for example cable programming, is first recorded\/stored on the primary data buffer (for example, in primary storage device ) which is indexed by content ID and record date\/time information (i.e. meta data). The minimum content ID information collected is the originating channel number but could include program ID (PID) or other media content and media content description information. The record date\/time information is simply the date\/time the recording was made and is used by the system for data management\/purge and can also be used by the subscriber as one of several methods to locate previously recorded media content. The media content recorded in the primary buffer (for example, primary storage device ) is available for viewing and disposition by the subscriber. Media content can be viewed, deleted, or spooled along with the data accessible by universal or widely adopted access and naming conventions (e.g., as is characteristically in meta data) to a secondary buffer (for instance, in secondary storage device ) for longer term storage and playback. Media content left in the primary buffer are subject to be overwritten by new media content. In one embodiment, the secondary buffer is located on removable media that can be stored for future playback.",{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0081","num":"0080"},"figref":["FIG. 5","FIG. 4","FIG. 1"],"b":["500","477","500","414","500","501","502","500","500","510","500","524","522","520","525","526","11","16","16","16","11","522","524","522","524","524","526","522","526","526","522","525","530","534","526","525","526","525","524","522","536","536","538","480"]},"Category display  includes one example default format based on characterizing information corresponding to the purchased recordable media content. In this example, since Titanic is a \u201cmovie\u201d of the \u201cdrama\u201d genre, the category display  lists \u201cdrama\u201d in an outline format and categorizes selections in this medium, DVD#1, as movies. Alternate formats may be displayed as well, such as personalized formats created by the user. The scope of the embodiments of the invention is not limited by how data is formatted on the screen displays. Assuming the Titanic purchase as the first purchased download by the user, the default will be to DVD#1. As illustrated, extended library functionality comprises the capability to not only to catalog media content but each individual medium (i.e., a CD disc or DVD disc) loaded in the carousel or magazine drive of secondary storage device  () by the type (or category) of data stored on them. Category information may comprise, for example, types of music (such as classical, rock, or jazz), types of movies (such as comedy, drama, or horror), or types of software (such as games, word processing, or utilities). Sub-categories further delineate each category, for example, types of games. The library functionality determines if the appropriate disc is loaded in the secondary storage device  () or prompts the user to load the secondary storage device  with the appropriate disc for the media content type that is to be recorded. For example, if rock & roll music, transmitted from the headend  to the DHCT , is being recorded, the library functionality will control the selection of the appropriate medium, for example a CD from the carousel or magazine of the secondary storage device , and load it into the drive for writing of the rock and roll music data to it, as shown in . As another example, if the user chooses to view a drama movie, the library functionality will control the selection of the proper medium, in this case a DVD, from the carousel or magazine of the secondary storage device  and load into the drive for reading of the drama movie data in order to transmit it to a display device, such as for example, a TV display  ().","In , the \u201cA\u201d, \u201cB\u201d, and \u201cC\u201d buttons on the example display screen  correspond to like buttons on the remote control device  to provide certain user interface functionality. For instance, \u201cA\u201d button  suggests to a user that the user can request more PRM content information, as will be explained in greater detail below. The \u201cB\u201d button  suggests editing and search functionality, as will be described in greater detail below. Return Button \u201cC\u201d  suggests that the user can return to the main screen display wherein the purchase was made, for example a VOD catalog screen, or PPV screen.

The amount of bandwidth capacity that can be allocated to the PRM service is finite. Grants for request to download PRM content may be limited during peak-time periods that correspond to high bandwidth consumption by a plurality of other services. On the other hand, off-peak-time periods may feature unused bandwidth capacity intended for other services that can be repossessed for downloading of PRM content.","In one embodiment, the amount of bandwidth capacity allocated for PRM service varies throughout time to reflect bandwidth consumption by a plurality of bandwidth consuming services, including but not limited to VOD services. During peak periods of other bandwidth consuming services such as, for example, video-on-demand (VOD), the amount of bandwidth capacity allocated to the PRM service is less than during the off-peak periods. Consequently, the duration for downloading a PRM content instance during peak-periods is typically longer than the duration for downloading a PRM content instance during off-peak-periods. For example, video on demand off-peak periods may run from 6:00 AM to 11:00 AM during the first week of May. Accordingly, the DNCS  () at the headend  will allot bandwidth for downloading PRM content by repossessing the off-peak bandwidth assigned to video on demand services via a plurality of DTC  channels ().","In one embodiment, referring to , under coordination and communication between content manager  and PRM application server , PRM content is transferred from PRM application server  or other application servers (not shown) to VOD content server  via Ethernet connection  to effect PRM content delivery over repossessed unused bandwidth intended for VOD services. The DNCS  communicates the channel location where unused bandwidth is repossessed to subscriber DHCTs requesting PRM services (i.e. subscribers who have elected downloads of PRM content during these times) resulting in the tuner system  () of a requesting DHCT  to tune to the corresponding channel to receive the downloadable PRM content.","In another embodiment of the invention, again referring to , under coordination and communication between content manager  and PRM application server , purchased PRM content that resides in the PRM application server  or in other application servers are transmitted for product delivery from the server wherein media content resides to the BFS server  via Ethernet connection . A particular PRM content instance may reside indefinitely in BFS server  due to the high demand of that particular content or content instance, or temporarily during times of unused BFS bandwidth. In another embodiment, introduction of new media content releases, such as games or audio content, may reside in the BFS server  for a finite period, such as a month, starting from their introduction time. Alternatively, PRM content may reside in a BFS server  for periods of times in which BFS server  exhibits unused bandwidth capacity.","According to one implementation, bandwidth allocation for PRM service is managed according to a series of recurring sub-schedules consisting of a plurality of non-overlapping time intervals as illustrated in . \u201cN\u201d sub-schedules are illustrated in , with the understanding that a plurality of sub-schedules may appear between sub-schedule #1 and sub-schedule #n. Time intervals are demarcated by time marks , , etc on horizontal time axis , and represent times within a 24 hour period. The interval between these time marks, such as between time marks  and , represent a period during the 24 hour period, for example, 12:00 AM to 4:00 AM. The time mark , continuing the example, would represent 5:00 AM, and its interval will span to time mark , which may be 8:00 AM. The corresponding bandwidth allotted during these time intervals is represented by the blocks over the corresponding time intervals, such as block  over the second time interval bordered between time marks  and . Allocated bandwidth goes from, for example, zero  at the intersection of the horizontal time axis  and vertical bandwidth axis  in sub-schedule#1 to increasing bandwidth when advancing up from zero . Preferably, the time intervals vary in length and are established with demarcation according to collected historical data of bandwidth consumption patterns for a plurality of services. Allocation of bandwidth capacity may vary between one time interval to the next. Pricing for each respective PRM content instance may or may not vary in each of the respective time intervals according to whether the time interval is a peak period or not. For example, during peak periods, such as 6:00 to 10:59 P.M. of the week nights, the recurring schedule may exhibit higher pricing for PRM services whereas during certain, low-demand time periods such as 6:00 to 11:00 A.M of the weekend days the pricing will be lower. As disclosed below, other factors such as demand for new releases and popular media content may also influence pricing. Therefore, allocation of bandwidth capacity for PRM services may be configured to adapt in a time-specific manner according to a plan.","The allocated bandwidth PRM services may be configured to switch as time progresses from a first allocation sub-schedule to a second allocation sub-schedule according to a main schedule that specifies the time interval when each of two or more sub-schedules is to be active as illustrated in . As noted in , the plan may consist, in one embodiment, of scheduling for the year with multiple schedules , further administered with fewer schedules on a per week basis , and administered with even fewer schedules on a daily basis . For example, only one configurable sub-schedule is active at a time throughout the configurable recurring schedule but a first configurable sub-schedule may be active throughout one or more distinct and non-overlapping time intervals of the configurable recurring schedule. The recurrence of the schedule is configured to one of a plurality of time periods such as a weekly, daily, or a monthly recurring schedule.","According to another possible bandwidth allocation schedule, a multiplicity of time-adaptive schedules for each of a multiplicity of recurring schedule choices are pre-configured. In this embodiment, the cable system operator may monitor the bandwidth and PRM service usage and be given the option of manually implementing one of the pre-configured allocation schedules without following a plan.","Alternatively, the DNCS  () may automatically monitor bandwidth usage and automatically select one of the pre-configured schedules. For instance, six different configurations may be available for time-adaptive management of the bandwidth allocated for PRM services for a daily recurring schedule. On the other hand, more than six different arrangements may be necessary when implementing time-adaptive bandwidth management on a weekly recurring schedule.","The pricing system and the allocated bandwidth are inherently related, as the price structure will depend on, among other factors, the time of the download and the duration of the download. In a subscriber network television system that markets PRM content with a plurality of prices, a first subscriber may be willing to pay a premium to immediately download a PRM content instance that is purchased during a peak-period. A second subscriber pays a lesser purchase fee when purchasing a PRM content instance during a peak-period but selecting to downloaded the purchased PRM content instance at a later time corresponding to an off-peak period. In one embodiment, the PRM service offers a plurality of prices for a PRM content instance, and each respective price is associated with a different downloading time and a download duration.","In one implementation wherein VOD excess bandwidth capacity is employed to fulfill a PRM content instance purchase request, and with continued reference to , a \u201csession\u201d between the DHCT  and the PRM application server  is set throughout the course of downloading the PRM content instance. Upon the subscriber purchasing a PRM content instance for a price via the displayed user interface (i.e. the subscriber enters input via an input device and such input may comprise a password or PIN to authenticate authorization to purchase the PRM content instance), as will be described below in greater detail, a purchase transaction is executed by the processor , as configured by the PRM application , that causes a session to be set-up between subscriber network television system resources to the DHCT . As facilitated by session manager  in DNCS  (), a session is a logical entity used to define a connection between the DHCT  and the VOD content server  and the resources used to maintain that connection in the subscriber network television system. Session manager  coordinates and effects the signaling required to implement the session which is preferably defined by the MPEG-2 standard ISO\/IEC 13818-6 IS (MPEG-2 DSM-CC). Upon a session setup request generated by the DHCT  (usually in response to a request from a subscriber), the DNCS  verifies the eligibility of the DHCT  to receive the PRM service. The amount of bandwidth that will be reserved for the duration of the PRM service session is communicated to the relevant servers and headend  components. Via the messaging capabilities of DNCS , the PRM application server  sends a message to the DHCT  that indicates that it is ready to begin delivering the video content using the resources allocated. The DHCT  receives information in the message identifying the QAM modulator that is transmitting the video content (and hence where to tune to receive the requested content) and the bandwidth allocated to deliver the service. After a session has been established, the DHCT  communicates directly with the PRM application server  to facilitate delivery of the requested PRM service. Throughout the course of time that a PRM service is active, further messaging is conducted between the respective DHCT  receiving the PRM content and the PRM application server  to monitor the status of the session.","There are a variety of options available to the user for purchasing PRM content. In one embodiment, as illustrated in , the user is presented with an interactive program guide (IPG)  which has PRM icons next to varied media content selections, suggesting to the user the availability of a downloadable and recordable option for those selections, as indicated in . The icons, and their screen coordinates, can be stored locally as an attribute in each program (i.e. media content) record, like stereo or second audio program (SAP) attributes. The program records can be stored in a database in the DHCT , for example an EPG database or first PRM database . Alternatively, the program records can be maintained at the headend . Any application can display the icon after, for example, the program title in the applications' GUI presentation (e.g. IPG application ). For example, selections Saving Private Ryan and American History under the PPV category  have icon \u201cCD\/DVD\u201d next to them suggesting to the user that these selections are available for downloading to a recordable medium, such as a CD or DVD. In another embodiment, the user may be presented with a service guide (SG) option  such as the example IPG  depicted in . Upon selecting the service guide (SG) option , the user is presented with service selections in a service guide (SG) as illustrated in .  is a screen diagram of an example user service guide (SG) that provides for a plurality of services  with CD\/DVD icons to alert the user to the ability (or inability) to purchase recordable media content. For example, the CD\/DVD icon next to the PPV , VOD , Music , software , and Games  services suggests to the user that these services include selections that are downloadable to a recordable medium. Alternatively, the PRM service  may be a selectable service entity, as illustrated in . Selecting the PRM service  from the service guide  may present various media content options that are purchasable recorded media content, categorized, for example, in media content categories such as music, movies, software, etc.  is a screen diagram of an example VOD selection screen display  responsive to the user entering the VOD catalog selection  in the example service guide  in . A similarly formatted screen may be presented, for example, if the user selects from the service guide  (in ) a PPV selection , or music selection , or software selection . Referring to , the user is presented with a screen display  that includes a select button , which provides the user the ability to rent or purchase the highlighted selection . By pressing the select button , the user is presented with a user interface screen (not shown) that provides the user with an option to either download (purchase) the selected item for recording and thus for indefinite personal possession (i.e. buy), or rent. The PRM service is also integrated into the VOD catalog, in one embodiment, as another option (like price). In one implementation, the system operator may choose what VOD content is available for PRM service and then programs the headend  accordingly. In another implementation, the content provider may offer certain VOD content with PRM service, which is then a feature provided to the user through the headend . Once the user selects the download option (not shown), the user will be presented with the example PRM service screen illustrated in , and which will be described below. Note that the screen display  also includes an information button , which enables the user to learn more about the selection they seek to purchase or rent. If the user selects rent, conventional VOD processing occurs.","Another segue into the pricing system may be by way of an impulse purchase made available during the presentation of a particular media content instance. For example, the user may presented with a pop-up message anytime during the presentation of a VOD movie or a PPV event, which asks the user if he or she would be interested in purchasing this event as PRM content. The pop-up message may occur as an overlay on presented media content in the display screen, or the media content presentation window may narrow to allow the message to appear, or any other manner to present the message on the display screen.","Once the user has decided on a media content selection for downloading, either by entering a selection in an IPG, a service guide, or during the presentation of a particular media content instance as part of an impulse purchase, the user is presented with an example purchase screen , as illustrated in . In one embodiment, this purchase screen  may be invoked as a mini-program located within the PRM application  \u201ccalled\u201d by another application, for example, during a VOD session when the user has selected the purchase option over the rental option, or during a media content instance presentation from a service upon the user requesting an impulse buy. Alternatively, PRM application  functionality may exist as a sub-routine within the current media service application in session. Alternatively, PRM functionality may exist as software in the headend . Purchase screen  includes title header  identifying the media service from which the PRM content instance will be purchased. Subtitle header  suggests the purpose of the purchase screen , which is to select download and price options. The reduced screen area  displays an image from the media content to be purchased. Assuming that the movie selection was Titanic, a picture of a representative scene for the highlighted movie may be presented. Similarly, pictures of representative spreadsheets from a software selected may be displayed, or a picture of a song artist may be displayed for the music selection, all mentioned by way of example. Information section  contains some characterizing information about the media content purchase, including but not limited to media content title, date of composition, rating, download time, and available purchase window. Content quality index  provide the user with content quality options, such as, for example, high definition television or standard definition, surround sound, etc. As with other user interface screens described previously, the user preferably advances highlighted window  over a window  containing the desired content quality by using left scroll arrow  or right scroll arrow . Selections preferably advance until an end is reached in the list, or alternatively, selections may \u201cwrap-around\u201d in a manner whereby the selections repeat themselves. Download option list  contains download options. The user advances the highlighted list entry block  over the list entry block  containing the desired download option by using up arrow  and down arrow , and a corresponding price for that option and content quality is displayed in the price window . The user presses the select button  to purchase the desired selection. The user may select the \u201cB\u201d more movie information button  to learn more details about the movie the user is about to purchase. The user may also select the \u201cC\u201d movie purchases button  to return to the main media content screen, for a example, the VOD catalog screen as illustrated in , to consider other movie purchases.","The price assigned to each available download option may depend on a number of factors. Demand for a PRM content instance such as for new releases and popular media content instances may influence pricing. The amount of bandwidth consumed to download the PRM content instance (and hence the download duration), the time of day, the day of the week (weekday, weekend, or holiday), and the amount of time that the subscriber has to wait until the downloading operation starts also influence the price. Other factors influencing pricing of a PRM content instance include the PRM content type (e.g., audio, movie, or game), the PRM content quality (e.g., CD quality or surround sound quality audio; standard or high-definition picture quality), and the delivery mode (e.g., repossessed VOD excess bandwidth or via BFS services).
