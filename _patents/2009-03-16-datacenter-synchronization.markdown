title: Datacenter synchronization
abstract: A datacenter infrastructure comprising a plurality of datacenters is configured to provide services to users. Data (e.g., application data) provided to respective datacenters from a user is synchronized between different datacenters comprised within “a cloud” according to a multilevel synchronization scheme. Respective levels of the multilevel synchronization operate to transfer different priority (user) data between the plurality of datacenters, wherein respective priorities are determined based upon the importance of the data in providing a service. For example, data used to perform a service is synchronized by a synchronization component facilitating a higher level of synchronization between datacenters, while data not routinely used to perform a service is synchronized by a lower priority synchronization component. Synchronization between datacenters allows a network address routing system to provide substantially uninterrupted routing of a user to an available or otherwise appropriate datacenter within the datacenter infrastructure, thereby providing increased service reliability and performance.

{"@attributes":{"id":"description"},"BRFSUM":[{},{}],"heading":["BACKGROUND","SUMMARY","DETAILED DESCRIPTION"],"p":["Cloud computing refers to the practice of a user utilizing one or more third-party servers to receive services (e.g., run applications, store data, etc.) over a network (e.g., the internet). To achieve this, cloud computing relies upon one or more datacenters (e.g., third party datacenters), respectively comprising a large number of servers. The servers provide services which can be offered to a large number of users through their internet connections. Therefore, a cloud computing architecture allows users to receive services (e.g., data storage, applications, etc.) \u201cfrom the cloud\u201d rather than having to have the services on their personal computer or local network.","Cloud computing is currently prevalent in web based email, where emails are stored on a remote server (and not a local computer), for example. However, due to its advantages over traditional computing, cloud computing is poised to have a much larger impact on the IT sector in the future. Cloud computing offers a number of advantages at least in that entities have to manage significantly less local hardware and software. Therefore, cloud computing offers a means by which services can be conveniently provided to individuals or corporations dispersed over a large geographic area.","This Summary is provided to introduce a selection of concepts in a simplified form that are further described below in the Detailed Description. This Summary is not intended to identify key factors or essential features of the claimed subject matter, nor is it intended to be used to limit the scope of the claimed subject matter.","A technique for improving the reliability of services offered over a network (e.g., the internet) is disclosed. As provided herein, a plurality of geographically diverse mega datacenters (datacenters) form a datacenter infrastructure disposed to host services to one or more users through a cloud or other type of computing environment. Respective services provided by the plurality of datacenters are spread across multiple geographically distinct datacenters by using multiple synchronization components to synchronize data between the datacenters. Since the data is synchronized, the different datacenters can host a service to different users at any or substantially any given time. Essentially, this forms a datacenter infrastructure configured according to an active-active configuration, wherein multiple active datacenters are enabled to provide a service to a particular user, thereby providing increased reliability and redundancy as a hedge against datacenter failures and\/or any other significant outage in a datacenter.","More particularly, the plurality of datacenters are configured to provide services to users according to a multilevel synchronization scheme, wherein respective levels of the scheme operate to transfer different priority (user) data between the plurality of datacenters. A data's priority is determined based upon the importance of the data in providing a service. Data used to routinely perform a service is synchronized by a higher priority synchronization component which facilitates substantially continuous synchronization between datacenters, while data infrequently used to perform a service may be synchronized by a lower priority synchronization component. For example, data comprising a user's password may be regarded as high priority data since it may need to be available whenever the user decides to access protected information and\/or to have a service performed. Similarly, data comprising a user's zip code, for example, may be regarded as lower priority data since that data may not need to be as readily available as it may not be related to the provision of many services.","Synchronization between datacenters allows a network address routing system (e.g., based upon DNS and anycast) to provide substantially uninterrupted routing of a user to an available or otherwise appropriate datacenter within the datacenter infrastructure for a requested service. Specifically, during normal operation, the traffic load of users can be equally balanced between datacenters, whereas during the failure of a datacenter, users can be quickly routed to another active datacenter to mitigate data or service loss.","To the accomplishment of the foregoing and related ends, the following description and annexed drawings set forth certain illustrative aspects and implementations. These are indicative of but a few of the various ways in which one or more aspects may be employed. Other aspects, advantages, and novel features of the disclosure will become apparent from the following detailed description when considered in conjunction with the annexed drawings.","The claimed subject matter is now described with reference to the drawings, wherein like reference numerals are used to refer to like elements throughout. In the following description, for purposes of explanation, numerous specific details are set forth in order to provide a thorough understanding of the claimed subject matter. It may be evident, however, that the claimed subject matter may be practiced without these specific details. In other instances, structures and components are illustrated in block diagram form in order to facilitate describing the claimed subject matter.","In recent years, the growth of high speed data lines, the falling cost of storage, the advent of wireless high speed networks, and the proliferation of handheld devices with web access (e.g., cell phones, PDAs) have lead to the emergence of cloud computing as an attractive alternative to traditional computing (e.g., desktop computing). Cloud computing environments often utilize an interface program (e.g., web browser) to allow users (e.g., clients) to connect to a cloud which is hosted by one or more remote mega datacenters. The one or more remote mega datacenters (datacenters) are disposed to offer services (e.g., applications, data storage, etc.) to a large number of users. Datacenters are complex, often with hundreds of technology and infrastructure pieces (e.g., comprising data storage servers, application servers, etc.) used for proper operation.","In an increasingly digital society, cloud computing offers a number of advantages over conventional desktop computing. It allows users to access their data from their own computer, from someone else's computer, or from a handheld device. It also allows a significant workload shift, no longer relying upon local devices to perform processing to run applications. Therefore, cloud computing forms a highly dependent relationship between the device and the datacenter. Unfortunately, services hosted by these datacenters can fail, often because of infrastructure failures which are outside of the scope of the service. For businesses depending upon services from a cloud such failures can be extremely costly for every minute that service is lost. Therefore, a continued availability of services allows for the successful operation of cloud computing environments. Current solutions provide for an active-passive solution whereby standby datacenters are activated if an active datacenter fails. However, these solutions typically result in a few hours of costly downtime and data loss. Accordingly, a computing environment is described herein which offers improved service and\/or reliability.","As provided herein, a datacenter infrastructure for supporting a cloud or other type of computing environment which provides for an improved reliability of services offered over a network (e.g., the internet) is disclosed. As provided herein, services provided by mega datacenters of a cloud or other type of computing environment are spread across multiple geographically separate datacenters by using multiple synchronization components (multilevel data synchronization) to synchronize data between datacenters. This results in respective datacenters of the datacenter infrastructure having the user data used to provide services to a user. Therefore, the datacenter infrastructure allows a user to be routed to different (e.g., one or more) geographically separate datacenters for a service at a given time, thereby offering continual service by real time rerouting of the user from a failed datacenter to an active datacenter.","In other words, as provided herein, the datacenter infrastructure is configured according to an active-active configuration, wherein multiple active datacenters are enabled to provide a service to a particular user. During a failover of one datacenter such an active-active configuration allows an alternative active datacenter to provide the service with substantially no loss of service to the user.","More particularly, data (e.g., application data, stored data, etc.) provided to a datacenter from a user is synchronized between other datacenters comprised within \u201cthe cloud\u201d according to a multilevel synchronization scheme. Respective levels of the multilevel synchronization scheme operate to transfer different priority user data between the plurality of datacenters, wherein a data's priority is determined based upon the importance of the data in providing a service. For example, data used to routinely perform a service is synchronized by a higher priority synchronization component which facilitates substantially continuous synchronization between datacenters, while data not routinely used to perform a service may be synchronized by a lower priority synchronization component. Synchronization between datacenters allows a network address routing system to provide substantially uninterrupted routing of a user to an available or otherwise appropriate datacenter of the datacenter infrastructure for a requested service. Specifically, during normal operation, the traffic load of users can be equally balanced between datacenters, whereas upon the failure of a datacenter, users can be quickly routed to another active datacenter to mitigate data or service loss.",{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0024","num":"0023"},"figref":["FIG. 1","FIG. 1"],"b":["102","106","104","102","106","102","108","104","110","102","106","116","118","120","104","102"]},"As illustrated in , a multilevel synchronization component  is provided between the datacenters (, , and ) to allow for synchronization of user data between the datacenters. As provided herein, the multilevel synchronization component  performed synchronization depending on a priority of the user data.","Since a plurality of datacenters effectively handle the data received from a user, a service can be provided to the user by one or more of the datacenters during normal operation. This allows for decreased traffic load on a single datacenter. Furthermore, in the event of a failure of a datacenter providing user service, the service can be routed to another datacenter comprised within the datacenter infrastructure to mitigate loss of data or service. For example, in , if datacenter  fails while providing service to the one or more users , then the user's service can be rerouted to datacenter  without substantial interruption since, through synchronization, datacenter  also comprises the user's data.","The cloud computing environment may host a large number of users and an even larger number of services. Because of scalability, multiple users in excess of ten thousand may interact within the cloud. This large number of users causes strain on the datacenter infrastructure. Synchronization of datacenters also allows for controlled traffic routing of user data that can alleviate the strain put on the system and provide improved service to users.","In one particular example, the datacenter infrastructure utilizes a domain name system (DNS) and an anycast routing scheme to provide substantially uninterrupted routing of a user to an available or otherwise appropriate datacenter within the datacenter infrastructure (e.g., ). For example, in the event of a failure of datacenter , user traffic can be rerouted to datacenter  and\/or . Furthermore, since a plurality of datacenters comprise the user data used to provide a service to a user the use of DNS and anycast also allows datacenters to maintain a high availability through balancing user traffic loads between datacenters. For example, in , if one of the one or more users  logs into datacenter , the user's requests can be rerouted to datacenters , , and  so that respective datacenters receive substantially one-third of the traffic from the user, thereby reducing the load on respective datacenters.","In one example, rerouting of traffic may be done after a service transaction is complete. In another example, rerouting of traffic may be done in the middle of a service transaction (e.g., data packet transmission). For example, half of a transaction (e.g., account creation) can be performed with datacenter  and the other half (e.g., sign-in immediately) can be performed with datacenter . The multilevel synchronization may cause user data to be synchronized between datacenters thereby ensuring that datacenters  and  comprise the complete transaction. Therefore, synchronization allows a plurality of datacenters to offer functionality of a single datacenter with improved service and\/or reliability.",{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0030","num":"0029"},"figref":["FIG. 2","FIG. 2","FIG. 2"],"b":["1","1","1","2","1","1","1","2","1","2","2","3","4"]},"During multilevel synchronization, user data is replicated between the first and the second datacenters, DC and DC. This replication allows master copies of the user data to exist on servers comprised within multiple datacenters. Since user data may exist on servers within either datacenter, a user can receive services (e.g., run applications, store data) from either datacenter (e.g., either master server of the multi-master topology).","For example, as illustrated in , during a transaction, data is provided from a user to a local master server (e.g., P) comprised within a datacenter (e.g., datacenter DC). The data is written to the secondary servers (e.g., S and S) and also synchronized to the local master server (e.g., GP) of the other datacenter (e.g., datacenter DC). Therefore, a plurality of servers (P, GP, S, S, S, and S) comprise replicas of the user data.","As provided herein, synchronization is implemented according to multiple synchronization components. To achieve multilevel synchronization, data received from a user is prioritized and respective priorities of user data are synchronized using one of the multiple synchronization components. The use of multiple synchronization components allows for large amounts of data to be synchronized in an ordered manner.","Referring again to , in one example, the active-active configuration of the datacenter infrastructure allows for a high priority user data to be synchronized according to one synchronization component (e.g., synchronously written to master servers in respective active datacenters), while datacenters which do not accept high priority user data directly may be synchronized according to a different synchronization component (e.g., an asynchronous mechanism).",{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0035","num":"0034"},"figref":["FIG. 3","FIG. 3"]},"As illustrated in , determination of the priority associated with user data is determined based upon the importance of the user data in a transaction. For example, user data not routinely used to perform a given service may be placed in a lower priority than user data routinely used to perform the given service. As illustrated in , user data synchronization between datacenters DC and DC is implemented according to three different synchronization components , , and  (e.g., illustrated as arrows). Respective synchronization components are associated with a particular priority. In one example, data used to provide a service to a user is assigned to a highest priority which utilizes a real time synchronization component , data not routinely used to provide a service (and which can therefore be inconsistent during outages) is assigned to a lower priority which utilizes an asynchronous synchronization component , and data which can be inconsistent between datacenters (e.g., data rarely used to provide a service) is assigned to a lowest priority which utilizes an synchronization component  at read time.","For example, a change in user password may be considered to be a piece of data that is kept consistent between datacenters for proper operation of a service, thereby being synchronized according to a high priority real time synchronization. In contrast, a change in a user's zip code may be considered a piece of data where an amount of inconsistency can be tolerated, therefore bring synchronized with a lower priority asynchronous synchronization. Respective priorities allow synchronization dependent upon write availability between datacenters","More particularly, the real time synchronization component  is used to synchronize a highest priority data. In one example, the highest priority data comprises data is kept consistent across datacenters. In such a synchronization, component data is written to the local master servers of a plurality of datacenters comprised within a computing environment (e.g., cloud computing environment) before returning acknowledgment to a user that the data has been received. In the example of , a front end server (FEs) receives user data and simultaneously utilizes a real time synchronization component  to perform a mirrored write request to its local master (e.g., P) and to a remote datacenter's local master (e.g., GP). Since the data is synchronized between datacenters, confirmation from both datacenters, DC and DC, is received before the user is notified that the data has been successfully written. In one example, real time synchronization  may comprise writing data to the datacenters in parallel. By keeping the data routinely used to provide a service consistent across datacenters, different datacenters can provide a service to a user at substantially any given time.","A second, medium priority, asynchronous replication component  may be used for lower priority data. In one example, the medium priority user data comprises data which is kept consistent across a plurality of datacenters in real time, but which can tolerate inconsistencies. In such synchronization, the servers are replicated asynchronously across a plurality of datacenters.  illustrates synchronization of a medium priority data comprised within servers ,  between datacenters according to this synchronization component. It will be appreciated that during failovers user service will proceed since reliable service can be provided without asynchronous synchronization between datacenters.","A third synchronization component may be used for a low priority data. In one example, the low priority data comprises data which can tolerate inconsistencies. In one example, the third synchronization component comprises a snapshot and restore operation during reading of user data from a datacenter (e.g., a snapshot of the data is taken and used to restore the data in other datacenters). This technique allows for the synchronization of large amounts of data, however since it may not be accomplished in real time, for example, inconsistencies may exist between datacenters. Typically this synchronization may be relied upon to facilitate data replication when the volume of data is higher than can be replicated by the other two techniques alone. In one example, a user may read all or substantially all the copies of user data, thereby providing for synchronization of user data to occur at read time.  illustrates synchronization  of non replicated database extensions  according to this synchronization component.",{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0041","num":"0040"},"figref":["FIGS. 4-6","FIGS. 4-6"]},"It will be appreciated that the use of an anycast routing scheme allows a number of datacenters located in different geographic regions to act as if they are in the same place. Therefore, the user receives services as if from a single datacenter, but in reality there are a plurality of datacenters in other locations that can also provide the same service. Wherein the datacenters are configured to use an anycast routing system, the anycast system retains an association with a plurality of different datacenters, which are respectively associated with the same IP address. During normal operation, a service request is provided to the \u201cnearest\u201d active datacenter having the IP address, wherein nearest is a term understood in the art to denote the highest quality datacenter connection (e.g., taking into account a number of variables including the present load on a datacenter, the connection between the user and the datacenter, etc.). Upon failure of the nearest active datacenter, the routing system will reroute service requests to the next nearest active datacenter on the anycast routing system, thereby providing substantially uninterrupted routing of a user to an available or otherwise appropriate datacenter within the datacenter infrastructure.",{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0043","num":"0042"},"figref":["FIG. 4","FIG. 4"],"b":["400","402","404","406","408","410","412","414","408","404","412","408","404","408","404","410","406"]},"In one particular example, respective datacenters,  and , are assigned the same two IP addresses, a first IP address (A.b.c.d.1) and a second IP address (A.b.c.d.2). The IP addresses form an inverse priority hierarchy for incoming data between the two datacenters. For example, for datacenter  the DNS assigns the first IP address (A.b.c.d.1) as a high priority IP address (e.g., for high priority traffic) and the second IP address (A.b.c.d.2) as a low priority IP address (e.g., for low priority traffic). Whereas, for datacenter  the DNS assigns the first IP address (A.b.c.d.1) as a low priority IP address and the second IP address (A.b.c.d.2) as a low priority IP address. During normal operation the first user's computer  connects to the datacenter  using the first (high priority) IP address (A.b.c.d.1) and the second user's computer  connects to datacenter  using a second (high priority) IP address (A.b.c.d.2).",{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0045","num":"0044"},"figref":"FIG. 5","b":["400","404","408","408","404","408","406"]},"More particularly, during a controlled failover the service provided to the first user's computer  will remain on the same IP address (A.b.c.d.1), but will be rerouted from datacenter  to datacenter . This will result in datacenter  receiving data from the second user's computer  on a high priority IP address (A.b.c.d.2) and data from the first user's computer  on a low priority IP address (A.b.c.d.1). Therefore, the first user's computer  will not have to switch IP addresses during a controlled failover.",{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0047","num":"0046"},"figref":["FIG. 6","FIG. 6"]},"For example, as illustrated in  the connection between the first user's computer  and datacenter , based upon the first IP address (A.b.c.d.1), fails. The first user's computer  changes IP addresses to the second IP address (A.b.c.d.2) and is rerouted datacenter . This will cause the first user's computer  to automatically transmit exclusively to the second IP address (A.b.c.d.2) and therefore will cause instantaneous failover since the anycast system will once again relook for the nearest datacenter to provide service to the user. This automatic failover mitigates service downtime.",{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0049","num":"0048"},"figref":"FIG. 7","b":["700","700"]},"At  data is received by a datacenter, from a user transaction, and is prioritized. The priority of data respectively corresponds to a synchronization component used to synchronize data between datacenters of a datacenter infrastructure. That is, based upon the priority of the data, a datacenter can determine a synchronization component by which to synchronize the data with other datacenters. In one example, data is prioritized into three different priorities: data that cannot tolerate inconsistencies between datacenters, data that can tolerate minor inconsistencies, and data that can tolerate major inconsistencies.","Real time synchronization requests are made to write user data to a plurality of datacenters at . The real time synchronization requests are associated with the highest priority user data (e.g., data which cannot tolerate inconsistencies between datacenters). The requests are made to respective datacenters comprised within a datacenter infrastructure comprising a plurality of datacenters. In one example, requests are made by a front end server comprised within a datacenter that is providing a service to a user.","At  responses for the real time synchronization requests are checked for. A response to the real time synchronization requests will tell the requester whether or not the data has successfully been written to the plurality of datacenters and therefore whether the data is synchronized across the datacenters. In one example, the front end server providing the user server may receive the requests.","A decision whether or not to proceed with the user service is made based upon the responses received at . If requests are not received from the active datacenters, then it is assumed that the data is not synchronized across the datacenters and a decision is made not to proceed. If requests are received from the active datacenters, then it is confirmed that the data has been synchronized across datacenters, a decision is made to proceed, and a confirmation is sent to the user that the data has been successfully stored.","Additional synchronization may be performed between the datacenters at . The additional synchronization relates to the synchronization of the lower priority data. In one example, the additional synchronization comprises performing an asynchronous replication of data which can tolerate inconsistencies between the plurality of datacenters and\/or performing a synchronization between the plurality of datacenters during at read time which is implemented by using a snapshot of the data to replicate the data to other datacenters.","Still another embodiment involves a computer-readable medium comprising processor-executable instructions configured to implement one or more of the techniques presented herein.
