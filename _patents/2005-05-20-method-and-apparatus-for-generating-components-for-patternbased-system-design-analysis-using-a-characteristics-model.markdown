The resulting software developed using this evolving software technology has become more complex. The ability to manage the quality of software applications (including design quality and architecture quality) is becoming increasingly more difficult as a direct result of the increasingly complex software. In an effort to manage the quality of software applications, several software development tools and approaches are now available to aid software developers in managing software application quality. The following is a summary of some of the types of quality management tools currently available.","One common type of quality management tool is used to analyze the source code of the software application to identify errors (or potential errors) in the source code. This type of quality management tool typically includes functionality to parse the source code written in a specific programming language (e.g., Java\u2122, C++, etc.) to determine whether the source code satisfies one or more coding rules (i.e., rules that define how source code in the particular language should be written). Some quality management tools of the aforementioned type have been augmented to also identify various coding constructs that may result in security or reliability issues. While the aforementioned type of quality management tools corrects coding errors, it does not provide the software developer with any functionality to verify the quality of the architecture of software application.","Other quality management tools of the aforementioned type have been augmented to verify that patterns have been properly implemented. Specifically, some quality management tools of the aforementioned type have been augmented to allow the software developer to indicate, in the source code, the type of pattern the developer is using. Then the quality management tool verifies, during compile time, that the pattern was used\/implemented correctly.","In another implementation of the aforementioned type of quality management tools, the source code of the software is parsed and the components (e.g., classes, interfaces, etc.) extracted from the parsing are subsequently combined in a relational graph (i.e., a graph linking all (or sub-sets) of the components). In a subsequent step, the software developer generates an architectural design, and then compares the architectural design to the relational graph to determine whether the software application conforms to the architectural pattern. While the aforementioned type of quality management tool enables the software developer to view the relationships present in the software application, it does not provide the software developer with any functionality to conduct independent analysis on the extracted components.","Another common type of quality management tool includes functionality to extract facts (i.e., relationships between components (classes, interfaces, etc.) in the software) and subsequently displays the extracted facts to the software developer. While the aforementioned type of quality management tool enables the software developer to view the relationships present in the software application, it does not provide the developer with any functionality to independently query the facts or any functionality to extract information other than facts from the software application.","Another common type of quality management tool includes functionality to extract and display various statistics (e.g., number of lines of code, new artifacts added, software packages present, etc.) of the software application to the software developer. While the aforementioned type of quality management tool enables the software developer to view the current state of the software application, it does not provide the developer with any functionality to verify the quality of the architecture of the software application.","In general, in one aspect, the invention relates to a method for analyzing a target system, comprising obtaining a characteristics model, generating at least one selected from the group consisting of a schema, characteristics store API, and a characteristics extractor, using the characteristics model, obtaining a plurality of characteristics from the target system using characteristics extractor, wherein each of the plurality of characteristics is associated with the characteristics model, storing each of the plurality of characteristics in the characteristics store using the schema, and analyzing the target system by issuing at least one query to the characteristics store to obtain an analysis result.","In general, in one aspect, the invention relates to a system, comprising a characteristics model, a target system comprising a plurality of characteristics, at least one characteristics extractor configured to obtain at least one of the plurality of characteristics from the target system, a characteristics store configured to store the at least one of the plurality of characteristics obtained from the target system using a schema and a characteristics store API, and a query engine configured to analyze the target system by issuing at least one query to the characteristics store and configured to obtain an analysis result in response to the at least one query, wherein at least one selected from the group consisting of the schema, the characteristics store API, and the characteristics extractor is generated using the characteristics model.","In general, in one aspect, the invention relates to a computer readable medium comprising software instructions for analyzing a target system, comprising software instructions to obtain a characteristics model, generating at least one selected from the group consisting of a schema, characteristics store API, and a characteristics extractor, using the characteristics model, obtain the plurality of characteristics from the target system using characteristics extractor, wherein each of the plurality of characteristics is associated with the characteristics model, store each of the plurality of characteristics in the characteristics store using the schema, and analyze the target system by issuing at least one query to the characteristics store to obtain an analysis result.","Other aspects of the invention will be apparent from the following description and the appended claims.","Exemplary embodiments of the invention will be described with reference to the accompanying drawings. Like items in the drawings are shown with the same reference numbers.","In the exemplary embodiment of the invention, numerous specific details are set forth in order to provide a more thorough understanding of the invention. However, it will be apparent to one of ordinary skill in the art that the invention may be practiced without these specific details. In other instances, well-known features have not been described in detail to avoid obscuring the invention.","In general, embodiments of the invention relate to a method and apparatus for pattern-based system design analysis. More specifically, embodiments of the invention provide a method and apparatus for using one or more characteristics models, one or more characteristics extractors, and a query engine configured to query the characteristics of a target system to analyze the system design. Embodiments of the invention provide the software developer with a fully configurable architectural quality management tool that enables the developer to extract information about the characteristics of the various artifacts in the target system, and then issue queries to determine specific details about the various artifacts including, but not limited to, information such as: number of artifacts of the specific type present in the target system, relationships between the various artifacts in the target system, the interaction of the various artifacts within the target system, the patterns that are used within the target system, etc.",{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0020","num":"0019"},"figref":"FIG. 1","b":["100","100","100"]},"As shown in , the system includes the following components to aid in the analysis of the target system: one or more characteristics extractors (e.g., characteristics extractor A (A), characteristics extractor N (N)), a characteristics store application programming interface (API) (), a characteristics store (), a characteristics model (), a query engine (), and interface (). Each of these components is described below.","In one embodiment of the system, the characteristics model () describes artifacts (i.e., discrete components) in a particular domain. In one embodiment of the invention, the domain corresponds to any grouping of \u201crelated artifacts\u201d (i.e., there is a relationship between the artifacts). Examples of domains include, but are not limited to, a Java\u2122 2 Enterprise Edition (J2EE) domain (which includes artifacts such as servlets, filters, welcome file, error page, etc.), a networking domain (which includes artifacts such as web server, domain name server, network interface cards, etc), and a DTrace domain, Java\u2122 domain (described below). In one embodiment of the invention, each characteristics model includes one or more artifacts, one or more relationships describing the interaction between the various artifacts, and one or more characteristics that describe various features of the artifact. An example of a characteristics model () is shown in . Those skilled in the art will appreciate that the system may include more than one characteristics model ().","In one embodiment of the invention, the use of characteristics model(s) () enables a user to analyze the target system () with respect to a specific domain. Further, the use of multiple characteristics models allows the user to analyze the target system () across multiple domains. In addition, the use of multiple characteristics models allows the user to analyze the interaction between various domains on the target system ().","In one embodiment of the invention, the characteristics extractors (e.g., characteristics extractor A (A), characteristics extractor N (N)) are used to obtain information about various artifacts (i.e., characteristics) defined in the characteristics model (). In one embodiment of the invention, the characteristics model () is used to generate the characteristics extractor (e.g., characteristics extractor A (A), characteristics extractor N (N)). In one embodiment of the invention, the characteristics extractors (characteristics extractor A (A), characteristics extractor N (N)) are generated manually using the characteristics model (). Alternatively, the characteristics extractors (e.g., characteristics extractor A (A), characteristics extractor N (N)) are generated automatically using the characteristics model ().","In one embodiment of the invention, the characteristics extractor (e.g., characteristics extractor A (A), characteristics extractor N (N)) corresponds to an agent loaded on the target system () that is configured to monitor and obtain information about the artifacts in the target system (). Alternatively, the characteristics extractor (e.g., characteristics extractor A (A), characteristics extractor N (N)) may correspond to an interface that allows a user to manually input information about one or more artifacts. In another embodiment of the invention, the characteristics extractor (e.g., characteristics extractor A (A), characteristics extractor N (N)) may correspond to a process (or system) configured to obtain information about one or more artifacts in the target system () by monitoring network traffic received by and sent from the target system ().","In another embodiment of the invention, the characteristics extractor (e.g., characteristics extractor A (A), characteristics extractor N (N)) may correspond to a process (or system) configured to obtain information about one or more artifacts in the target system () by sending requests (e.g., pinging, etc.) for specific pieces of information about artifacts in the target system () to the target system (), or alternatively, sending requests to the target system and then extracting information about the artifacts from the responses received from target system ().","In one embodiment of the invention, if the target system () corresponds to source code and the characteristics model () corresponds to a formal specification of a programming language (e.g., Java\u2122), then the characteristics extractor (e.g., characteristics extractor A (A), characteristics extractor N (N)) may correspond to a process that is configured to parse the source code and temporarily store the artifacts and characteristics obtained from parsing the source code in an in-memory object graph.","Those skilled in the art will appreciate that different types of characteristics extractors may be used to obtain information about artifacts in the target system (). Further, those skilled in the art will appreciate that each characteristics extractor (or set of characteristics extractors) is associated with a particular characteristics model. Thus, each characteristics extractor typically only retrieves information about artifacts described in the characteristics model with which the characteristics extractor is associated. Furthermore, if there are multiple characteristics models in the system, then each characteristics model may be associated with one or more characteristics extractors.","The information about the various artifacts in the target system () obtained by the aforementioned characteristics extractors (characteristics extractor A (A), characteristics extractor N (N)) is stored in the characteristics store () via the characteristic store API (). In one embodiment of the invention, characteristics store API () provides an interface between the various characteristics extractors (characteristics extractor A (A), characteristics extractor N (N)) and the characteristics store (). Further, the characteristics store API () includes information about where in the characteristics store () each characteristic obtained from the target system () should be stored.","In one embodiment of the invention, the characteristics store () corresponds to any storage that includes functionality to store characteristics in a manner that allows the characteristics to be queried. In one embodiment of the invention, the characteristics store () may correspond to a persistent storage device (e.g., hard disk, etc). In one embodiment of the invention, the characteristics store () corresponds to a relational database that may be queried using a query language such as Structure Query Language (SQL). Those skilled in the art will appreciate that any query language may be used. In one embodiment of the invention, if the characteristics store () is a relational database, then the characteristics model () may be used to generate a schema for storing the characteristics associated with the particular characteristics model (). Those skilled in the art will appreciate that each characteristics model () within the system may be associated with a separate schema.","In one embodiment of the invention, the schema generated from the characteristics model () may include a table for each artifact where each table is configured to store all the characteristics for each instance of the artifact in the target system. Further, the relationships between the individual artifacts, as described in the characteristics model (), may be implemented in the schema in the following manner: (i) for 1:1 relationships between artifacts, the primary key of one of the artifacts in the relationship is placed as a foreign key in the table corresponding to the other artifact in the relationship; (ii) for 1:n relationships between artifacts, the primary key for the artifact on the \u201c1\u201d side of the relationship is placed as a foreign key in the table corresponding to the artifact on the \u201cn\u201d side of the relationship; (iii) for m:n relationships between artifacts, a join table is created and the primary keys for each artifact in the relationship are placed in the join table as foreign keys. An example of a schema is included below. Those skilled in the art will appreciate that other schema implementations may be used in accordance with one or more embodiments of the invention.","In one embodiment of the invention, if the characteristics store () is a relational database that includes a schema generated from the characteristics model (), then the characteristics store API () includes the necessary information to place characteristics obtained from target system () in the appropriate tables in the characteristics store (). Specifically, the characteristics store API () may include information about which table in the characteristics store () to place specific pieces of information about artifacts in the target system (). In one embodiment of the invention, the characteristics store API () is generated using the characteristics model ().","In one embodiment of the invention, if the characteristics extractors are configured to temporarily store artifacts and characteristics obtained from the target system in an in-memory object graph, then the characteristics store API () is configured to populate the characteristics store () using the populated in-memory object graph. In one embodiment of the invention, characteristics store API () populates the characteristics store () by traversing the in-memory object graph and, for each artifact or characteristic encountered, determining where in the characteristics store () to store the artifact or characteristics, in accordance with the schema generated using the characteristics model with which the artifacts and characteristics are associated. In one embodiment of the invention, if the characteristics store () includes multiple schemas, then the characteristics store API () includes functionality to search the characteristics store () for the schema associated with the particular artifacts and\/or characteristics. In one embodiment of the invention, all the characteristics store API () having aforementioned functionality and\/or configuration is automatically generated using the characteristics model ().","In one embodiment of the invention, the characteristics store API () is automatically generated from the characteristics model () in the following manner: (i) the desired functionality of the characteristics store API () (e.g., the functionality described in the preceding paragraphs) is formally specified; (ii) a characteristics model () that formally specifies artifacts and characteristics upon which the characteristics store API () is going to operate on (i.e., perform actions upon) is obtained; and (iii) both of the aforementioned formal specifications are input into a code generator to generate the resulting characteristics store API (). Those skilled in the art will appreciate that additional information such as execution environment (e.g., operating system, hardware platform, configuration of the characteristics store (), etc.) may also need to be specified prior to generating the characteristics store API ().","In one embodiment of the invention, the aforementioned characteristics store API () generated in accordance with aforementioned embodiment corresponds to one or more data access objects (DAO). In one embodiment of the invention, each DAO corresponds to an object that provides an abstraction layer between the characteristics extractors and the characteristics store (). In particular, DAOs may be created by and then receive characteristics from the characteristics extractors. Once the DAOs have received the characteristics from the characteristics extractors, the DAOs proceed to store the characteristics in the characteristics store (). Those skilled in the art will appreciate that the DAOs include the necessary functionality to store the characteristics in the correct table in the characteristics store ().","In one embodiment of the invention, characteristics extractors and the characteristics store API () are automatically generated from the characteristics model () as described above with respect to the characteristics store API (). In this embodiment of the invention, the characteristics model () is used to automatically generate a web-application having a front-end that corresponds to a characteristics extractor and a back-end that corresponds to a characteristics store API ().","In particular, the front-end of the web-application corresponds to one or more web pages that enable a user to perform one or more of the following actions: add an entry, modify an entry, view an entry, search for an entry (or multiple entries), and delete an entry, where the entry corresponds to an artifact or characteristics within (or to be stored in) the characteristics store (). In one embodiment of the invention, the back-end of the web-application corresponds to one or more DAOs (as described above) configured to perform the action requested by the user (i.e., the action request via the front-end of the web-application).","Continuing with the discussion of , in one embodiment of the invention, the query engine () is configured to issue queries to the characteristics store (). In one embodiment of the invention, the queries issued by the query engine () enable a user (e.g., a system developer, etc.) to analyze the target system (). In particular, in one embodiment of the invention, the query engine () is configured to enable the user to analyze the presence of specific patterns in the target system as well as the interaction between various patterns in the target system.","In one embodiment of the invention, a pattern corresponds to a framework that defines how specific components in the target system should be configured (e.g., what types of information each component should manage, what interfaces should each component expose), and how the specific components should communicate with each other (e.g., what data should be communicated to other components, etc.). Patterns are typically used to address a specific problem in a specific context (i.e., the software\/system environment in which the problem arises). Said another way, patterns may correspond to a software architectural solution that incorporates best practices to solve a specific problem in a specific context.","Continuing with the discussion of , the query engine () may also be configured to issue queries about interaction of specific patterns with components that do not belong to a specific pattern. Further, the query engine () may be configured to issue queries about the interaction of components that do not belong to any patterns.","In one embodiment of the invention, the query engine () may include pre-specified queries and\/or enable to the user to specify custom queries. In one embodiment of the invention, both the pre-specified queries and the custom queries are used to identify the presence of one or more patterns and\/or the presence of components that do not belong to a pattern in the target system (). In one embodiment of the invention, the pre-specified queries and the custom queries are specified using a Pattern Query Language (PQL). In one embodiment of the invention, PQL enables the user to query the artifacts and characteristics of the artifacts stored in the characteristics store () to determine the presence of a specific pattern, specific components of a specific pattern, and\/or other components that are not part of a pattern, within the target system ().","In one embodiment of the invention, the query engine () may include information (or have access to information) about the characteristics model () that includes the artifact and\/or characteristics being queried. Said another way, if the query engine () is issuing a query about a specific artifact, then the query engine () includes information (or has access to information) about the characteristics model to which the artifact belongs. Those skilled in the art will appreciate that the query engine () only requires information about the particular characteristics model () to the extent the information is required to issue the query to the characteristics store ().","Those skilled in the art will appreciate that the query engine () may include functionality to translate PQL queries (i.e., queries written in PQL) into queries written in a query language understood by the characteristics store () (e.g., SQL). Thus, a query written in PQL may be translated into an SQL query prior to being issued to the characteristics store (). In this manner, the user only needs to understand the artifacts and\/or characteristics that the user wishes to search for and how to express the particular search using PQL. The user does not need to be concerned with how the PQL query is handled by the characteristics store ().","Further, in one or more embodiments of the invention, PQL queries may be embedded in a programming language such as Java\u2122, Groovy, or any other programming language capable of embedding PQL queries. Thus, a user may embed one or more PQL queries into a program written in one of the aforementioned programming languages. Upon execution, the program issues one or more PQL queries embedded within the program and subsequently receives and processes the results prior to displaying them to the user. Those skilled in the art will appreciate that the processing of the results is performed using functionality of the programming language in which the PQL queries are embedded.","In one embodiment of the invention, the results of the individual PQL queries may be displayed using the interface (). In one embodiment of the invention, the interface () is configured to output the results of the queries on a display device (i.e., monitor, printer, projector, etc.).","As discussed above, each characteristics model defines one or more artifacts, one or more relationships between the artifacts, and one or more characteristics for each artifact. In one embodiment of the invention, the characteristics model corresponds to a formal specification of a domain.
