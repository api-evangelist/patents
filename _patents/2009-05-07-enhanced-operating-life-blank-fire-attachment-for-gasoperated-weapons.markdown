No. 11\/306,647, filed Jan. 5, 2006, which copending application claims priority from U.S. provisional patent applications 60\/593,397 filed on Jan. 11, 2005, and, 60\/595,521 filed on Jul. 12, 2005; the contents of Ser. Nos. 11\/306,647, 60\/593,397 and 60\/595,521 are incorporated herein by reference.","The inventions described herein may be manufactured, used and licensed by or for the U.S. Government for U.S. Government purposes.","The invention relates in general to firearms and in particular to an adaptor which permits gas-operated or gas-assisted firearms to properly operate when firing blank ammunition.","When firing a gas-operated or gas-assisted firearm, the backpressure generated by the propellant gases as the bullet traverses the bore is used to automatically cycle the operating group of the weapon. When firing low impulse ammunition such as blank cartridges, it is often necessary to use a Blank Firing Attachment (BFA) to generate sufficient backpressure to cycle the weapon. The BFA typically attaches to the muzzle end of the weapon's barrel.","The prior art BFA's used by the United States Army on gas-operated rifles and small and medium caliber machine guns utilize a cylindrical threaded stem and a housing that attaches to the weapon's muzzle compensator or flash suppressor. The threaded stem traverses axially during installation until the lower portion of the stem contacts either an internal feature of the muzzle device, a crush that sits between the muzzle device and barrel crown, or the barrel crown itself, at which point the bore is sealed. To prevent overpressure in the bore during firing, excess gas is released into the atmosphere through a bleed hole leading from an axial cavity in the BFA stem. Despite its use on the M4\/M16 rifles, M249 Squad Automatic Weapon, and M240 Machine Gun, this style BFA does have several shortcomings.","Until now, the BFA design used by the U.S. Army is the subject matter of U.S. Pat. No. 5,325,758, entitled \u201cBlank Firing Attachment\u201d issued on Jul. 5, 1994 to Compton et al. (hereinafter \u201cCompton\u201d). Compton recognized that the threaded stem, exposed to corrosive gases when firing blanks, and stated that it must be manufactured of a material to withstand such gases, specifically, specifying ASTM A331 Grade 4140 cold finished steel.","Prior U.S. Pat. No. 3,766,822, entitled Blank Firing Adaptor for Gas Operated Firearms, issued Oct. 23, 1973 to Sophinos, disclosed an adaptor substantively identical in overall design to that disclosed herein; which uses a plug in place of the threaded stem disclosed by Compton. Sophinos, like Compton, merely states that the plug should be formed of a suitable heat resistant, rugged, fragible material such as steel. Such steel threaded stems or plugs, used by Compton, Sophinos, and the prior art, quickly erodes due to the corrosive gases after firing only a finite number of such rounds, often, as few as 200 rounds. This erosion of the threaded stem, or plug, allows excessive escape of propellant gases generated by the firing of the blank cartridge and therefore there is insufficient back-pressure to automatically cycle the operating group of the gas-operated weapon. Therefore, there is a need in the art for a BFA which will allow firing at least an order of magnitude more rounds, before failing.","The present invention is a blank firing attachment for a gas-operated weapon having a barrel, the barrel having a bore with a cross-sectional area, the blank firing attachment comprising a housing having first and second ends; a stem supported at the first end of the housing and extending along a longitudinal axis of the housing, the stem for insertion into the bore of the barrel, the stem having a cross-sectional area less than the cross-sectional area of the bore; and means for attaching the housing to the weapon; wherein, upon firing a blank cartridge in the weapon, a difference between the cross-sectional area of the bore and the cross-sectional area of the stem is an area small enough to generate sufficient backpressure in the bore as to operate the weapon and large enough to bleed excess gas from the system as to prevent an overpressure condition in the bore. With the stem being manufactured of tungsten carbide (otherwise known as carbide, or cemented carbide), it has surprisingly been found that over 10,000 blank rounds can be fired before the stem erodes to the point that there was insufficient back-pressure for the gas operated weapon to cycle properly. Further, tungsten carbide lends itself to such an application, as it is economical, readily available, and commercially produced in stock sizes comparable to the various stem diameters required for various weapons.","To minimize erosion, it is preferred that the stem be manufactured of tungsten carbide have a uniform microstructure, with a maximum grain size of less than 1 micron; a minimum tungsten carbide content of about 80%; a minimum cobalt content of about 10%, and a minimum hardness on the Rockwell A scale of about 91. A more preferred tungsten carbide conforms to the International Organization for Standardizations (ISO) standard 513, K20 to K30 tungsten carbides, which require, tungsten carbide content of about 84 to about 90 mass %; cobalt content of 10 to about 16 mass %; a grain size of about 0.6 to about 0.8 microns (i.e. ultra fine to micro fine grade). Further, K20 to K30 tungsten carbide, has a Ra hardness of about 91.4 to about 91.8; transverse rupture strength of about 4 to about 4.3 GPa; fracture toughness of about 7.5 to about 8.7 MPa-mand density of about 13.7 to about 14.5 g\/cm.","The barrel end of the weapon includes a circumferential groove formed in an exterior surface thereof. The means for attaching the housing to the weapon comprises a flange at the second end of the housing, guides formed on the flange and a retainer that reciprocates in the guides and fits in the circumferential groove in the barrel end of the weapon.","If the barrel end of the weapon comprises a barrel, the circumferential groove is formed in the barrel. If the barrel end of the weapon comprises a muzzle device, the circumferential groove is formed in the muzzle device.","Another aspect of the invention is an apparatus comprising a gas-operated weapon having a barrel, the barrel having a bore with a cross-sectional area; and a blank firing attachment attached to the weapon, the blank firing attachment comprising a housing having first and second ends; a stem supported at the first end of the housing and extending along a longitudinal axis of the housing, a part of the stem being inserted into the bore of the barrel, the stem having a cross-sectional area less than the cross-sectional area of the bore; and means for attaching the housing to the weapon; wherein, upon firing a blank cartridge in the weapon, a difference between the cross-sectional area of the bore and the cross-sectional area of the stem is an area small enough to generate sufficient backpressure in the bore as to operate the weapon and large enough to bleed excess gas from the system as to prevent an overpressure condition in the bore.","The barrel end of the weapon includes a circumferential groove formed in an exterior surface thereof, the means for attaching the housing to the weapon comprising a flange at the second end of the housing, guides formed on the flange and a retainer that reciprocates in the guides and fits in the circumferential groove in the barrel end of the weapon. If the barrel end of the weapon comprises the barrel, the circumferential groove is formed in the barrel. If the barrel end of the weapon comprises a muzzle device, the circumferential groove is formed in the muzzle device.","Yet another aspect of the invention is a muzzle device for a weapon having a barrel end that includes a circumferential groove formed in an exterior surface thereof, the muzzle device comprising a housing; a flange attached to the housing; guides formed on the flange; and a retainer that reciprocates in the guides and fits in the circumferential groove in the barrel end of the weapon.","If the barrel end of the weapon comprises a barrel, the circumferential groove is formed in the barrel. If the barrel end of the weapon comprises a second muzzle device, the circumferential groove is formed in the second muzzle device.","The retainer including a pair of spaced apart legs that fit in the guides, the pair of spaced apart legs also fitting in the circumferential groove in the barrel end of the weapon. One of the guides includes a pin fixed therein and a corresponding one of the pair of legs includes a slot of reduced thickness extending partially along its length, the pin engaging the slot to allow the retainer to reciprocate in the guides and the pin butting against an end of the slot to maintain the retainer at least partially in the guides.","The muzzle device further comprises a flat spring attached to the flange on a side opposite the guides, a stop that extends through the flange and has a head against which the flat spring bears and further wherein, when the pair of legs of the retainer fully engage the circumferential groove in the barrel end of the weapon, the stop abuts the retainer to prevent the retainer from disengaging from the circumferential groove.","The invention will be better understood, and further objects, features, and advantages thereof will become more apparent from the following description of the preferred embodiments, taken in conjunction with the accompanying drawings.","The present invention includes a BFA for gas-operated and gas-assisted weapons. The BFA attaches to the muzzle end of a gun barrel and generates sufficient backpressure to automatically cycle the operating group of the weapon when firing blank ammunition. The BFA may be used with all semi and fully-automatic gas-operated and gas-assisted weapons. To properly cycle the weapon action, a predetermined optimized clearance between the outer diameter of the BFA stem and the inner diameter of the barrel bore is essential. This designed clearance must be maintained with as little variability as possible to facilitate the consistent operational pressure levels that are required for proper weapon powering.",{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0045","num":"0044"},"figref":["FIG. 1","FIG. 1B","FIG. 1B"],"b":["24","26","26","14","26","28","14","26","24","22","26","14","14","26"]},{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0046","num":"0045"},"figref":["FIG. 1A","FIG. 1B","FIG. 1A","FIG. 1C","FIG. 1B","FIG. 1B"],"b":["10","1","1","10","26","24","26","28","14","14","16","16","14","18"]},{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0047","num":"0046"},"figref":["FIG. 2A","FIG. 1A","FIG. 2B","FIG. 2A","FIG. 2C","FIG. 2A","FIG. 2D","FIG. 2A","FIG. 1B"],"b":["10","10","30","32","34","20","32","30","30","20","32","30","64"]},"Part of the stem  is inserted into the bore  of the barrel , as best seen in .

With the BFA  installed, the lower portion  of pin  of the stem  is positioned inside the bore , as seen in . When a blank cartridge is fired, the decreased cross sectional area available for the gas to escape causes the gas pressure inside the bore  to increase, thereby providing sufficient backpressure to cycle the weapon. A sectional view of the gap between the stem  and barrel  is shown in the enlarged view of .","The difference between the cross-sectional area of the bore  and the cross-sectional area of the stem  is an area small enough to generate sufficient backpressure in the bore  as to operate the weapon and large enough to bleed excess gas from the system as to prevent an overpressure condition in the bore . Therefore, the diameter of stem  (in particular, pin portion ) will vary depending on the particular model of weapon , the diameter of the bore  of the model weapon , and the length of barrel  of the model weapon .","A BFA  for the U.S. Army's M249 Squad Automatic Weapon in the short barrel configuration has an optimum stem diameter (pin  diameter) of 0.198-0.002 inch. This optimized diameter assumes the end of the lower portion  of pin  of the stem  is positioned inside the bore  a distance of 0.125 inch to 0.225 inch as measured from the barrel crown .","Because the clearance area between the BFA stem  and barrel bore  is the limiting factor that regulates the mass flow of excess gas and resultant backpressure in the bore, a small change in this clearance area has the potential to significantly affect weapon powering. To maintain consistent weapon powering, the clearance area must be precisely controlled.","Manufacturing tolerances and material erosion of both the BFA stem  and barrel  influence the extent to which the designed clearance area will vary. Manufacturing tolerances are important because of the squared relationship between diameter and circular area. A small variation in diameter results in a larger variation in area. Therefore, in addition to tightly controlling the outer diameter tolerance of the BFA stem , the ideal interfacing feature is also precisely manufactured and dimensionally controlled using tight tolerances. Prior art BFAs use mating surfaces that are internally located in muzzle devices or in other parts, such as crush washers located between the muzzle device and barrel crown. In the present invention, the barrel bore itself is the interface for the BFA stem, because the barrel bore is fabricated using sufficiently tight dimensional tolerances.","Material erosion will also affect the variability in clearance area by increasing the diametric clearance between BFA stem and barrel bore as the total number of blank ammunition rounds fired using a given BFA and barrel increases. Inevitably the diametric clearance will increase and cause the level of generated backpressure to progressively lessen. To minimize this phenomenon, it is critical that the BFA stem, be manufactured of tungsten carbide, as discussed above and detailed below. Further, it is important, to maintain precise diametric clearance initially by controlling dimensional tolerances and is an additional reason to implement an interface within the barrel bore. Most of the barrels used in gas-operated rifles and small and medium caliber machine guns have chrome coated bores, which increases the wear resistance of the bore against material erosion. Similarly, the BFA stem material is important in that it must be able to sufficiently withstand such erosion.","The components of the BFA  may be fabricated through a series of machining, or casting with finish machining, and stamping operations. Heat treatment and surface coatings for components of the BFA are similar to those of the current practices associated with known blank firing attachments. Regarding the BFA stem  (i.e. pin ), it is critical that the material of manufacture be tungsten carbide, preferably having a uniform microstructure, with a maximum grain size of less than 1 micron; a minimum tungsten carbide content of about 80%; a minimum cobalt content of about 10%, and a minimum hardness on the Rockwell A scale of about 91. As stated above, a more preferred tungsten carbide conforms to the International Organization for Standardizations (ISO) standard 513, K20 to K30 tungsten carbides, which require, tungsten carbide content of about 84 to about 90 mass %; cobalt content of 10 to about 16 mass %; a grain size of about 0.6 to about 0.8 microns (i.e. ultra fine to micro fine grade). Further, K20 to K30 tungsten carbide, has a Ra hardness of about 91.4 to about 91.8; transverse rupture strength of about 4 to about 4.3 GPa; fracture toughness of about 7.5 to about 8.7 MPa-mand density of about 13.7 to about 14.5 g\/cm.","As clearly disclosed within U.S. Pat. Nos. 2,731,711, entitled Sintered Tungsten Carbide Composition, issued Jan. 24, 1956 to Lucas; 3,165,822, entitled, Tungsten Carbide Tool Manufacture, issued Jan. 19, 1965 to Beeghly; 3,623,849, entitled, Sintered Refractory Articles of Manufacture, issued Nov. 30, 1971 to Benjamin; 4,684,405, entitled, Sintered Tungsten Carbide Material and Manufacturing Method, issued Aug. 4, 1987 to Kolaska; all incorporated herein by reference\u2014the manufacture of carbide parts is old and well known in the art. Such manufacture is further detailed in the text, Metal Cutting Theory and Practice, 2Ed., pages 146-8, by Stephenson and Agapiou, CRC Press (2006), which provides an example wherein tungsten carbide parts can be manufactured by mixing, compacting, and sintering tungsten-carbon, WC, and cobalt, Co, powders. The Co acts as a binder for the hard WC grains; the grain size and binder content largely determining the parts physical characteristics. This text states that such WC parts exhibit high transverse rupture strength, high compression strength, and high fatigue, good hot hardness, and that carbides conduct heat well. Further, the text states that, by varying the cobalt content, the relative balance of hardness and toughness can be changed.","Data is presented in the following table, Table 1, from a series of test firings of an M249 Short Barrel Machine Gun, using BFAs of the style that is subject to this patent application, with stems of different materials, heat treatments, coatings, and stem tip geometry. The goal was to establish the number of blank rounds that can be fired prior to the particular BFA stem eroding, i.e. eroding to the point where the clearance between the BFA stem and barrel bore increased to cause the level of backpressure to lessen such that the weapon no longer automatically cycled (the life cycle of the particular stem).",{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0063","num":"0062"},"tables":{"@attributes":{"id":"TABLE-US-00001","num":"00001"},"table":{"@attributes":{"frame":"none","colsep":"0","rowsep":"0","pgwide":"1"},"tgroup":[{"@attributes":{"align":"left","colsep":"0","rowsep":"0","cols":"1"},"colspec":{"@attributes":{"colname":"1","colwidth":"294pt","align":"center"}},"thead":{"row":{"entry":"TABLE 1"}},"tbody":{"@attributes":{"valign":"top"},"row":[{"entry":{"@attributes":{"namest":"1","nameend":"1","align":"center","rowsep":"1"}}},{"entry":"Life Cycle, In Blank Rounds Fired, Of Different Stem Materials"}]}},{"@attributes":{"align":"left","colsep":"0","rowsep":"0","cols":"6"},"colspec":[{"@attributes":{"colname":"1","colwidth":"49pt","align":"left"}},{"@attributes":{"colname":"2","colwidth":"42pt","align":"left"}},{"@attributes":{"colname":"3","colwidth":"49pt","align":"left"}},{"@attributes":{"colname":"4","colwidth":"49pt","align":"center"}},{"@attributes":{"colname":"5","colwidth":"49pt","align":"left"}},{"@attributes":{"colname":"6","colwidth":"56pt","align":"center"}}],"tbody":{"@attributes":{"valign":"top"},"row":[{"entry":[{},"Heat Treated",{},{},{},"Number of"]},{"entry":[{},"to Rockwell",{},"Coating",{},"Blank"]},{"entry":["Stem","C Scale","Coating (if","Thickness","Stem End","Rounds to"]},{"entry":["Material","Hardness","any)","(inches)","Geometry","Failure"]},{"entry":{"@attributes":{"namest":"1","nameend":"6","align":"center","rowsep":"1"}}},{"entry":["4340 steel","Rc 28-32","None","N\/A","Flat End with ","200"]},{"entry":[{},{},{},{},"45 degree",{}]},{"entry":[{},{},{},{},"edge bevel",{}]},{"entry":["4340 steel","Rc 28-32","Hard chrome",".0002-.0004","Flat End with ","200"]},{"entry":[{},{},{},{},"45 degree",{}]},{"entry":[{},{},{},{},"edge bevel",{}]},{"entry":["4340 steel","Re 28-32","Hard chrome",".001","Flat End with ","600"]},{"entry":[{},{},{},{},"45 degree",{}]},{"entry":[{},{},{},{},"edge bevel",{}]},{"entry":["4340 steel","Re 50+","Plasmadize",".002","Flat End with ","200"]},{"entry":[{},{},"3121",{},"45 degree",{}]},{"entry":[{},{},{},{},"edge bevel",{}]},{"entry":["4340 steel","Re 50+","Plasmadize",".002","Flat End with ","200"]},{"entry":[{},{},"3131",{},"45 degree",{}]},{"entry":[{},{},{},{},"edge bevel",{}]},{"entry":["4340 steel","Rc 50+","Plasmadize",".002","Flat End with ","200"]},{"entry":[{},{},"3171",{},"45 degree",{}]},{"entry":[{},{},{},{},"edge bevel",{}]},{"entry":["A2 tool steel","Rc 40-50","Hard chrome",".001","Rounded End","200"]},{"entry":["A2 tool steel","Re 40-50","Titanium",".001","Rounded End","200"]},{"entry":[{},{},"nitrate",{},{},{}]},{"entry":["H13 steel","Rc 50+","Hard chrome",".001","Rounded End","400"]},{"entry":["H13 steel","Rc 50+","Hard chrome",".002","Rounded End","800"]},{"entry":["H13 steel","Rc 50+","Hard chrome",".005","Rounded End","200"]},{"entry":["Tungsten","Ra 92","None","N\/A","Flat End with","Over 10,000"]},{"entry":["Carbide","(Note 2)",{},{},"45 degree",{}]},{"entry":[{},{},{},{},"edge bevel"]},{"entry":{"@attributes":{"namest":"1","nameend":"6","align":"center","rowsep":"1"}}},{"entry":"Notes:"},{"entry":"1.
