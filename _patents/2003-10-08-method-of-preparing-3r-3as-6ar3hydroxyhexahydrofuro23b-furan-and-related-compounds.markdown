No. 60\/417,379, filed Oct. 9, 2002.","The subject matter of this application has been supported in part by research Grant No. GM53386 from the National Institutes for Health (NIH), Bethesda, Md.","The present invention is directed to methods of preparing (3R, 3aS, 6aR)-3-hydroxyhexahydrofuro[2,3-b]furan, having a structural formula (I), stereoisomers of (I), and compounds structurally related to (I). \n\n","The present invention also is directed to a method of preparing (5S)-5-(benzyloxymethyl)-5H-furan-2-one having a structure \n\n","Significant advances have been made in the design and synthesis of nonpeptidal ligands for the HIV protease substrate binding site. See, S. Thaisrivong, 29, p. 133 (1994). The structure-based design of bis-tetrahydrofuran ligands that can effectively replace two amide bonds and a 10n-aromatic system of an HIV protease inhibitor has been reported (A. K. Ghosh et al., 37, p. 2506 (1994)).","The present commercial method of synthesizing the compound of structural formula (I) provides a racemic mixture, which requires enzymatic resolution to provide optically active ligands with high enantiomeric excess. The preparation of a racemic mixture, and subsequent resolution to provide compound (I), significantly reduces the yield of the desired enantiomer because about one-half of the racemic mixture, i.e., the undesired enantiomer, is wasted. In addition, costs are increased because about one-half of the starting materials and reagents used in the synthesis are wasted.","In particular, the following synthetic scheme (1) illustrates the present commercial method of synthesizing compound (I). This synthesis is disclosed in detail in A. K. Ghosh et al., 36(4), pp. 505-508 (1995), incorporated herein by reference. Also see, A. K. Ghosh et al., 39, pp. 3278-3290 (1996) for the synthesis of compound (I) and a related compound of structural formula (II) (i.e., (3S,3aR,7aS)-3-hydroxyhexahydrofuro[2,3-b]pyran). \n\n\n","There is a need in the art to provide an improved method of synthesizing compound (I), stereoisomers of (I), and related compounds, like compound (II). In particular, a need exists for a short synthetic route that avoids generation of a racemic mixture, and, therefore, increases yield of the desired enantiomer and decreases costs.","There also is a need in the art for an improved synthesis of precursors to compound (I), for example (5S)-5-(benzyloxymethyl)-5H-furan-2-one.","The present invention relates to methods of preparing (3R,3aS,6aR)-3-hydroxyhexahydrofuro-[2,3-b]furan and related compounds, and to a method of preparing a precursor to compound (I). In particular, the present invention relates to a stereoselective method preparing a compound of structural formula (I), stereoisomers of (I), and related compounds, like the compound of structural formula (II). The present method overcomes disadvantages associated with the present-day commercial synthesis of compound (I), e.g., eliminates the enzymatic resolution of a racemic mixture and increases the yield of the desired enantiomer. The present invention also provides a method of preparing a precursor to compound (I) in high stereoselective yield.","In particular, the present invention is directed to a new and convenient synthesis of (3R,3aS,6aR)-3-hydroxyhexahydrofuro[2,3-b]furan, also termed bis-THF and compound (I), which is an important ligand for several highly potent HIV protease inhibitors, including \n\n\nThe method disclosed herein is a new and economical synthesis of an important Pligand, i.e., bis-THF, and ligands related in structure to bis-THF. Incorporation of bis-THF in various dipeptide isosteres, including (R)-(hydroxyethyl)aminosulfonamide isosteres, resulted in enhanced potency against wild-type HIV protease, and also against numerous mutant proteases isolated from drug-resistant HIV. The present method also allows (a) synthesis of stereoisomers of bis-THF, (b) incorporation of substituents onto the bis-THF ring system, and (c) variation of ring sizes to optimize HIV protease inhibitor properties, including in vitro potency, in vivo potency, and oral bioavailability.\n","The present method of synthesizing bis-THF is summarized as follows: \n\n","Another aspect of the present invention is to provide a method of preparing a compound having a structure \n\n\nthen utilizing the benzyl-protected 5-hydroxymethyl-5H-furan-2-one in the synthesis of compound (I).\n","Another aspect of the present invention is to provide a method of preparing compounds related to bis-THF by using a starting material having a following structure: \n\n","wherein X and Y, independently, are selected from the group consisting of O, S, and NR; each R, independently, is selected from the group consisting of hydro, Calkyl, aryl, Calkoxy, Calkylenearyl; and n is 1, 2, or 3.","Another aspect of the present invention is to provide a method of synthesizing various stereoisomers of bis-THF and compounds related to bis-THF in high stereospecific yield.","In addition, the present invention is directed to methods of preparing protected (5R)-hydroxymethyl-5H-furan-2-ones, such as (5S)-5-(benzyloxymethyl)-5H-furan-2-one.","These and other novel aspects and advantages of the present invention will become apparent from the following detailed description of the preferred embodiments.","The present invention is directed to an efficient, enantioselective synthesis of (3R,3aS,6aR)-3-hydroxyhexahydrofuro[2,3-b]furan (i.e., compound (I) or bis-THF), which is a ligand used in the synthesis of several potent HIV protease inhibitors. For example, compound (III) is currently in clinical trials and contains bis-THF as the Pligand. The bis-THF ligand also can be utilized as a component of other therapeutic compounds. The present invention further is directed to methods of synthesizing stereoisomers of bis-THF and synthesizing bicyclic ligands related in structure to bis-THF in high stereospecific yield.","In addition, the present invention is directed to methods of preparing protected (5R)-hydroxymethyl-5H-furan-2-ones, such as (5S)-5-(benzyloxymethyl)-5H-furan-2-one.","The present-day synthesis of bis-THF involves four steps, and yields bis-THF in racemic form. An enzymatic optical resolution of the racemic product provides the desired biologically more active ligand (i.e., bis-THF). The other, less biologically active enantiomer has little value. Thus, the overall synthesis of bis-THF is inefficient. The present synthetic route produces a single, optically pure enantiomer. The present synthetic route also utilizes readily available starting materials, as well as a very efficient, high yield photochemical step.","The present disclosure focuses on the synthetic route to provide bis-THF. However, as disclosed hereafter, substituting a different heterocyclic starting material for 1,3-dioxolane yields compounds related to bis-THF, stereoselectively and in good yield, using the identical synthetic route. The compounds related to bis-THF also can be used as ligands in pharmaceutical compounds, like HIV protease inhibitors. In addition, stereoisomers of bis-THF can be prepared by starting with a different enantiomer of hydroxymethyl-5H-furan-2-one.","The following abbreviations are used in this specification: CHCl(methylene chloride), NaBH(sodium borohydride), EtOH (ethanol), MeOH (methanol), MeS (dimethyl sulfide), h (hour), Ac (acetyl), AcO (acetic anhydride), DME (dimethoxyethane), LiOH (lithium hydroxide), EtN (trimethylamine), MeLi (methyl lithium), THF (tetrahydrofuran), PG (protecting group), hv (light), LiAlH(lithium aluminum hydride), EtO (diethyl ether), HO (water), TPAP (tetrapropylammonium perruthenate), MNO (4-methylmorpholine-N-oxide), min (minute), RT (room temperature), MS (molecular sieve), t-Bu (tertiary butyl), NaSO(sodium sulfate), CHCl(chloroform), CDCl(deuterated chloroform), NaHCO(sodium bicarbonate), Ph (phenyl), g (gram), and NHCl (ammonium chloride).","The synthesis of bis-THF (compound (I)) is summarized below: \n\n","The starting material for the present synthetic route to compound (I) is (5S)-hydroxymethyl-5H-furan-2-one (1). In the first step of the synthesis, the hydroxy group of compound (1) optionally is protected by reacting compound (1) with compound capable of positioning a protecting group (PG) at the hydroxy position of compound (1). This step can be eliminated, and compound (1) can be converted directly to an unprotected compound (3), e.g., PG is H. In some embodiments, use of a PG compound is preferred because subsequent reaction products are easier to isolate.","Protecting group (PG) compounds are utilized in accordance with general principles of synthetic organic chemistry.

An important intermediate, i.e., racemic allylic alcohol (8), was prepared in multigram quantities by treatment of commercially available benzyloxyacetaldehyde (7) with vinylmagnesium bromide in THF at 0\u00b0 C. for 1 hour. Enzymatic acylation of the racemic alcohol (8) with immobilized lipase PS-30 (25% by weight with respect to lipase PS-30) in the presence of isopropenyl acetate in dimethoxyethane (DME) at 23\u00b0 C. for 23 hours provided the best yield. These conditions provided the optically active desired enantiomer (9) (43% yield, >99% ee) and the acylated alcohol 10 (54% yield), which were separated by silica gel chromatography as set forth in the following synthetic scheme. The optical purity of compound (9) was determined by formation of the Mosher ester and F-NMR analysis (J. A. Dale et al., 34, 2543 (1969)). A control experiment without the enzyme proved that the nonenzymatic reaction was extremely slow (i.e., only trace amount of acylated product was formed after 48 hours at 23\u00b0 C.). The acetate (10) can be readily converted to 2-(S)-1-benzyloxy-but-3-en-2-ol (9) using a three-step sequence including: (1) saponification of compound (10) with KCOin MeOH at 23\u00b0 C. for 35 minutes to provide (R)-1-benzyloxy-but-3-en-2-ol (11); (2) Mitsunobu inversion (S. F. Martin et al., 32, 3017 (1991) and O. Mitsunobu, (1981)) of the resulting 2-(R)-alcohol with PhP, p-NO-benzoic acid in the presence of diisopropylazodicarboxylate (DIAD) at 23\u00b0 C. for 40 minutes; and (3) aqueous lithium hydroxide promoted saponification of the resulting benzoate derivative. The (S)-alcohol (9) thus obtained (87% overall in 3 steps) has high optical purity (>96% ee) after formation of the Mosher ester and F-NMR analysis. The absolute configurations of the resolved alcohols were assigned based upon comparison of optical rotation with the literature data (A. V. Rao et al., 26, 2497-6500 (1987)).","Optically active allylic alcohol (9) was converted to acrylate ester (12) by reaction with acryloyl chloride and EtN in CHClat 0\u00b0 C. for 10 minutes. Acrylate ester (12) was isolated in 92% yield after silica gel chromatography. Olefin metathesis of (12) with commercially available Grubbs' second generation catalyst (Cl(PCy) (IMes)Ru=CHPh, 4 mol %) in refluxing CHClfor 5 hours, provided the \u03b1,\u03b2-unsaturated \u03b3-lactone (13) in 98% yield (R. H. Grubbs et al., 54, 4413 (1998)).","Irradiation of compound (13) in the presence of 1,3-dioxolane and a catalytic amount of benzophenone using 450 watt mercury lamp for 9 hours provided dioxolane derivative (14) in 82% yield. Catalytic hydrogenation of compound (14) over 10% Pd\u2014C in MeOH afforded alcohol (15) in 89% yield. Reduction of compound (15) with lithium aluminum hydride followed by acid catalyzed cyclization furnished bis-tetrahydrofuran derivative (5) in 77% yield in 2-steps. TPAP oxidation of compound (5) provided compound (6) which was reduced with sodium borohydride (NaBH) to provide optically active bis-tetrahydrofuranyl alcohol (I) as described previously. \n\n","Epimeric alcohol (5) also was converted to desired bis-THF (I) using a two-step sequence involving: (1) Mitsunobu inversion of compound (5) using triphenylphosphine (PhP) and p-nitrobenzoic acid in the presence of diisopropylazodicarboxylate and (2) aqueous lithium hydroxide promoted saponification of the resulting benzoate derivative to provide bis-THF (I).","Experimentals:","1-(Benzyloxy)-but-3-en-2-ol (\u00b1)-(8): To a solution of vinylmagnesium bromide (1 M in THF, 40 mL, 40 mmol) in THF (10 mL) at 0\u00b0 C. was added benzyloxyacetaldehyde (7) (5 g, 33.3 mmol) dropwise.
