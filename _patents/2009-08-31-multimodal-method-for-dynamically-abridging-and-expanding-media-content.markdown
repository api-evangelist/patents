title: Multi-modal method for dynamically abridging and expanding media content
abstract: Systems and methods are presented for viewing video content while dynamically switching between multiple viewing modes that present the video content at different levels of abridgment. While video content is playing in one viewing mode, input may be received to play the video content in another viewing mode. One of the viewing modes may present the video content in a more condensed form than the other viewing mode does, so that when switching from one viewing mode to another viewing mode, a more abridged or less abridged version of the video content may be presented. One of the viewing modes may be a full presentation mode that shows a complete, unabridged version of the video content, while the other of the viewing modes may play a condensed version of the video content.

{"@attributes":{"id":"description"},"BRFSUM":[{},{}],"heading":["BACKGROUND","SUMMARY","DETAILED DESCRIPTION OF EMBODIMENTS"],"p":["Today people can watch all kinds of video productions like movies, television serials, sports series, lecture series, news programming, and the like on computers, mobile devices, video consoles, televisions, or other viewing apparatus. It is no longer necessary to view video content according to a fixed schedule set by a broadcaster or theater or other agency. Now viewers can choose where and when they want to see media productions.","The supply of video content is so vast that surveying the available stock and choosing what to watch can be an arduous task. Looking through a series of episodes to locate a remembered scene may be similarly burdensome. If one wants to survey even a single television series, looking for a remembered theme, or for some particularly interesting part, one may be forced to scan through a whole sequence of episodes or of synopses of those episodes in a tedious, linear fashion.","Various embodiments of systems and methods for receiving input to play video content in an abridging mode are disclosed, where the abridging mode presents an abridged version of the video content. In response to receiving input to play video content in an abridging mode, the video content is played in the abridging mode. While playing the video content in the abridging mode, and in response to receiving input to switch from the abridging mode to an expanding mode, playing of the video content switches from the abridging mode to the expanding mode. The expanding mode presents a longer and more detailed version of the video content than the abridging mode does.","While video content is being played in the expanding mode, input may be received to switch to the abridging mode, so that playing of the video content switches from the expanding to the abridging mode. In some embodiments, there may be more than two modes for playing video content, where for each pair of the playing modes, one of the pair presents a more abbreviated version of the video content than the other of the pair of modes does. Given such a pair of playing modes A and B, then in response to receiving input to switch from playing mode A to playing mode B, and based upon a location within the video content currently playing in mode A, a corresponding portion of the video content to be played in mode B is determined. Some embodiments may include a full presentation mode that presents a full, unabridged, complete version of the video content. According to various embodiments, indicators may show which mode is the current playing mode. For some embodiments, the video content being played may include several video presentations, and a signal may indicate when playing transitions from one of the several video presentations to another of the video presentations.","Some embodiments may also provide a timeline interface that displays a representation of video presentations scheduled for playing. Such a timeline interface may expand or contract portions of the representation of the video presentations in response to a change from one playing mode to another. For example, if a portion of the content that is playing in one mode will take less time to play in another mode, then its timeline representation may contract when playing switches to the other mode. Conversely, its timeline representation may expand if more time is needed to play the portion of content in the other mode. Representations of other portions of the video presentations may correspondingly be adjusted by expanding or contracting.","In certain embodiments, a memory is coupled to a processor, and the memory stores program instructions executable by the processor to implement a video playing module. In these embodiments, the functions described above may be performed by the video playing module. In some embodiments, the system may include a computer-readable storage medium storing program instructions that are computer-executable to perform these functions.","While the present disclosure is described herein by way of example for several embodiments and illustrative drawings, those skilled in the art will recognize that the disclosure is not limited to the embodiments or drawings described. It should be understood, that the drawings and detailed description thereto are not intended to limit the claims to the particular form disclosed, but on the contrary, the intention is to cover modifications, equivalents and alternatives falling within the spirit and scope of the present disclosure as defined by the appended claims. The headings used herein are for organizational purposes only and are not meant to be used to limit the scope of the description or the claims. As used throughout this application, the word \u201cmay\u201d is used in a permissive sense (i.e., meaning having the potential to), rather than the mandatory sense (i.e., meaning must). Similarly, the words \u201cinclude,\u201d \u201cincluding,\u201d and \u201cincludes\u201d mean including, but not limited to.","In the following detailed description, numerous specific details are set forth to provide a thorough understanding of claimed subject matter. However, it will be understood by those skilled in the art that claimed subject matter may be practiced without these specific details. In other instances, methods, apparatuses or systems that would be known by one of ordinary skill have not been described in detail so as not to obscure claimed subject matter.","Some portions of the following detailed description are presented in terms of algorithms or symbolic representations of operations on binary digital signals stored within a memory of a specific apparatus or special purpose computing device or platform. In the context of this particular specification, the term specific apparatus or the like includes a general purpose computer once it is programmed to perform particular functions pursuant to instructions from program software. Algorithmic descriptions or symbolic representations are examples of techniques used by those of ordinary skill in the signal processing or related arts to convey the substance of their work to others skilled in the art. An algorithm is here, and is generally, considered to be a self-consistent sequence of operations or similar signal processing leading to a desired result. In this context, operations or processing involve physical manipulation of physical quantities. Typically, although not necessarily, such quantities may take the form of electrical or magnetic signals capable of being stored, transferred, combined, compared or otherwise manipulated. It has proven convenient at times, principally for reasons of common usage, to refer to such signals as bits, data, values, elements, symbols, characters, terms, numbers, numerals or the like. It should be understood, however, that all of these or similar terms are to be associated with appropriate physical quantities and are merely convenient labels. Unless specifically stated otherwise, as apparent from the following discussion, it is appreciated that throughout this specification discussions utilizing terms such as \u201cprocessing,\u201d \u201ccomputing,\u201d \u201ccalculating,\u201d \u201cdetermining\u201d or the like refer to actions or processes of a specific apparatus, such as a special purpose computer or a similar special purpose electronic computing device. In the context of this specification, therefore, a special purpose computer or a similar special purpose electronic computing device is capable of manipulating or transforming signals, typically represented as physical electronic or magnetic quantities within memories, registers, or other information storage devices, transmission devices, or display devices of the special purpose computer or similar special purpose electronic computing device.","Introduction","As noted above, sifting through a series of video episodes, or even one long video production in order to locate compelling or sought-after portions can be a burdensome activity. Relief from such monotonous linear processing of large amounts of video material may be found in an approach that allows one to dynamically shift back and forth between viewing abridged segments and viewing more expanded, fuller segments of related media material. Just as it is helpful to leaf through a book by switching between reading multi-chapter section descriptions, chapter descriptions, and portions of actual text within a chapter, so can it be very useful to traverse a large video offering by freely moving at will, back and forth between synopsis and detail. One would wish, when looking through a series of synopses of episodes, to be able to \u201cdrill down\u201d and immediately switch to watching a more detailed version of a part found while scanning a synopsis, and, if the more detailed version appears promising, to switch to an even more complete corresponding version. One would also want to be able, just as readily, to escape from viewing a relatively complete version of an episode, and to return to a more synoptic mode. A capacity for alternating back and forth between more synoptic and more extensive viewing levels for substantial quantities of viewing matter would be most advantageous.","In the following discussion, various embodiments of systems and methods for dynamically switching between viewing an abridgement and viewing a relatively fuller presentation of video material are explored. There are detailed descriptions of modes which present video material in varying degrees of completeness, from abridging modes giving that give compact synopses, to expanding modes that offer longer versions of the same material, or even a full, complete version of the material. There is a discussion of switching from one mode to another while watching the video content. A timeline interface offering a representation of an assembly of several video presentations is explained in detail. Throughout the discussion, the terms \u201cviewing mode\u201d and \u201cplaying mode\u201d are used interchangeably.","Dynamically Abridging and Expanding Video Content while it Plays","In , video display  is shown with an abridged version of video content  playing upon it. The playing of video content  on video display  may be monitored or controlled on a timeline interface such as the illustrated sample timeline interface  shown beneath video display . The appearance and functioning of timeline interface  may vary according to the embodiments. In certain embodiments, timeline interface  may appear on video display  itself, or in some other location. Timeline interface  may, in some instances, be implemented so that it appears on a video output device, such as a video device that includes video display . Alternatively, a video device hosting timeline interface  may not be the same video device that includes video display . Timeline interface  may, according to some embodiments, be implemented on a separate hardware device such as a remote control, where portions of timeline interface  are permanently represented on the hardware device, even when the device is turned off. For example, symbols indicating pause, play, zoom, seek, audio amplification, or some other function may be etched into the device itself, while other components of timeline interface  may be designed to operate only when the device is turned on. Timeline interface  may, according to some embodiments, be partially or completely invisible during some of the time video content  is playing. For example, in some implementations, timeline interface  may be configured to be summoned or dismissed at various points during the time video content  is playing.","Various components of timeline interface  shown in  may exist separately, or they may be implemented in combination, according to distinct embodiments. The particular structure and functioning depicted in timeline interface  provides but one example of an architecture for timeline interface . Other designs for timeline interface  may be constructed according to particular requirements of various other embodiments, and may include some of the elements present in , but exclude other of those elements, while incorporating elements not included in the embodiment shown in .","Timeline interface  may, according to many embodiments, be a dynamic mechanism that is actively responsive to the playing of video content, providing various indications to a user regarding the playing of viewable content. It may also provide means for a user to control the playing of video material. These operational aspects of timeline interface  are explained below.","It is contemplated that, in some embodiments, a multi-modal method for dynamically abridging and expanding video content while it is playing may be implemented without resorting to a timeline interface, and that a different interface or control mechanism may be implemented to allow a person watching video content to freely switch between viewing modes \u201con the fly\u201d while the video content is playing.","The example timeline interface  is depicted in  as having a timeline bar  that provides a representation of several video presentations. For example, in the illustrated embodiment, timeline bar  has five contiguous segments, each one representing a video presentation scheduled for playing. According to embodiments, the several video presentations represented on timeline bar  may be automatically played in a given sequential order. In some implementations, the video presentations scheduled for playing may play completely through in a given order until all of the video presentations have been played, without ever changing viewing modes. In such embodiments, switching from one viewing mode to another viewing mode may require additional input. Additional input to switch from one viewing mode to another may be provided a human user, in some instances. In other instances, input to switch viewing modes may be generated programmatically, without requiring user action. In certain cases, input to switch viewing modes may be embedded within video presentations themselves, or within configuration files governing the playing of the video presentations.","Timeline bar  may represent any number of video representations, according to embodiments. The five segments of timeline bar  are labeled in  using the numerals  through , but such labeling is optional. In other instances, segments or other components of timeline interface  representing video presentations may not be labeled, or may be identified in some other manner. Similarly, the four graduations shown on timeline bar  to mark boundaries between video presentation representations may or may not be implemented as visible markers, depending on the requirements of the embodiments. Representation of video presentations on timeline bar  may be dynamic. For example, modal changes for playing the video presentations may require substituting one mode-based version of a video representation for another mode-based version of the video representation; if the two versions have different lengths, then timeline bar  may adjust itself to reflect the different lengths, and it may make other adjustments to reflect a change in the playing status of the video presentations.","Progress bar  may indicate video material that has already been played. For example, in the embodiment shown in , progress bar  shades the first segment and part of the second segment of timeline bar , indicating that the video presentation represented by the first segment has already played, and that a part of the video presentation represented by the second segment has already played. Area  of timeline bar , which is the portion of timeline bar  not indicated by progress bar , may denote video content which is scheduled for playing, but which has not yet been played. As playing of the video presentations progresses, progress bar  may lengthen to indicate the growing proportion of material that has already played, while area  correspondingly may shrink, to indicate the diminishing proportion of video content which has not yet been played. Marker  may indicate the current location within the currently-playing video presentation.","Indicator  may serve a variety of purposes, and it may serve several purposes simultaneously, according to various embodiments. In the particular embodiment illustrated in , indicator  may serve at least four distinct purposes, as described in the following paragraphs.","First, the location of indicator  may mark the beginning of a currently-playing video presentation represented on timeline bar .  shows the second of the video presentations as the one currently-playing. In some embodiments, a different marker for the beginning of a video segment may be implemented, and element  may not appear at the beginning of a video segment. For example the division between the end of the first presentation and the beginning of the second presentation may also be indicated by a vertical graduation, like the one shown inside progress bar  above indicator . According to other embodiments, the beginning of a currently-playing video segment may not be indicated with a special-purpose marker.","Second, indicator  may serve as a mode symbol, signifying that the currently-playing video presentation, in this instance the second of the five video presentations represented on timeline bar , is being played in the abridging mode. In the particular implementation illustrated in , indicator  signals that the second of the five video presentations represented on timeline bar  is being played in the abridging mode by appearing as a plus sign. To indicate playing in the expanding mode, indicator  may appear as a minus sign, as shown in . Indicator  may also appear alternately as either a dark or a light disc, as in the embodiment illustrated in , to signal switching between viewing modes. Indicator  may also function together with other indicators when a multiplicity of viewing modes is available. For example, in the embodiment illustrated in , element  and element  operate jointly to indicate operation in three different viewing modes. Such operation is discussed below in the description of . According to some embodiments, an indication of a viewing mode for currently-playing video material may be provided by other means.","Third, indicator  may function as an interactive interface element for timeline interface  for switching between viewing modes. In the particular embodiment illustrated in , a user may click on indicator  while it appears as a plus sign in order to switch from an abridging viewing mode to an expanding viewing mode. When a user clicks on the plus sign shown in , the currently-playing video presentation will switch from playing in an abridging mode to playing in an expanding mode, and indicator  will change into a minus sign, as shown in . The minus sign of  signifies that the currently-playing video presentation is playing in an expanding mode. Should the user click on the minus sign form of element  shown in , then the currently-playing video presentation will switch from playing in an expanding mode to playing in an abridging mode, and element  will change back into a plus sign, as shown in . Other structures for switching among a multiplicity of viewing modes may be implemented in some embodiments. For example, in the embodiment illustrated in , there are two distinct elements  and  which operate jointly to allow operating in any of three different viewing modes, as discussed below. Element  may not be interactive in some embodiments, and input for switching among modes may be facilitated in some other manner. For example, in some embodiments, a user may press a combination of keys on a keyboard, or press a button on a hardware device, to switch from one viewing mode to another.","Fourth, indicator  may signal a transition from one video presentation to another video presentation. For example, although it is not shown in , element  may appear in one of two alternating colors, changing from one color to the other color as playing progresses from one presentation to the next. In the embodiment illustrated in , a short horizontal bar toggles between two positions at indicator  to indicate passage from one video episode to another, and a short vertical bar toggles left and right at indicator  whenever there is a transition from one subdivision of an episode to another subdivision of an episode. Alternatively, for the embodiment illustrated in , four different colors may be used to indicate such transitions, where indicator  alternates between two of the four colors, and indicator  alternates between the other two of the four colors.","It is not necessary that all four purposes be managed with a single element. In other embodiments, the four purposes may be separately served using separate elements.",{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0033","num":"0032"},"figref":"FIG. 1C"},"The abridging mode illustrated in  presents an abridged version of video content. The expanding mode presents a longer and more detailed version of the video content than the abridging mode does, but the expanding mode still does not present a full, complete, unabridged version of the video content. The full presentation mode shows a full, complete, unabridged version of the video content. Thus, the three modes illustrated in  offer three different levels of granularity, with the abridging mode giving the most abridged version of the video content, the expanding mode giving a fuller, but not complete version of the video content, and the full presentation mode giving the full, complete, unabridged version of the video content.",{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0035","num":"0034"},"figref":["FIG. 1C","FIG. 1C"],"b":["170","100","110","120","130","140","120","120","130"]},"In snapshot A, the location of indicator  may mark the beginning of a second episode of the video presentations represented on timeline bar . The division between the end of the first episode and the beginning of the second episode may be further indicated by the vertical graduation shown inside progress bar  above indicator . In this example embodiment, indicator  of snapshot A may also denote that the currently-playing episode, in this instance the second episode, is being played in the abridging mode. Length bar  may represent the length of the currently-playing episode, which is the second episode, while it is playing in the abridging mode. Note that progress bar  overlaps length bar , and that the overlap indicates the portion of the currently-playing episode that has already been played.","In snapshot B, taken at a later time than snapshot A, indicator  may mark the beginning of a third episode of the video presentations represented on timeline bar . The division between the end of the second episode and the beginning of the third episode may be further indicated by a second vertical graduation shown inside progress bar . Indicator  of snapshot B may also denote that the currently-playing episode, the third episode, is being played in the abridging mode. Length bar  may represent the length of the currently-playing episode, which is the third episode, while it is playing in the abridging mode. Note that progress bar  overlaps length bar , and that the overlap indicates the portion of the currently-playing third episode that has already played.","In snapshot A, there is a short horizontal bar above indicator , and in snapshot B, there is a short horizontal bar below indicator . The horizontal bar is designed to toggle between the two positions whenever there is a transition from one episode to another, or from one subdivision of an episode to another subdivision of an episode. It is not necessary that the transition be indicated by a horizontal bar. Other means for indicating transitions may be implemented for other embodiments. For example, a change in color may be used to signal a transition from one episode to another, or from one subdivision of an episode to another subdivision of an episode.","In the embodiment illustrated in , input to switch between the abridging mode and the expanding mode may be generated by clicking on indicator . Snapshot C depicts timeline interface  after someone has clicked indicator  of snapshot B. In snapshot C, indicator  has changed form, from the black disc shown in snapshot B to the white disc shown in snapshot C. This change may indicate that the currently-playing episode, which is the third episode, is now being shown on video display  in the expanding mode rather than in the abridging mode. The location of indicator  may also mark the beginning of the third episode of the video presentations represented on timeline bar . Notice that length bar  is longer in snapshot C than it is in snapshot B: in snapshot C, length bar  represents the length of the currently-playing episode, which is the third episode, while playing in the expanding mode. Because the expanding-mode version of the third episode is longer than the abridging-mode version of the third episode, length bar  is correspondingly longer in snapshot C than it is in snapshot B.","The short horizontal bar underneath indicator  in snapshot B remains underneath indicator  in snapshot C because there is no transition of episodes; in both snapshots, the third episode is the currently-playing episode. The portions of timeline bar  that do not represent the third episode may shorten in moving from snapshot B to snapshot C in order to accommodate the longer, expanding-mode version of the third episode.","In snapshot D, an indicator  appears to the right of indicator . In this instance, second indicator  may mark the beginning of the currently-playing subdivision of the currently-playing episode, namely the second subdivision of the third episode. In the embodiment illustrated in , the expanding-mode version of an episode may contain several subdivisions. Notice that the portion of timeline bar  that lies between indicators  and , i.e., between the two graduations shown inside progress bar  above indicators  and , is a representation of the first subdivision of the third episode, which has already played, as may be indicated by progress bar . In this example embodiment, indicator  of snapshot D may also denote that the currently-playing subdivision of the currently-playing episode, the second subdivision of the third episode, is being played in the same mode as indicated by indicator , namely the expanding mode. Length bar  may shorten in moving from snapshot C to snapshot D because, in snapshot D, length bar  may represent the length of the currently-playing subdivision of the currently-playing episode, rather than the length of the currently-playing episode, as it does in snapshot C. The presence of indicator  may signal to the person watching video display  that a particular subdivision of the currently-playing episode is being played, and length bar  may correspondingly shorten so that it represents only the length of the currently-playing subdivision of the currently-playing episode, as in snapshot D, rather than the length of the entire currently-playing episode. In snapshot D, the currently-playing subdivision is the second subdivision of the third episode. Element  of snapshot D indicates that the third episode continues playing in the expanding mode, while element  signals that the second subdivision of the third episode remains playing in the expanding mode. Element  offers the user the opportunity to switch from viewing a subdivision of the third episode in the expanding mode to viewing the subdivision in the full presentation mode.","In snapshot E, indicator  may mark the beginning of the currently-playing subdivision of the currently-playing episode, namely the third subdivision of the third episode. The portion of timeline bar  that lies between indicators  and , i.e., between the two graduations shown inside progress bar  above indicators  and , is a representation of the first and second subdivisions of the third episode, which have already played, as may be indicated by progress bar . Indicator  may also denote that the currently-playing subdivision of the currently-playing episode, the third subdivision of the third episode, is being played in the same mode as indicated by element , namely the expanding mode. Length bar  may represent the length of the currently-playing subdivision of the currently-playing episode, namely the third subdivision of the third episode, while it is playing in the expanding mode. Note that progress bar  and length bar  do not overlap in snapshot E, indicating that the third subdivision of the third episode is just beginning to play.","In snapshot D, there is a short vertical bar right of indicator , and in snapshot E, there is a short vertical bar left of indicator . The vertical bar is designed to toggle between the two positions whenever there is a transition from one subdivision of an episode to another subdivision of an episode. It is not necessary that the transition be indicated by a vertical bar. Other means for indicating transitions may be implemented for other embodiments. For example, a change in color may be used to signal a transition from one subdivision of an episode to another subdivision of an episode.","In the embodiment illustrated in , input to switch between the expanding mode and the full presentation mode may be generated by clicking on indicator . Snapshot F depicts timeline interface  after someone has clicked indicator  of snapshot E. In snapshot F, indicator  has changed form from the black disc shown in snapshot E to the white disc shown in snapshot F. This change may indicate that the currently-playing subdivision of the currently-playing episode, namely the third subdivision of the third episode, is now being shown on video display  in a viewing mode that is more detailed than the viewing mode indicated by element , that is, in the full presentation mode rather than in the expanding mode. In snapshot F, the location of indicator  may also mark the beginning of the currently-playing subdivision of the currently-playing episode, namely the third subdivision of the third episode of the video presentations represented on timeline bar . The portion of timeline bar  that lies between indicators  and , i.e., between the two graduations shown inside progress bar  above indicators  and , is a representation of the first and second subdivisions of the third episode, which have already played, as may be indicated by progress bar . Notice that length bar  is longer in snapshot F than it is in snapshot E: in snapshot F, length bar  represents the length of the currently-playing subdivision of the currently-playing episode, namely the third subdivision of the third episode, when playing in full presentation mode. Because the full-presentation-mode version of the third subdivision of the third episode is longer than the expanding-mode version of the third subdivision of the third episode, length bar  is correspondingly longer in snapshot F than it is in snapshot E. Note that progress bar  and length bar  do not overlap in snapshot F, indicating that the third subdivision of the third episode is just beginning to play; in this instance, the playing is in the full presentation mode. Snapshot F shows an instance in which a user has \u201cdrilled down\u201d two levels while viewing video material. First, the user chose to switch from watching the abridging-mode version of the third episode to watching the expanding-mode version of the third episode [snapshot B->snapshot C]. Then, while watching the third subdivision of the third episode in the expanding mode [snapshot E], the user chose to switch to the full presentation mode [snapshot F].","The short vertical bar left of indicator  in snapshot E remains left of indicator  in snapshot F because there is no transition of subdivisions; in both snapshots, the third subdivision of the third episode is the currently-playing subdivision of the currently-playing episode. The portions of timeline bar  that do not represent the third subdivision of the third episode may shorten in moving from snapshot E to snapshot F in order to accommodate the full-presentation-mode version of the third subdivision of the third episode.","It is not necessary that the indication of a location on timeline bar  and the indication of a playing mode be incorporated within a single symbol like indicator  or . In some embodiments, there may be separate indications given to denote a location on timeline bar , and to denote a playing mode. Neither is it necessary that indicator  or  take the form of a disc. In other embodiments, indicator  or  may be implemented in different forms. It is not necessary that input to switch between viewing modes be generated by clicking on indicator  or . According to other embodiments, input to switch between viewing modes may be generated by other means. For example, mode changes may be signaled by pressing a key on a keyboard, or by any number of other conventional means for generating a signal, according to numerous embodiments. Timeline bar , progress bar , and length bar  may also take a variety of forms other than the ones shown in , according to various embodiments. Furthermore, in the embodiment illustrated in , the vertical graduations shown inside progress bar  serve explanatory purposes, and may not necessarily appear in actual implementations. According to various embodiments, progress bar  or length bar  may not appear as visible indicators.",{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0047","num":"0046"},"figref":["FIG. 2","FIGS. 1A-1C","FIG. 2"],"b":["25","25","100","25"]},"Generally speaking, computer system  may correspond to any suitable type of computer system configured to execute applications.

Video playing module  may be configured to receive input to play video content in any of several different modes for playing video content. For example, as illustrated in , video playing module  may furnish a timeline interface  that includes a clickable control element  used to signal video playing module  that it should switch from one playing mode to another playing mode. In other embodiments, other types of interface control elements may be deployed for signaling video playing module  that video material  should be switched to a particular playing mode. In certain embodiments, a keystroke or combination of keystrokes may be used to signal switches from one playing mode to another. According to numerous embodiments, virtually any conventional method of input may be used to notify video playing mode  to switch from one playing mode to another.","Input to invoke a particular playing mode may be provided manually by a human user, or may be generated automatically according to preset criteria. For example, cues recognizable by video playing module  may be embedded in video material  to trigger automatic switches from one playing mode to another. For another example, a configuration file that governs the manner in which video material  is played may inform video playing module  that it ought to switch from playing video material  in one mode to playing video material  in a different mode.","In still other embodiments, a program may be implemented to automate switches in playing mode based upon certain criteria. For example, a program may be generated to initiate automatic switches between playing modes for playable video data captured by an observational apparatus like a recording telescope. In some such instances, criteria determining playing mode switches may be tied to characteristics or attributes of the content of the captured playable video data. For instance, a significant change in brightness or shape or velocity represented by captured video data may be programmed to trigger an automatic change in playing mode, or to generate a message asking a user whether playing of video material  should switch from one mode to another.","According to numerous embodiments, a variety of criteria may be used to automatically determine potential playing-mode changes set to occur at certain points during the playing of video material . Such determinations may involve calculating positions within video material  at which a switch in playing mode may be desirable, and may also include finding playing modes that are compatible with the calculated positions. For example, a position may be found within video material  corresponding to a sudden alteration in dynamic characteristics of video material ; in such an instance, it may be desirable to switch from an abridging mode, which presents an abridged version of video material , to an expanding mode that presents a longer and more detailed version of the segment of video material  showing altered dynamic characteristics. Conversely, detection of a more static phase within video material  may generate a signal to switch from an expanding mode, which presents a relatively longer and more detailed version of that phase, to an abridging mode, which presents a more abridged version of that phase of video material . In general, video playing module  may be implemented to facilitate modal switching initiated by both human users and by automated means.","The number of available playing modes may vary according to diverse embodiments of video playing module . In some cases, there may be only two available modes for playing video material , where one of the modes presents a more abbreviated version of video material  than the other mode does. The mode presenting the more abridged version of video material  may be designated as an abridging mode in relation to the other mode, which may be termed an expanding mode, relative to the abridging mode. According to some embodiments, both the abridging mode and the expanding mode may present abridged versions, or synoptic versions, or digested versions, of video material , such that neither the abridging mode nor the expanding mode offers a full and complete showing of video material . According to other embodiments, the expanding mode may present the full, complete, unabridged version of video material .","Some embodiments of video playing module  may offer more than two available modes for playing video material . There may be three, four, or more available playing modes, depending on the embodiments. Given any pair of available viewing modes provided by video playing module , one of the pair may present a more abbreviated version of video content  than the other of the pair of modes does. Thus, for a given pair of playing modes, one may be designated as an abridging mode, and the other as an expanding mode, with respect to each other.","According to various embodiments, video playing module  may enable switching from an abridging mode to an expanding mode, and from an expanding mode to an abridging mode, while video material  is playing. In this manner, video playing module  may allow for switching between a finer, more detailed and longer version of video content, and a coarser, less detailed and shorter version of the same video content. In a figurative sense, video playing module  may permit zooming in and zooming out of a stream of playing video material , not in the sense of physical magnification, but rather in the sense of viewing a more or a less abridged or condensed version of the same material . Video playing module  may permit a swifter traversal of a given segment of video material  when operating in an abridging mode than it does when operating in an expanding mode. In this manner, one may skim through less interesting parts of video material  in an abridging mode, but may slow down and examine more interesting or important parts of video material  in an expanding mode, which presents a more detailed, less condensed version of those interesting parts than the abridging mode does.","Various playing modes may play their own particular versions of video material . For example, a full presentation mode may present a full, complete, unabridged version of video material . On the other hand, another playing mode which does not present a full, complete, unabridged version of video material  may play a condensed version of video material . A condensed version of video material  may be obtained by various means, according to the embodiments. For example, in some instances, a condensed version of video material  may be constructed by assembling literal excerpts gotten from an original, full, complete, unabridged version of video material . In other instances, a condensed version of video material  may include material that is not a literal extract of the original, full and complete version of video material . For instance, a condensed version of video material  may be rendered as a synopsis or as a digest that is based upon the original, full, complete version of video material , but that is not a simple excerption. In various concrete renderings, a condensed version of video material  may be assembled or created manually by a human agent. In other renderings, a condensed version of video material  may be generated automatically. For example, a limited number of frames from the original, full and complete version of video material  may be extracted automatically at regular time intervals for assembly into a condensed rendering of video material . For another example, new video frames may be automatically generated by combining elements extracted from individual video frames of the original, full and complete version of video material , or by transforming content resident in the original, full and complete version of video material  to produce new video content. Any of a wide variety of algorithms or methods may be used to derive new video content from the original, full and complete recording of video material , and thus to generate a particular condensed version of video material . A particular playing mode may be invoked, either manually or automatically, according to various embodiments, to play a particular condensed version of video material . According to some embodiments, one condensed version of video material  may be derived from another condensed version of video material , without resorting to the original, full and complete version of video material .","Condensed versions of video material  may be generated in advance of the playing of such condensed versions, according to some embodiments. For instance, a publisher or purveyor or user of video material  may manufacture condensed versions of the original, full and complete version of video material , and may furnish the original, full and complete version of video material , along with the condensed versions, to video playing module .","In other embodiments, generation of condensed versions of the original, full and complete version of video material  may be dynamically performed by video playing module , in immediate response to a signal to play video material  in a particular viewing mode. Alternatively, video playing module  may generate a condensed version of video material  before receiving a request to play video material  in a mode corresponding to the condensed version. Video playing module  may derive a condensed version of the original, full and complete version of video material  either from another, preexisting condensed version of video material , or from the original, full and complete version of video material  itself. Video playing module  may generate such a condensed version in the same manner as a publisher or purveyor or user of video material  may generate a condensed version, using techniques provided by a publisher or purveyor or user of video material , according to some embodiments. According to other embodiments, video playing module  may generate a condensed version of video material  using techniques built in to video playing module  that do not depend on techniques used by a creator or user or purveyor of video material .","When video playing module  receives input to play video content in a particular viewing mode, video playing module  may select a version of video material  that matches the particular viewing mode. The selection may be determined by referring to a data structure listing viewing modes and various versions of video material  that match the various viewing modes.","If video playing module  receives input to switch from a current viewing mode for viewing video material  to another viewing mode for viewing video material , then in addition to selecting a condensed version of video material  that matches the other viewing mode, video playing module  may also determine a portion of video material  that is to be played in the other viewing mode, based on a location within the version of video material  that is presently playing in the current viewing mode.","For example, if video playing module  receives input to play video material  in an expanding mode that presents more detail than a currently-playing abridging mode does, then video playing module  may locate, within the abridging-mode version of video material , one or more frames which appeared on video display  approximately when the input to change modes was initiated, or it may determine some segment within the abridging-mode version of video material  that corresponds to the signal to switch viewing modes. Video playing mode  may then match the determined frames or segment of the abridging-mode version of video material  to a corresponding portion of the expanding-mode version of video material . The corresponding portion of the expanding-mode version of video material  may be matched using various criteria, according to the embodiments. For instance, video playing module may choose a simple superset of video frames that contain video frames which appeared on video display  approximately when the input to change modes was initiated. Such a superset may include some or all of the frames belonging to the expanding-mode version of video material , depending on requirements of the different embodiments. For another instance, video playing module  may determine the corresponding portion of the expanding-mode version of video material  by referring to a data structure that links locations within the abridging-mode version of video material  to matching subdivisions of the expanding-mode version of video material , and may begin playing a matching subdivision of the expanding-mode version of video material .","Various parameters may be set or invoked for matching a portion of the expanding-mode version of video material  with a given location within the abridging-mode version. For example, video playing module  may use a parameter specifying an amount of time allocated for playing a matching portion of the expanding-mode version of video material , and may tailor the matching portion so that it will play for the specified amount of time. Another parameter may designate a level within a multi-level classification for the expanding-mode version of video material . The designated level may specify a small, refined subdivision of the expanding-mode version of video material , or it may denote a larger, longer block containing several of the small, refined subdivisions. Still another parameter may specify that the matching portion of the expanding-mode version of video material  must play continuously from the beginning of the entire expanding-mode version of video material  to a point matching the given location within the abridging-mode version, or, alternatively, from a point in the expanding-mode version matching the given location within the abridging-mode version to the end of the entire expanding-mode version of video material . Video playing module  may refer to a variety of such controlling parameters, or to a configuration file, or to some other data structure in matching a portion of the expanding-mode version of video material  to a location within the abridging-mode version of video material .","In a similar fashion, when video playing module  receives input to play video material  in an abridging mode that presents a more concise representation of video material  than a currently-playing expanding mode does, then video playing module  may match a portion of the abridging-mode version of video material  to a location within the currently-playing expanding-mode version of video material , and then begin playing the matching abridging-mode version of video material .","By operating in the manner described in the foregoing paragraphs, video playing module  may permit fluid switching back and forth between viewing modes that offer varying levels of abridgment of video material . Switches between modes may be made at will, during continuous, uninterrupted playing of video material , according to numerous embodiments.","In some embodiments, in addition to providing the functions already described, video playing module  may also furnish a timeline interface displaying a representation of video material  comprising one or more video presentations. Video playing module  may implement any or all of the timeline features of the example embodiments illustrated in , as well as other timeline features, as described below. According to some embodiments, one or more video presentations may be assembled, either manually or automatically, to collectively form video material . Video playing module  may depict the one or more video presentations in a visible representation. Timeline bar  shown in  provides an example of one kind of visible representation of video material .","Video playing module  may automatically play several video presentations represented on timeline interface  in a given sequential order. In some implementations, video playing module  may play represented video presentations completely through until all of them have been played, without changing viewing modes. In such embodiments, switching from one viewing mode to another viewing mode may require additional input to video playing module . Additional input to switch from one viewing mode to another may be provided a human user, in some instances. In other instances, input to switch viewing modes may be generated programmatically, without requiring user action. In certain cases, input to switch viewing modes may be embedded within video presentations themselves, or within configuration files governing the playing of the video presentations, as described above.","The manner in which video playing module  represents timeline bar  may vary according to numerous embodiments. For example, video playing module  may present discrete boxes, each corresponding to one of the video presentations, or to subdivisions of the video presentations. As another example, video playing module  may show several rows, each corresponding to a different viewing mode, and the several rows may be coordinated to reflect current playing states. If one of the rows represents a viewing mode that is currently in use, then it may be visibly distinguished from the other rows, while the rows' individual progress bars, like progress bar  of , may be calibrated to move in synchronization as playing of video material  progresses. Video playing module  may also synchronize the several rows in other ways, such as by color coordination of discrete portions of timeline bars  which represent matching portions of video material , or by other kinds of integration. In general, video playing module  may implement a variety of representations of video material .","Video playing module  may also implement any or all of the other timeline features discussed for the embodiments illustrated in . In particular, video playing module  may be configured to adjust the length of a part of timeline bar  representing a currently-playing component of video material  in case video playing module  receives input to switch from one viewing mode to another viewing mode. For example, if the received input indicates switching viewing modes in the abridging-to-expanding direction, then in the event that the portion of the expanding-mode version of video material  matching the currently-playing abridging-mode version of video material  is longer than the currently-playing abridging-mode version, then video playing module  may lengthen, enlarge, expand, or otherwise adjust a part of timeline bar  representing the currently-playing component of video material , and may correspondingly shorten, reduce, contract, or otherwise adjust parts of timeline bar  not representing the currently-playing component of video material . Such adjustments may occur in reverse if the viewing modes toggle in the expanding-to-abridging direction.","Other kinds of adjustment may be implemented, according to various embodiments. For example, upon receiving a command to switch from an abridging to an expanding mode, video playing module  may preserve a representation of video material  playing in the abridging mode, and additionally generate a separate representation of video material  playing in the expanding mode. After switching from the abridging to the expanding mode, video playing module  may correlate the two separate representations so that various timeline features are visibly matched or coordinated. For example, if some fraction of the abridging-mode version of video material  abridges a corresponding fraction of the expanding-mode version of video material , then their separate representations on timeline interface  may be colored to match. While playing proceeds in the expanding mode, dynamic changes to the separate expanding-mode representation of video material  may be reflected in the abridging-mode representation of video material . For instance, separate progress bars  may move synchronously as playing of video material  continues. Indications of transitions from one subdivision of video material  to another may also be synchronously displayed on the two separate representations.","Video playing module  may also be configured to display the total amount of time required to play video material  that is currently represented in the timeline representation of video presentations, but that has not yet been played, based on a current mode for playing the video material. As discussed previously, area  of timeline bar , depicted in , may denote video content which is scheduled for playing, but which has not yet been played. As long as video playing module plays video material  in one viewing mode without switching to another viewing mode, progress bar  may grow and area  may shrink, because the proportion of video material  that has already played may keep growing, while the proportion of video material  which has not yet been played may continue to diminish. However, if video playing module  switches from a first playing mode to a second playing mode, then the replacement of a first-playing-mode version of video material  by a second-playing-mode version of video material  may alter the amount of time needed to finish playing video material  in the second playing mode. In response to such a substitution, video playing module  may display an updated total amount of time required to finish viewing unplayed video material  that is currently represented on timeline interface .","In addition to displaying the total time needed for viewing unplayed video material  shown in the current-playing-mode representation of video presentations, video playing module  may also indicate a fraction of video material  which cannot be viewed if the total time exceeds a maximum amount of time available for viewing. Such an indication may be based upon a maximum amount of available viewing time which has been preset, either by a human viewer, or by a configuration file, or by some other means for establishing a maximum amount of available viewing time. Video playing module  may use various means to indicate the fraction of video material  which cannot be viewed. For example, special coloring or highlighting may be applied to a part of timeline interface  which represents video material  which cannot be viewed in the current playing mode within the preset maximum amount of time available for viewing. For some embodiments, video playing module  may permit a human user or other agency to increase or decrease the maximum amount of time available for viewing, and may responsively update features of timeline interface  which depend on the preset maximum amount of time available for viewing.",{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0078","num":"0077"},"figref":"FIG. 3","b":["25","110","110","300","25","110","310","110","25","110","320","25","110","330"]},"As described above, video playing module  may receive many different kinds of input signaling a switch from one viewing mode to another. In various embodiments, a user or a software entity or a hardware component may issue a signal to switch from one viewing mode to another viewing mode. In some embodiments, a user may generate switching input by activating a control element of an interface, like control element  in . In some embodiments, a user may signal video playing module  to switch from one mode of playing to another mode of playing by touching video display , by touching a control button on a remote control device, by mouse or pointer manipulation, by pressing one or more keys of a keyboard, or by other suitable methods for generating input.","In still other embodiments, a signal for switching from one mode of playing video content  to another mode of playing video content  may be generated programmatically, without user intervention. For example, input to switch playing modes may be embedded within video content , or within configuration files governing the playing of video content . In some embodiments, cues recognizable by video playing module  may be embedded in video material  to trigger automatic switches from one playing mode to another playing mode. For another example, a configuration file that governs the manner in which video material  is played may inform video playing module  that it ought to switch from playing video material  in one mode to playing video material  in a different mode.",{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0081","num":"0080"},"figref":["FIGS. 4A and 4B","FIG. 4A","FIGS. 1A-1C","FIGS. 1A-1C"],"b":["25","110","400","110","120","110","25","110","25","25","110","110","110","130","110","25","110","25","110"]},"Video playing module  may also be configured to display a total time required to play video content  that has not yet been played, based on a current mode for playing video content  (, ). According to some embodiments, video playing module  may devise a timeline interface that includes a representation of a fraction of video content  that has not yet been played. For embodiments like the ones illustrated in , video playing module  may furnish area  to represent video content  which is scheduled for playing, but which has not yet been played. If video playing module  switches from a first playing mode to a second playing mode, then the replacement of a first-playing-mode version of video material  by a second-playing-mode version of video material  may alter the amount of time needed to finish playing video material  in the second playing mode. In response to such a substitution, video playing module  may display an updated total amount of time required to finish viewing unplayed video material  that is currently represented on timeline interface  (,  & , ).","Elements of a timeline interface, such as a representation of individual video presentations included in video material , or a display of total remaining playing time, may be laid out to provide a user easy, immediate, and continually-updated orientation. The user may quickly and effortlessly discern a current playing position within the entirety of video content , and may also gather a more local sense of bearing for a currently-active viewing mode that may present a detailed version of video content , and that may break a presentation into subdivisions which are not perceptible when viewing video content  in a more condensed playing mode. The user may be continually apprised of how much time is left for viewing video content , receiving immediate notice when a change in viewing mode alters the length of time needed to view remaining video content .","Provision for setting a maximum amount of time available for viewing video content  may permit a human user or an automated mechanism to establish a maximum available viewing time, according to some implementations of video playing module  (, ). Some embodiments may permit resetting a preset maximum amount of time available for viewing video content . For example, if switching from one viewing mode to another viewing mode requires playing a shorter or a lengthier version of video material , then an operator may wish to change the setting for a maximum amount of time available for viewing video content . Accordingly, some embodiments of video playing module  may provide an operator with a mechanism for changing the maximum amount of time available for viewing video content . Such a change may be accomplished by using a variety of known methods of input. For example, video playing module  may display an interface control element that permits an operator to change the maximum amount of viewing time by typing in a value, or by selecting a value using mouse input.","For embodiments including a parameter that sets a maximum amount of time available for viewing video content , video playing module  may also indicate a fraction of video material  which cannot be viewed if the total time required to play remaining video content  exceeds a maximum amount of time available for viewing video content  (,  & , ). Calculation of such a fraction may depend on the viewing mode in which video material  is currently playing, and may be reassessed if there is a switch from one viewing mode to another viewing mode. Conversely, if the total time required to play remaining video content  is less than a maximum preset amount of time available for viewing video content , then video playing module  may indicate spare time not required to finish viewing video content  in a current viewing mode. Various techniques may be used to indicated either a fraction of video material  which cannot be viewed in a given span of time, or excess time that may be available after viewing of video material  in a current mode has finished. For instance, special coloring or highlighting may be applied to a part of timeline interface  representing video material  which cannot be viewed in the current playing mode within the preset maximum amount of time available for viewing. Coloring may also extend along timeline interface  past the representation of video content  in order to show a graphical measure of excess time that may be available after viewing of video material  in a current mode has been completed.","On the basis of such time indications, an operator or other agency may wish to modify the assemblage of video material  scheduled for playing in a current playing mode. For example, a determination may be made to delete or to add video content scheduled for playing by video playing module . Alternatively, an operator or an automated agent may decide to switch from one viewing mode to another viewing mode in order to lengthen or shorten the total time required to play remaining video content .","Video playing module  may provide assorted mechanisms for receiving input to switch from one viewing mode to another viewing mode (,  & , ). For example, as explained in the previous description of , an interactive interface element  may function as a viewing-mode selector. Alternatively, an operator may press a combination of keys on a keyboard, or may press a physical button implemented in hardware to signal a desire to switch between or among two or more playing modes for video content . As discussed above, a mechanism for dynamically and fluidly switching among several viewing modes offering varying levels of abridgment of video material  while playing video material  may greatly ease and accelerate the process of sifting through a series of video episodes, or even one long video production, in order to locate compelling or sought-after portions.","When switching from a former viewing mode to a latter viewing mode, video playing module  may select a version of video material  that is compatible with the latter viewing mode. In addition, video playing module  may also determine a certain portion of video material  that should be played in the latter viewing mode, based on a location within the version of video material  playing in the former viewing mode (,  & , ). The previous narration regarding video playing module  presents several different methods for determining which portion of video material  should be played in a latter viewing mode, and according to numerous embodiments, video playing module  may match portions of one modal version of video material  with another modal version of video material  in numerous ways. Single embodiments of video playing module  may also implement several different methods for associating portions of two different viewing-mode versions of video material , where the portions may range in size from few to many video frames. When it receives a signal to switch from one viewing mode A to another viewing mode B, then video playing module  may choose a particular method of associating mode-A versions of video material  with mode-B versions, and based upon a location within the mode-A version of video content , may determine what portion of video content  should be played in mode B. Such determination may be guided by one or more parameters, as indicated in the earlier description of video playing module .","After determining what portion of video content  should be played in a selected viewing mode, video playing module  may then play the determined portion of video content in the selected viewing mode (,  & , ). In switching from viewing mode A to viewing mode B, video playing module  may expand or contract a part of the timeline interface in order to accommodate a representation of a portion of video content  scheduled to play in viewing mode B. Other parts of the timeline may be correspondingly shrunk or enlarged to compensate for the expansion or contraction of part of the timeline interface (,  & , ).","Exemplary Computer System","It is contemplated that in some embodiments, any of the methods, techniques or components described above may be implemented as instructions and data capable of being stored or conveyed via a computer-accessible medium.
