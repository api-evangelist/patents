title: Creating and maintaining images of browsed documents
abstract: Embodiments automatically create dynamic thumbnail images corresponding to accessed web pages. Thumbnails, snapshots, or other images are generated for each of a plurality of the web pages (e.g., viewed or visited by a user, or pre-fetched by a browser). The images are provided to the user as, for example, active tiles in a browser tab or on a desktop background. As content on the web pages updates, the images are re-created and visually distinguished from other images to enable the user to quickly identify the images that correspond to updated web pages. The user interacts with the images to view the corresponding web pages.

{"@attributes":{"id":"description"},"BRFSUM":[{},{}],"heading":["BACKGROUND","SUMMARY","DETAILED DESCRIPTION","ADDITIONAL EXAMPLES"],"p":["Some data available from the Internet is updated often. For example, stock prices change, bids are placed on auction, news stories are added, blog entries are posted, shopping deals are found, and the like. While some existing browsers maintain a history of locations visited by a user and cache data viewed by the user, devices with limited memory quickly discard the cached data. Further, many users consistently re-visit particular web pages multiple times throughout a given day to look for updated data. With some existing systems, the users have to launch a web browser and then navigate to each of the individual web sites of interest. Considerable time may be spent by the users while attempting to stay current.","Embodiments of the disclosure provide dynamic thumbnail images corresponding to web pages viewed by a user. A computing device creates images for each of the web pages accessed by the user. One or more of the created images are provided for display to the user on the computing device. After one or more of the web pages are subsequently updated, the image of the updated web page is re-created and visually distinguished from the images corresponding to web pages that have not been updated. The visually distinguished, re-created images are presented for display to the user on the computing device.","This Summary is provided to introduce a selection of concepts in a simplified form that are further described below in the Detailed Description. This Summary is not intended to identify key features or essential features of the claimed subject matter, nor is it intended to be used as an aid in determining the scope of the claimed subject matter.","Corresponding reference characters indicate corresponding parts throughout the drawings.","Referring to the figures, embodiments of the disclosure enable the automatic creation and maintenance of dynamic thumbnail images  corresponding to documents viewed by a user . The dynamic thumbnail images  enable the user  to quickly determine whether the documents corresponding to the dynamic thumbnail images  have been updated. For example, the dynamic thumbnail images  corresponding to updated documents are flagged or otherwise visually distinguished from the dynamic thumbnail images  corresponding to documents that have not been updated.","In some embodiments, the dynamic thumbnail images  are automatically created as active tiles displayed in a browser tab or on a desktop background of a computing device  of the user . For example, the dynamic thumbnail images  represent snapshots of web pages  accessed by the user . While described below in some embodiments with respect to web pages , mobile computing devices, and active tiles, aspects of the disclosure are not limited as such and instead are operable with any documents, devices, and images.","Aspects of the disclosure further enable the user  to \u201cglance and go\u201d by viewing the dynamic thumbnail images  to determine whether the corresponding document or other content has been updated, without having to execute the application  associated with the document. The user  is able to customize display of the dynamic thumbnail images  by selecting which documents to be represented by the images , and which images  to be shown in a browser tab or home screen.","Referring next to , an exemplary block diagram illustrates the computing device  with a browser  accessing a network . In the example of , the user  interacts and\/or operates the computing device . The computing device  executes at least the browser  that is used to obtain content from other computing devices via the network . For example, the computing device  executes the browser  to access web sites via the Internet.","The computing device  further executes dynamic thumbnail image management logic , such as illustrated and described below with reference to  and\/or . The dynamic thumbnail image management logic  operates to cache copies of web pages  from the browser , and create and maintain dynamic thumbnail images  in a browser tab, on the desktop, or on the home screen of the user . For example, the logic  calls application programming interfaces (APIs) associated with the dynamic thumbnail images  to create and render the dynamic thumbnail images . The logic  also translates commands sent to the browser  to determine whether web page updates have occurred and to obtain those updates.","Referring next to , an exemplary block diagram illustrates the computing device  having a memory area  storing web pages  and dynamic thumbnail images  based thereon. In the example of , the computing device  represents a system for providing dynamic thumbnail images  corresponding to web pages  on the computing device . The computing device  represents any device executing instructions (e.g., as application programs, operating system functionality, or both) to implement the operations and functionality associated with the computing device . The computing device  may include a mobile computing device or any other portable device. In some embodiments, the mobile computing device includes a mobile telephone, laptop, tablet, computing pad, netbook, gaming device, and\/or portable media player. The computing device  may also include less portable devices such as desktop personal computers, kiosks, and tabletop devices. Additionally, the computing device  may represent a group of processing units or other computing devices.","The computing device  has at least one processor , at least one display , and the memory area . The processor  includes any quantity of processing units, and is programmed to execute computer-executable instructions for implementing aspects of the disclosure. The instructions may be performed by the processor  or by multiple processors executing within the computing device , or performed by a processor external to the computing device . In some embodiments, the processor  is programmed to execute instructions such as those illustrated in the figures (e.g.,  and\/or ).","In some embodiments, the display  includes any means for displaying data to the user  and\/or receiving data from the user . The display  may include a touch screen display or any other form of display. The display  may have associated therewith a graphics card and computer-executable instructions (e.g., a driver) for operating the graphics card.","The display  may include one or more user interfaces, portions, or views that may be displayed at the same time, at different times, adjacent to each other, overlaid with one another, and\/or any of the above. In some embodiments, the user interfaces are windows that may be positioned on the display . In the example of , the display  includes at least a tile user interface  and a browser user interface . The tile user interface  represents an area for displaying one or more tiles. Tiles enable the user  to view content and\/or perform functions without navigating away from the tile user interface . For example, the tile user interface  may correspond to a home screen on a mobile computing device and\/or a desktop background on the computing device . The tile user interface  is separate from the browser user interface .","The browser user interface  represents an area for displaying output from the browser . The browser  represents any application  or logic for enabling the user  to obtain content from another computing device or from a process executing on the computing device . The browser  may be, for example, a web browser.","The computing device  further has one or more computer readable media such as the memory area . The memory area  includes any quantity of media associated with or accessible by the computing device . The memory area  may be internal to the computing device  (as shown in ), external to the computing device  (not shown), or both (not shown).","The memory area  stores, among other data, one or more applications . The applications , when executed by the processor , operate to perform functionality on the computing device . Exemplary applications  include mail application programs, web browsers, calendar application programs, address book application programs, messaging programs, media applications, location-based services, search programs, and the like. The applications  may communicate with counterpart applications or services such as web services accessible via the network . For example, the applications  may represent downloaded client-side applications that correspond to server-side services executing in a cloud.","The memory area  further stores one or more web pages . The web pages  may include web pages  viewed by the user , visited by the user , and\/or obtained by the computing device  without the user  viewing and\/or visiting the web pages  (e.g., the computing device  pre-fetches or pre-caches some of the web pages ). The memory area  also stores one or more dynamic thumbnail images  corresponding to one or more of the web pages . The dynamic thumbnail images  may be images of any size, but represent snapshots of at least a portion of one or more of the web pages , in some embodiments, and are smaller in size than the web pages . In this manner, the dynamic thumbnail images  consume less memory and less processing resources on the computing device  than the cached web pages .","The dynamic thumbnail images  may include a representation of the entire corresponding web page , or a portion thereof. For example, one of the dynamic thumbnail images  may include the upper-left portion of the web page  (e.g., 173 pixels\u00d7173 pixels).","The dynamic thumbnail images  may be active images, icons, or tiles such that the user  is able to view the corresponding web pages  by interacting with the dynamic thumbnail images . For example, the user  may click, double-click, tap, activate, or otherwise select one of the dynamic thumbnail images  to prompt display of the web page  corresponding to the dynamic thumbnail image . Display of the web page  may occur through the browser , or through a non-browser utility such as an image viewing application (e.g., with hyperlinks disabled). In other embodiments, other actions may be performed in response to the user  interaction with the images . For example, the user  may select one of the images  to indicate a \u201clike\u201d or \u201cdislike\u201d of the corresponding web page . In this example, the computing device  conveys the \u201clike\u201d or \u201cdislike\u201d to another device or process.","The memory area  further stores one or more computer-executable components. Exemplary components include a browser component , a user interface component , and a notification component . Execution of the computer-executable components is described below with reference to .","In some embodiments (not shown), the computing device  includes a network interface card and\/or computer-executable instructions (e.g., a driver) for operating the network interface card.","Referring next to , an exemplary flow chart illustrates operation of the computing device  to maintain dynamic thumbnail images  based on a navigation history  of the user . The operations illustrated in  may be performed by the computing device . In other embodiments, one or more operations illustrated in  are performed by a third-party entity such as a web service or a cloud service. For example, the cloud service performs the operations and provides the output to the computing device .","The navigation history  of the user  is created and\/or maintained by, for example, the browser  executing on the computing device . In some embodiments, the navigation history  identifies a set and\/or sequence of web pages . The navigation history  may also include copies of the set and\/or sequence of web pages  (e.g., a browser cache). The computing device  automatically caches each of the web pages  viewed, visited, or otherwise accessed by the user . The cached web pages  are also available for quick navigation from the cache by the user  (e.g., without reloading the web pages  from the Internet).","At , the computing device  creates images  for each of a plurality of the web pages  accessed by the user . The images  represent a snapshot of each of the web pages  from the navigation history . At , one or more of the images  are provided for display to the user . Each of the images  may be provided for display, or a subset of the images  may be provided. For example, the user  may select images  of interest by dragging and dropping the images  onto a home screen or desktop background. The user  may also reorder or reorganize the displayed images .","In some embodiments, the computing device  displays the images  to the user . In an example in which the cloud service performs the creation at , the cloud service provides the images  to the computing device  for display, by the computing device , to the user . The created images  may be provided for display to the user  within the context of the browser  (e.g., in a tab) or outside the context of the browser . For example, the images  may be provided for display on a home screen of a mobile telephone. In another example, the images  may be provided for display on the wallpaper or other background of a desktop computer.","The computing device  detects at  whether there has been an update to any of the web pages  in the navigation history . In some embodiments, the computing device  retrieves at least a portion (e.g., a header) of each of the web pages  to determine whether content on that web page  has changed. For example, if the retrieved header matches the header stored in the navigation history , the computing device  concludes that the web page  has not changed and the rest of the web page  is not downloaded. This reduces the amount of data transmitted over the network . If the retrieved header indicates that content on the web page  has changed at , the computing device  obtains the updated web page  and re-recreates the images  at  corresponding to the updated web page . In some embodiments, the computing device  determines whether there is an update without the user  actively navigating to each of the web pages . For example, the computing device  checks for updates in the background at periodic intervals regardless of user activity.","At , the computing device  applies a visual markup to, or otherwise visually distinguishes, the re-created images  from other images  (e.g., images  corresponding to web pages  that have not been updated) to indicate to the user  that the corresponding web pages  have updated content. The visual markup or enhancement may be implemented as template or overlay on the re-created images . The visually distinguished, re-created images  are provided for display to the user  at . For example, the computing device  displays the re-created images  to the user . In an example in which the cloud service performs the recreation at  and visually distinguishing at , the cloud service provides the re-created images  to the computing device  for display, by the computing device , to the user . In an example, the computing device  visually distinguishes the re-created images  by drawing a border around the re-created images , highlighting the re-created images , blinking the re-created images , changing the color or style of the re-created images , causing the re-created images  to glow, applying a zoom scale factor to the re-created images , pointing an arrow towards each of the re-created images , animating the re-created images  to reveal a word such as \u201cupdate\u201d or \u201cnew,\u201d animating the re-created images  to make a character or icon (e.g., exclamation point) fade in and out on the images , and\/or performing any other alteration to the re-created images . In some embodiments, different alterations are applied to different re-created images .","The computing device  maintains the visual markups on the re-created images  for a particular time duration, until the computing device  has displayed the re-created images  to the user  a particular number of times (e.g., the number of times the home screen has been displayed), or until the user  acknowledges seeing the update on a particular re-created image . The computing device  then removes one or more of the visual markups from the re-created images .","In some embodiments, the operations , , , and  are performed by the computing device  without explicit input from the user  (e.g., performed in the background). In this manner, the web pages  are kept updated and available for prompt display to the user .","A predefined quantity of the dynamic thumbnail images  may be designated to be maintained. The predefined quantity may represent the web pages  most recently accessed by the user , the web pages  most frequently visited by the user , or web pages  selected based on other criteria. The predefined quantity may be adjusted by the user  via a user interface dialog to balance memory and\/or processor use, by the computing device  or operating system executing on the computing device , or a combination of any of the above. For example, if the user  visits more web pages  than the predefined quantity, the extra web pages  are cached as \u201coffline\u201d web pages .","Referring next to , an exemplary flow chart illustrates operation of the computing device  to cache web pages  viewed by the user  and to maintain dynamic thumbnail images  based thereon. The computing device  caches the web pages  viewed by the user , visited by the user , and\/or pre-fetched by the computing device  on behalf of the user  at . The computing device  creates one or more of the dynamic thumbnail images  for one or more of the cached web pages  at . In some embodiments, the computing device  displays one or more of the dynamic thumbnail images  to the user  at  in the tile user interface . For example, the dynamic thumbnail images  may be displayed on the desktop of the user  or elsewhere outside the context of the browser .","The computing device  updates (e.g., periodically) the web pages  at , without the user  actively navigating to each web page  (e.g., and reloading the content). For example, the computing device  may update each of the web pages  at a regular interval (e.g., check every hour) or according to another schedule. The interval may be set by the user , by the computing device , and\/or by an operating system executing on the computing device . In some embodiments, all cached web pages  may be checked for updates at the same time to optimize use of computing device resources (e.g., an active cellular stack on a mobile computing device). In other embodiments, the computing device  staggers the update checks across time windows to reduce the processing impact on the computing device , thereby preventing detection by the user  of any processing delays.","In some embodiments, the computing device  adjusts the schedule for updating the web pages  based on a state of the computing device . In an example in which the computing device  is a mobile computing device, the state of the mobile computing device corresponds to one or more of the following of the mobile computing device: battery level, roaming status, signal strength, user interaction with the mobile computing device, quantity of applications  executing on the mobile computing device, available memory capacity, and bootup progress. The mobile computing device may adjust the schedule for updating the web pages  by, for example, disabling update checks if the batter level of the mobile computing device is below a particular threshold (e.g., 10%). In another example, the mobile computing device disables or reduces the frequency of update checks if the network connection of the mobile computing device is roaming (e.g., to prevent or reduce incurring roaming charges).","In still another example, the mobile computing device updates each of the dynamic thumbnail images  after bootup of the mobile computing device. In this example, the mobile computing device may postpone the updates until bootup operations have completed to allow the user  to make voice calls faster after bootup and\/or to reduce bootup time. The length of time that the updates are postponed may vary based on each particular mobile computing device. Alternatively or in addition, the updates may be postponed until the user  tries to view the dynamic thumbnail images .","For each of the updated web pages , the computing device  re-creates the dynamic thumbnail image  at  and visually distinguishes the re-created dynamic thumbnail image  at  from the other displayed dynamic thumbnail images  (e.g., that correspond to web pages  that have not been updated). The computing device  displays the visually distinguished, re-created dynamic thumbnail images  to the user  at  in the tile user interface .","In some embodiments, upon activation or selection of one of the dynamic thumbnail images  by the user , the computing device  displays the web page  corresponding to the selected dynamic thumbnail image  to the user  in the browser user interface  (e.g., in a browser window).","The computer-executable components execute to perform the operations illustrated in . For example, the browser component , when executed by the processor , causes the processor  to cache a plurality of web pages  accessed by the user  with the computing device . The user interface component , when executed by the processor , causes the processor  to receive a request from the user  to create a thumbnail image  of at least one of the web pages  cached by the browser component . The user interface component  further creates and provides the thumbnail image  for display to the user  on the computing device  in response to the received request.","The browser component  subsequently updates the web page  corresponding to the created thumbnail image . The notification component , when executed by the processor , causes the processor  to re-create the thumbnail image  corresponding to the updated web page  and to alter the re-created thumbnail image  to indicate to the user  that the corresponding web page  has been updated. The user interface component  presents the altered, re-created image  for display to the user  on the computing device .","In some embodiments, the user interface component  further receives a request from the user  via the re-created thumbnail image  to display the updated web page . In response, the browser component  executes the browser  to display the updated web page  to the user . In such an embodiment, the re-created thumbnail image  is no longer marked as updated after the user  performs such an action.","If the user interface component  creates a plurality of thumbnail images  that exceeds a predefined quantity available for display on the computing device  (e.g., due to display size limitations), the computing device  displays only the predefined quantity of the plurality of thumbnail images . In such embodiments, the notification component  provides an indicator to the user  that at least one of the created thumbnail images  not displayed on the computing device  has an updated web page  corresponding thereto. For example, an arrow, message, or other indicator may be displayed to the user  showing that more thumbnail images  are available by scrolling.","Referring next to , an exemplary mobile computing device  displays the dynamic thumbnail images  as tiles (e.g., in a tab) in a browser . For example, the user  navigates among different tabs using the buttons indicated at the bottom of  and\/or using a menu system. In the example of , the mobile computing device  executes the browser . The browser  represents, for example, the browser user interface , and includes one tab for displaying the dynamic thumbnail images  as active tiles and two additional tabs displaying web pages . The tab displaying the dynamic thumbnail images  includes six tiles. The tiles corresponding to web content that has been updated since the user  last viewed the web content are indicated by dark highlighting around the border of the tiles. In this example, web page # has been updated. The content (not shown) displayed within the tiles also represents the updated web content. Upon selection by the user  of at least one of the tiles, the browser  presents the web content corresponding to the selected tile (e.g., in a new tab) and the selected tile is no longer visually distinguished from the other, non-updated tiles.","Referring next to , an exemplary mobile computing device  displays the dynamic thumbnail images  as tiles on a home screen of the mobile computing device . In the example of , the mobile computing device  includes a home screen that represents an entry point into launching applications  available for execution by the mobile computing device . The home screen may also represent an entry point for launching a system component (e.g., functionality available from an operating system executing on the mobile computing device ). The home screen may show a summary of information of interest to the user , and may appear after bootup of the mobile computing device . The home screen may also represent an entry point or launching point into other functionality available on the mobile computing device . The dynamic thumbnail images  are displayed as two active tiles on the home screen in the example of . For example, the user  may select which tiles to display on the home screen, or the mobile computing device  may select which tiles for display (e.g., based on frequency of visits by the user  to the web pages , or other criteria). The user  may also add, delete, or move tiles.","In this example, web page # has updated content to display to the user  as indicated by the solid dark border around the tile.","Referring next to , an exemplary computing device displays the dynamic thumbnail images  as tiles on a desktop  of the computing device. In contrast with the examples illustrated in  and in , the computing device in  is a non-mobile device such as a server or desktop computer. The dynamic thumbnail images  are displayed as active tiles on the desktop  of the computing device. Similar to the examples of  and , the user  is able to select at least one of the active tiles to be presented with the web page  corresponding thereto. For example, the computing device executes a browser upon detecting selection by the user  of at least one of the active tiles. The browser displays the web page(s) corresponding to the selected tile. For example, the browser may load the web page  from a cache or may obtain the web page  from a content provider associated with the web page  (e.g., download the web page  from the Internet).","In this example, web page # has updated content to display to the user  as indicated by the solid dark border around the tile.","Referring next to , an exemplary mobile computing device  displays tiles on a home screen of the mobile computing device  modified with various styles to indicate updates. In the example of , updated content is available for three of the tiles. One style for indicating the availability of updated content is an exclamation point in the upper left corner of the tile, such as in the tile with update # and in the tile with update #. Another style is a darker or thicker border around the tile with updated content, such as in the tile with update #.","In another embodiment, the exclamation point, fill within the portion enclosing the exclamation point, or border color may be changed to a color that is different from tiles that do not have updated content. For example, the color may be complementary to the current color scheme of the user interface. Further, the exclamation point may be replaced or supplemented with any icon, character, ideograph, or the like meant to draw the user's attention to the tile. For example, the exclamation point may be replaced with an eye.","At least a portion of the functionality of the various elements in  and  may be performed by other elements in  and\/or , or an entity (e.g., processor, web service, server, application program, computing device, etc.) not shown in  and\/or .","In some embodiments, the operations illustrated in  and  may be implemented as software instructions encoded on a computer readable medium, in hardware programmed or designed to perform the operations, or both. For example, aspects of the disclosure may be implemented as a system on a chip.","While no personally identifiable information is tracked by aspects of the disclosure, embodiments have been described with reference to data monitored and\/or collected from users . In such embodiments, notice is provided to the users  of the collection of the data (e.g., via a dialog box or preference setting) and users  are given the opportunity to give or deny consent for the monitoring and\/or collection. The consent may take the form of opt-in consent or opt-out consent.","Exemplary Operating Environment","Exemplary computer readable media include flash memory drives, digital versatile discs (DVDs), compact discs (CDs), floppy disks, and tape cassettes.
