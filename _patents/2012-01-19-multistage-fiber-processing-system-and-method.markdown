The increasing availability of efficient, powerful pump laser diodes and the development of pump combiner devices and attendant optical matching components has pushed attainable output power and radiance to previously unseen levels. However, the tools for constructing such devices have not kept pace. Assembly of high-power fiber lasers and their components has remained a skilled craft, requiring lengthy manual processes and delivering low production yields.","Due to the high optical power levels involved, and especially with the development of cladding-pumped designs, the requirements for alignment, cleave quality, cleanliness, and correct splice, taper, and diffusion geometry are more stringent than even the most critical of previous lower-power applications. Cleave angle specifications for 125 \u03bcm telecom splices typically allow 1\u00b0 or more of deviation from the perpendicular, compared to a high power splice which might require <0.25\u00b0 on fibers which are more challenging to cleave. Optical losses of 0.1 dB, which might be acceptable for a splice in a telecom erbium-doped fiber amplifier (EDFA), will dissipate over 20 W in a kilowatt laser, causing explosive failure of the splice. As well as splicing, the assembly process may require various tapering procedures to create combiners and mode field adapted splices. These tapers must have correct adiabatic core geometry and in some cases a surface free of contaminants, which can cause destructive \u201chot spots.\u201d","In the 1990's, several manufacturers introduced fiber preparation and fusion splicing machines that enabled the high-volume production of EDFA's for the telecom boom. These machines employed varying degrees of fixturing and automation to drastically reduce the time and skill required to make low-loss, high-strength splices. However, by design these tools were limited to relatively small fibers, typically 250 \u03bcm maximum cladding diameter. Before these developments, hand alignment under optical microscopes and flame heat sources were the means used to splice fibers, just as they often are for the large diameter fibers of today's laser applications.","As fiber lasers begin to move from research and development (R&D) to volume production, there is a need to simplify, improve, and automate the steps required for their assembly, as was done for telecom applications. New cleaving and heat source technologies, implemented in a well designed workstation, comprise a substantial step forward in making high power laser manufacturing a high-yield, repeatable process. Flexible capabilities, including multi-axis positioning, wide field optics, and multi-application control software enable splicing, bundling, tapering, cleaving, and end-cap attachment to be performed on the same machine. However, even with such advancements, there remain limitations due to heat sources typically used in optical fiber processing, which increased automation have not resolved.","Provided are systems and methods using multiple stages of heat sources to generate a substantially uniform heat zone that extends along a fiber or fiber bundle. The stages may be operated in concert, e.g., for tapering or diffusion, or operated independently, e.g., for splicing. That is, only one stage could remain on for a splicing task.","In accordance with one aspect of the present invention, provided is a multi-stage fiber processing system comprises first and second

In the preferred embodiments, the electrode spacing can be varied from 1 mm to 3 mm or more, depending on the desired transverse width of the heat zone. Closer spacing provides more stability at lower input power. Wider spacing provides even heating of larger fibers. The system can be adjusted from very low power (suitable for splicing of <80 \u03bcm fibers, as an example) to a maximum of 150 W of input power, which will easily splice and taper 2mm fibers and bundles. The effective width of the heat zone along the fiber axis varies with input power, is from \u02dc50 \u03bcm to 500 \u03bcm.","A multiphase drive circuit drives the six electrodes (3 per heat source stage) to form a three-dimensional glow discharge in the form of extend heat zone , completely surrounding the fiber  for a length of easily up to 0 mm to 10 mm, as is shown by the Gaussian heat distribution of . The preferred heat zone width may be about 3 mm. There is no inherent limitation of the heat zone width, and more than two stages of heat sources could be used to further expand the heat zone. The two triangular sets of three electrodes can be aligned and driven 120\u00b0 displaced in phase, or rotationally offset by 60\u00b0 with their tips forming an irregular octahedron. The spacing between the two sets may be adjusted to control the axial extent of the heated plasma vortex. Electronic adjustments to the drive waveforms can significantly alter the heat distribution transferred to the fiber or device. This system can also be operated as one or two independent three-phase planar systems.","With most conventional heat sources, including the \u201cRing of Fire\u00ae\u201d, the axial distribution of heat is essentially Gaussian, and the width of the effective heat zone cannot be changed during operation. The six-electrode system opens new possibilities, as the heat distribution is controlled by the relative phase of different features of the drive waveforms, and can be altered asymmetrically and in real time. This will provide more flexible heat application for dissimilar-fiber splices and tapering. As described previously, for a narrow, symmetrical heat source, the geometry of a taper is defined by the motion and acceleration of the two segments of fiber on either side of the molten zone.

At a particular degree of phase separation (between 0\u00b0 and 180\u00b0) between the voltage waveforms applied to electrodes  and , with electrode  grounded, all three arcs , ,  would be formed at substantially equal intensity. A theoretical analysis (based on vector mathematics) suggests that this would occur at 60\u00b0 relative phase. In implementation, it has been found necessary to vary the phase between approximately 40\u00b0 and 160\u00b0, depending on various implementation factors, such as the frequency and power of the drive waveforms and the spacing and condition of the electrodes.",{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0109","num":"0108"},"figref":["FIG. 8","FIGS. 2A","FIG. 8","FIG. 7","FIG. 7","FIG. 8"],"b":["800","2","3","3","106"]},"In the embodiment of , the signals which turn the drive MOSFETs , , , and  on and off can be generated by a programmable microcontroller unit , and provided via buffers , , , and . As examples, the MOSFET drivers , , , and  can be MC34151 (or similar) MOSFETs and the microcontroller  can be a PAL18F2520 manufactured by Microchip, Inc. This circuit of this embodiment allows real-time control and adjustment of the duration and phase relationship of the drive signals. The real-time adjustments can be made with the goal of maintaining arcs , , and  substantially equal in intensity or to deliberately alter their relative intensity for various purposes.","In order for the microcontroller  to be able to sense the arc intensities, small-value resistors R (for example, 100 Ohm resistors) can be connected in series with the ground return of each drive signal. A voltage develops across the resistor R in direct proportion to the arc current delivered by the electrode . A sense resistor R is provided for each electrode. For example, a 20 mA current from electrode  would result in a 2V signal across the 100 Ohm sense resistor R.","The sense resistor signals are in the form of high-frequency AC voltages. It is possible to rectify and filter these signals to produce DC voltages, which are more suitable for measurement by the microcontroller unit .","The simple rectification\/filtering networks shown include a diode D, two resistors R and R, and a capacitor C, and are provided for each of the three electrodes. This network produces a voltage proportional to the arithmetic mean (i.e., average) of the absolute value of the sense resistor voltage. If greater accuracy is required, well-known means can be used to produce a voltage proportional to the quadratic mean (e.g., root-mean-square or RMS) of the sense resistor voltage. The RMS value is a better measurement of the power delivered into the arc, which may be important in some applications.","An additional improvement to the embodiment can be to make the power supply adjustable, which is shown as \u201c12V\u201d in . An adjustable \u201cbuck regulator\u201d circuit, well-known in the art, can adjust the voltage downward from 12V to a very low voltage (e.g. 1V) or any desired intermediate voltage. This can be useful when an arc of very low power is required, as it has been found that very low pulse widths to the MOSFET's (the previous method of obtaining low power operation) can result in unstable arc operation. Alternatively, a lower input voltage and\/or lower transformer step-up ratio can be used in conjunction with a boost-type regulator to provide an equivalent range of voltages.","In some embodiments, each of the 6 electrodes in  can be driven by its own transformer. For instance, each heat source HS and HS could use the circuitry of  or .","In yet other embodiments, two electrodes, one from each 3 electrode heat source, can share a transformer and the other four electrodes can each have its own transformer. For example, referring to , each heat source HS and HS could share the third transformer for electrode  in each 3 electrode heat source. And electrodes  and  could have their own respective transformers.",{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0117","num":"0116"},"figref":["FIG. 9","FIG. 1"],"b":["900","900","70","902","904"]},"Tapering can be accomplished, in step , by selectively translating the first and second fiber holder away from each other. The method can further comprise cleaving the at least one fiber, step , and splicing the at least one fiber with only one of the plurality of heat sources, step .","It will be apparent that there are other possible arrangements of the electrodes that are within the spirit and scope of the invention. These alternative arrangements may be preferable in circumstances where it is desired to change the pattern of heating of the fiber, or where an alternative arrangement facilitates the positioning of the electrodes with respect to other equipment in a larger system.","In various embodiments, more than two stages of heat sources could be used, and each heat source does not have to be of the same type. The heat source can take the form of any known or later developed heat source. For example, the heat source can be a two electrode heat source. The heat source can include a flame. The flame can be applied directly to the fiber, or applied to a crucible that surrounds the fiber. The heat source can be a filament heat source that substantially surrounds the fiber. The filament heat source can include a Tungsten or graphite filament. The laser can be a 10 \u03bcm CO2 laser. Preferably, the heat sources provide a substantially uniform heated field about the fiber, unless there is a particular reason not to have a uniform field. Multi-electrode heat sources are narrow and highly controllable, so lend themselves to a relatively high degree of control.","The various techniques known for improving and controlling arc performance with conventional two-electrode systems can also be applied or adapted to embodiments, including pulse width modulation, ion injection, feedback control, etc. The electrodes can also be fitted with shields or focusing sleeves or other technologies intended to alter arc distribution. Known arc bending techniques utilizing dielectrics inserted near the plasma field can also be used.","The principles of the present invention could also be extended to a system of four or more electrodes, as example, but three electrodes provide a deterministic arc sequence and substantially even heating. The system could also use 2 electrode heat sources, but again, three electrode heat sources are presently preferred.","While the foregoing has described what are considered to be the best mode and\/or other preferred embodiments, it is understood that various modifications can be made therein and that the invention or inventions can be implemented in various forms and embodiments, and that they can be applied in numerous applications, only some of which have been described herein.
