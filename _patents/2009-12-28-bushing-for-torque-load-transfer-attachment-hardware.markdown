No. 11\/514,293 (now U.S. Pat. No. 7,721,522) entitled \u201cTORQUE LOAD TRANSFER ATTACHMENT HARDWARE\u201d by Jorge I. Farah, et al. and filed Aug. 31, 2006, which is a continuation-in-part of application Ser. No. 11\/326,004 (now U.S. Pat. No. 7,581,399) entitled \u201cDAMPED COIL PIN FOR ATTACHMENT HANGER HINGE\u201d by Jorge I. Farah, et al. and filed Jan. 5, 2006.","The U.S. Government has a paid-up license in this invention and the right in limited circumstances to require the patent owner to license others on reasonable terms as provided for by the terms of Contract No. N00019-02-C-3003 awarded by the United States Navy.","This invention relates generally to gas turbine engines and more particularly to exhaust duct liner attachment systems and methods. In gas turbine engines, it is necessary to protect exhaust ducts with an insulating shield in order to prevent heated core gases from damaging the exhaust ducts. Typically, exhaust ducts are made from titanium or titanium alloys and have temperature limits in the vicinity of 400\u00b0 F. (204.4\u00b0 C.). Exhausted core gases can reach temperatures upwards of 3500\u00b0 F. (1648.89\u00b0 C.). It is, therefore, necessary to line exhaust ducts with a material capable of withstanding the peak temperatures of the core gases and that prevents the exhaust duct from reaching its temperature limitations.","For particular operations, particularly in military operations, it is desirable to have aircraft with conventional take-off and landing (CTOL) capabilities, and short take-off, vertical landing (STOVL) capabilities. CTOL requires conventional thrusting of the aircraft in the horizontal direction, while STOVL requires thrusting of the aircraft in vertical and intermediate directions. Some dual capability aircraft designs thus employ variable direction exhaust ducts, such as three bearing swivel ducts (3BSDs), for directing thrust produced by the exhaust nozzle in both the horizontal and vertical directions. Variable direction exhaust ducts typically comprise multiple co-axial exhaust duct segments having angled junctions, whereby the segments can be rotated with respect to each other to redirect the direction of thrust. The exhaust duct segments interface through swivel bearing joints, which extends partially into the assembled exhaust duct. This has the effect of restricting the diameter of the exhaust duct near the swivel bearing joints. In order to properly pre-load the swivel bearings, it is typically necessary to assemble the exhaust duct segments before attaching exhaust duct liners to the exhaust duct segments. It is, therefore, necessary to have an exhaust duct liner suspension system that can be inserted past the swivel bearing joint in, and secured to, an already assembled exhaust duct. This typically requires insertion of fasteners into the interior of the duct from the exterior, which can lead to difficulties in aligning fasteners with the suspension system, and dropping of fasteners into the exhaust duct, from which they are not easily recovered. It would be desirable to simplify the installation process of such suspension systems to, for example, reduce installation time and insure proper installation alignment.","The present invention is directed to a bushing for assembling an exhaust duct liner with an exhaust duct in a gas turbine engine. The bushing comprises a body, a bushing opening and a first tab. The body is insertable into a duct opening in an exhaust duct. The bushing opening extends through the body to receive a shaft of a liner fastener. The first tab protrudes from the body to extend into an interior of the duct to prevent rotation of a head of the liner fastener.",{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0017","num":"0016"},"figref":"FIG. 1","b":["10","12","12","10","12","14","16","18","20","20","22","24","18","12","22","18","22","22","18","22","22","24","18","22","22","10","22","22","14","14","18","16","10","22","10","14","18","10","20","20","18","18","14","20","20","10"]},{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0018","num":"0017"},"figref":["FIG. 2A","FIG. 1","FIG. 2B"],"b":["22","24","22","24","22","18","24","12","22","26","26","26","28","28","28","30","32","32"]},"Front duct A is connected with power plant  along a vertical axis using forward swivel bearing A. Swivel bearing A allows front duct A to rotate approximately 360\u00b0 with respect to power plant . Swivel bearing A is controlled by a central control system of aircraft  that positions front duct A for each desired operational mode of aircraft . Similarly, intermediate duct B is connected with front duct A using intermediate swivel bearing B. Swivel bearing B is centrally controlled and allows intermediate duct B to rotate approximately 360\u00b0 with respect to front duct A. The body of intermediate duct B is angled at angle b and the aft edge of front duct A is angled at angle a such that when they rotate with respect to each other, the position of nozzle  rotates about the x-axis. Likewise, rear duct C is connected with intermediate duct B using aft swivel bearing C. Swivel bearing C is centrally controlled and allows rear duct C to rotate approximately 360\u00b0 with respect to intermediate duct B. With the body of intermediate duct B being angled at angle b, the forward edge of rear duct C is angled at angle c such that when it rotates, the position of nozzle  rotates about the x-axis. Angles a, b and c are selected such that in configuration A 3BSD is generally horizontal, but can be pivoted to reposition nozzle .  shows front duct A rotated 180\u00b0 with respect to power plant , intermediate duct B rotated 180\u00b0 with respect to front duct A and rear duct C rotated 180\u00b0 with respect to intermediate duct B. Thus, due to the angles at which front duct A, intermediate duct B and rear duct C are joined (angles a, b and c), 3BSD  is angled downward a total of about 105\u00b0 with respect to the x axis in configuration B. Nozzle  can also be oriented approximately 40\u00b0 from the x-axis (e.g. for short take-off operation) by rotating front duct A, intermediate duct B and rear duct C approximately 180\u00b0 each.","Because of manufacturing and assembly reasons, such as those described above, exhaust liners A-C must be assembled with exhaust ducts A-C after exhaust ducts A-C have been assembled to each other. Therefore, front liner A, intermediate liner B and rear liner C are suspended from front duct A, intermediate duct B and rear duct C, respectively, using a plurality of suspension systems  that can be secured from the exterior of ducts A-C. Suspension systems  span the difference in diameters of ducts A-C and liners A-C, and can be tailored to specific lengths. Typically there are about twenty rows of suspension systems evenly distributed along the circumference of each duct segment, with rows at wider parts of the ducts having more suspension systems. To simplify and improve assembly and disassembly of the exhaust liners and the exhaust ducts, suspension systems  include duct torque bushings for receiving the fasteners used to join suspensions systems  with exhaust ducts A-C.",{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0021","num":"0020"},"figref":"FIG. 3","b":["26","28","30","30","34","36","38","40","42","44","46","48","30","26","28"]},"Cold sheet bracket  is connected with intermediate duct liner B at corrugation . Cold sheet bracket  is inserted through hole  in duct liner B from the interior of duct liner B. Hinge  forms a rotatable connection with bracket  utilizing pin . Pin  is compression fit into a bore in cold sheet bracket  such that pin will not rotate with respect to cold sheet bracket , but hinge  is rotatable about pin . Typically, each cold sheet bracket, hinge and pin are pre-assembled as a hinge assembly before each bracket  is joined with liner B. Once the pre-assembled hinge assemblies are fastened to liner B, hangers  are joined with each hinge  from the exterior of liner B. Hangers  are connected to each other by axial stiffener , which, among other things, provides axial load sharing between hangers . Hangers , hinge  and axial stiffener  are fastened together with, for example threaded fasteners or rivets. Due to stiffener , hangers  are simultaneously rotatable downward into corrugations . Hangers  are rotated away from stiffener , as indicated by arrow R, such that stiffener  does not prevent hangers  from laying down into corrugations . Thus, suspension systems  are insertable past swivel bearing joints A-C during assembly of 3BSD .","After exhaust ducts A-C are assembled to each other and to aircraft , intermediate liner B is inserted into exhaust duct B. Hanger  is then rotated upward such that suspension system  can be joined with exhaust duct B with bushing , fastener  and lock nut . Bushing  provides a mistake-proof method for joining fastener  with hanger . For example, bushing  insures that fastener  is properly seated with hanger  and allows for improved torque transfer from fastener  to duct B during assembly and disassembly of nut  and fastener .",{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0024","num":"0023"},"figref":["FIG. 4","FIG. 3"],"b":["30","30","34","36","38","40","42","44","46","44","46","42","47","40","26","34","36","38","49","40","28","34","40","28","28","26","40","28","26","40","38","36","47","40","26","26"]},"Intermediate duct B includes duct opening , and first end  of hanger  includes hanger opening  and fastener flanges . When first end  is placed in position for assembly, duct opening  and hanger opening  substantially align with each other such that they are able to receive fastener . Fastener  includes shaft  and head . In one embodiment, shaft  comprises threaded channels for receiving and engaging corresponding channels in lock nut . Head  comprises an oblong shape, such that its width \u03c9 is longer than its length l. In one embodiment fastener  is a T-bolt. The profile of openings  and  correspond to the profile, i.e. length and width, of head  such that fastener  will pass through openings  and  only when the widths and lengths of the three features are substantially aligned. In the embodiment shown, openings  and  are positioned such that the length of each hole is parallel to the centerline of engine , but in other embodiments could be perpendicular to the centerline or have some other configuration. Once fastener  is inserted into openings  and , head  is rotatable in opening  of hanger . For proper installation of suspension system , head  is rotated, preferably ninety degrees, such that head  engages flanges  and fastener  is prevented from pulling out of openings  and .","Bushing  is insertable into opening  such that hole  fits around shaft . Hole  provides a tight tolerance fit around shaft , and bushing  provides a tight tolerance fit in opening  such that duct B is sealed by bushing . Additional washers can be included between duct B and nut , or duct B and head  to further enhance the seal once assembled. Bushing  includes tab , which provides for proper orientation of fastener head , and provides torque load distribution for removing nut  from shaft  during disassembly of suspension system .",{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0027","num":"0026"},"figref":["FIG. 5","FIG. 3"],"b":["30","5","5","30","26","42","52","60","44","54"]},"First end  of hanger  is positioned such that hanger opening  aligns with duct opening  of intermediate duct B. Fastener  is inserted into openings  and  such that head  rests on drop plate  located in opening  of hanger . Drop plate  also includes webbing , which strategically increases the width of drop plate . One or more webbings are placed around drop plate  to prevent fastener  from dropping through opening  during rotation or if it becomes canted in openings  and  during installation. For proper installation of suspension system , head  is rotated approximately ninety degrees from the orientation in which it passed through openings  and  such that its width is substantially transverse to the width of openings  and . Thus, fastener  is restrained from pulling out of openings  and  by flanges .","Hanger  also includes web  for impeding rotation of head  of fastener . Web  comprises a flange or tab that extends into opening  from flange  such that it engagable with head  when head  is rotated in opening . During assembly of suspension system , nut  is torqued onto shaft  thereby causing clockwise (as viewed from the exterior of duct B) rotation of head . Web  pushes back on head  thereby holding head  substantially perpendicular to opening  while suspension system  is being assembled. A second web is included on hanger  positioned one hundred eighty degrees from web  on opening  such that it assists web  in restraining rotation of head .","Likewise, in order to prevent head  from spinning during disassembly of suspension system , bushing  is provided with tab . Tab  impedes free rotation of head  in opening  in the counterclockwise direction. Tab  transmits torque during disassembly of suspension system  by substantially preventing rotation of head . One alternative to use of tab  is to rely on web  to prevent counterclockwise rotation of head . Often times, however, the torque required to dislodge nut  from shaft  exceeds the torque necessary to fully seat nut  during installation, the torque for which web  is designed to withstand. This is typically due to residual heat stresses imparted in fastener , dirt, corrosion or the like. The torque required to remove nut  could damage hanger  before head  would even be allowed to rotate in the counterclockwise direction until it contacted web . Thus, for weight and space considerations, web  is typically designed to withstand only the necessary assembly torque imparted in fastener . Another alternative to use of tab  is to include additional webs on opening  to prevent counterclockwise rotation of head . This alternative, however, could interfere with the capability of head  to be rotated perpendicular to opening  (e.g. prevent head  from engaging flange ) after being inserted into opening . Therefore, tab  is included in bushing  to transmit disassembly torque to duct B, which can absorb much larger stresses than hanger .","Tab  also ensures that head  is engaged with web  during installation to prevent improper alignment of head . Bushing  is seated in opening  of duct B and includes flange  around its outer periphery. Flange  prevents bushing  from passing through and into duct B and also assists in sealing opening . Tab  prevents bushing  from being inserted into opening  unless head  is rotated substantially transverse to openings  and  and flush with web . It is preferable that head  is transverse to openings  and  so that maximum tension will be transmitted from duct B to hanger  through shaft .","The sizing and positioning of tab  is such that bushing  can be inserted into opening  in two positions; with tab  on either the upstream or downstream side of opening . The exact sizing and dimensions of bushing  and tab  depends on the specific design parameters of suspension system  and aircraft . When bushing  is inserted into opening , tab  extends into opening  such that its width is substantially transverse to the widths of openings  and . The width of tab  is then substantially aligned with and abutted against the width of head , ensuring that head  is properly transverse with opening  when suspension system  is assembled. Also, the length of tab  is aligned with and abutted against the side of the web opposite web  (not seen in ).","The length of tab , i.e. the distance it extends into opening  of hanger  depends on the position of drop plate  and the thickness t () of head . In the various embodiments of the present invention, tab  extends to within close proximity of drop plate  such that head  is prevented from rotating by tab . In other words, the distance between the bottom of tab  and the top of drop plate , when assembled, is less than thickness t of head .",{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0034","num":"0033"},"figref":"FIGS. 6A-6C","b":["42","42","30","42","40","44","46","18","52","26","44","26","40"]},{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0035","num":"0034"},"figref":"FIG. 6B","b":["42","42","64","72","74","66","42","42"]},"Opening  is generally positioned at the center of the main body of bushing  and has a diameter that approximates the diameter of shaft  of fastener  such that a seal is formed.
