More specifically, certain embodiments of the invention relate to a method and system for hardware enforced virtualization in an integrated circuit.","Integrated circuits or chips are electronic components that exploit the electronic properties of semiconductor materials, principally silicon, germanium and gallium arsenide. Integrated circuits or chips are manufactured both as single discrete devices and as integrated circuits (ICs), which consist of a number of devices manufactured and interconnected on a single semiconductor substrate.","Integrated circuits or chips, for example, the integrated circuits in mobile handsets may have a boot read-only memory (ROM) with boot code integrated into their silicon so such a device or chip could perform quite sophisticated boot sequence on its own and load boot programs from various sources like NAND flash, SD or MMC card and so on. Also a boot ROM is often able to load boot loader or diagnostic program via serial interfaces like UART, SPI, USB and so on.","Integrated circuits or chips may be equipped with an one-time programmable (OTP) memory. The OTP memory is a field-programmable logic array (FPLA) that it may not be updated and reused after its initial programming. In other words, the OTP memory may be programmed once and may not be subsequently reprogrammed. The data stored in the OTP memory may be used for various customer specific applications such as, for example, enabling configuring chip usage features, authenticating any secondary boot images (for example, NOR, NAND, USB flashes), authenticating any other codes running on the device or chip, etc.","Further limitations and disadvantages of conventional and traditional approaches will become apparent to one of skill in the art, through comparison of such systems with some aspects of the present invention as set forth in the remainder of the present application with reference to the drawings.","A system and\/or method is provided for hardware enforced virtualization in an integrated circuit, substantially as illustrated by and\/or described in connection with at least one of the figures, as set forth more completely in the claims.","These and other advantages, aspects and novel features of the present invention, as well as details of an illustrated embodiment thereof, will be more fully understood from the following description and drawings.","Certain embodiments of the invention may be found in a method and system for hardware enforced virtualization in an integrated circuit. In various embodiments of the invention, a mode of operation of an integrated circuit may be controlled such that, at any given instant in time, the integrated circuit operates in either a secure mode of operation or an open mode of operation. Various resources of the integrated circuit may be designated as open or secure, where secure resources may be made inaccessible while the integrated circuit operates in the open mode. Access to the secure resources may be controlled based on a configuration of one or more registers and\/or switching elements in the integrated circuit. Resources designated as secure may comprise, for example, a one-time-programmable memory. A memory may be partitioned and a portion may be designated as secure while another portion may be designated as open.","The integrated circuit may comprise ROM and\/or one-time-programmable memory that stores one or more instructions, wherein execution of the one or more instructions may control transitions between the secure mode and the open mode. The instructions may ensure that one or more buffers are flushed and\/or emptied prior to transitioning between modes. The instructions may ensure that one or more caches are flushed and\/or emptied prior to transitioning between modes. The instructions may ensure that reads and\/or writes to memory have completed or are cancelled prior to transitioning between modes. The integrated circuit may comprise a hardware-defined state machine that controls transitions between modes. The integrated circuit may comprise one or more counters, and transitions between modes may be triggered based on a state of the one or more counters. The integrated circuit may reset in instances that it has not operated in the secure mode for longer than a determined period of time.",{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0017","num":"0018"},"figref":["FIG. 1","FIG. 1"],"b":["100","102","104","110","112","114"]},"The master  may comprise, for example, a controller or a processor operable to control operations of the integrated circuit . For example, the master  may be an ARM processor and\/or a direct memory access (DMA) controller. In an exemplary embodiment of the invention, the master  may execute code and\/or implement algorithms, interacting with and\/or transferring information between various resources or modules of the IC  to implement operations of a wireless handset. For example, the master  may interact with and\/or control various other modules of the IC  to process audio, video, and\/or data that was received or is to-be-transmitted via one or more wireless communication protocols.","The secure resources  may comprise logic, circuitry, interfaces, and\/or code that may implement various functions within the integrated circuit . The secure resources  may be protected such that they may only be accessed by the master  while the IC  and\/or the master  is operating in a secure mode. The secure resources  may comprise, for example, random access memory (RAM), read only memory (ROM), non-volatile RAM (NVRAM), flash memory, one-time-programmable (OTP) memory, a memory controller, a memory scrambling module, an interrupt controller, a random number generator (RNG), a watchdog timer, an oscillator or clock, a cryptographic accelerator, and\/or a public key accelerator (PKA).","The open resources  may comprise logic, circuitry, interfaces, and\/or code that may implement various functions within the integrated circuit . The open resources  may be accessed by the master  while the IC  and\/or the master  is not operating in a secure mode. The open resources  may comprise, for example, a memory, a memory controller, a cryptographic accelerator, and\/or an interrupt controller.","The bus matrix  may comprise suitable logic, circuitry, interfaces and\/or code that may be operable to provide communication connections for transferring data among modules in the integrated circuit . The bus matrix  may be operable to provide communication connections to, from, and\/or between the master , the secure resources , and the open resources . The bus matrix  may be operable to ensure that the secure resources  may be accessed only by the master  while the IC  and\/or the master  is operating in a secure mode.

In various embodiments of the invention, the mode controller  may store information, such as vector tables, that is associated with an open mode of operation, separately from information, such as vector tables, that is associated with a secure mode of operation. In some embodiments of the invention, the mode controller  may ensure that information associated with secure mode of operation is not available during an open mode of operation. In some embodiments of the invention, the mode controller  may implement transitions between an open mode of operation and a secure mode of operation via a secure application programming interface (API). In this regard, as part of the transition to the open mode of operation, secure information and\/or states in the master  and\/or the secure resources  may be made unavailable such that they may not be accessed during open mode of operation. In an exemplary embodiment of the invention, the mode controller  may provide an indication  of the mode of operation of the IC .","In various embodiments of the invention, operation of the mode controller  may be controlled based on a hardware-defined state machine. In this regard, states, inputs, and\/or transitions between states of the state machine may be tracked and\/or controlled via dedicated logic and\/or storage elements. In various embodiments of the invention, operation of the mode controller  may be controlled based on instructions or an operating system stored in a secure ROM and\/or OTP memory. In this manner, operation of the mode controller  may be independent of software programmed and\/or modified in the IC  after manufacturing.","In operation, the IC  and\/or master  may operate in a secure mode of operation during some portion of time and may operate in an open mode of operation during a remaining portion of time. In this manner, two logical environments may be realized in a single IC. While operating in an open mode of operation, various secure resources may be unavailable and access may be restricted via hardware. For example, security keys may be stored in OTP memory and the OTP memory may be inaccessible, based on hardware configuration, while the IC  is operating in an open mode. In this regard, access may be prevented via one or more registers, switching elements, and\/or other hardware components. In an exemplary embodiment of the invention, the IC  may be operable to process signals and\/or implement functions to effect operation of a wireless handset. For example, the IC  may process audio, video, and\/or data received and\/or to be transmitted utilizing one or more communication protocols.","Prior to transitioning from a secure mode of operation to an open mode of operation, and visa-versa, it may be ensured that various modules and\/or resources of the IC  are in a known and\/or predetermined state. Accordingly, the master  may be required to execute a sequence of instructions in order to transition between modes. The instructions may be fixed and\/or known. The instructions may be stored in ROM or OTP memory such that they are not modifiable. In addition to requiring the master  to execute the sequence of instructions, it may also be ensured that all of the instructions have completed execution prior to the transition between modes. Executing the sequence of instructions may ensure, for example, that one or more buffers or queues are empty, one or more caches are empty, and\/or that pending reads or writes to memory have completed or are cancelled","In various embodiments of the invention, a boot sequence may be stored in a boot ROM and may not be modifiable. Accordingly, similar to transitioning between states, the boot sequence may ensure that one or more instructions are executed such that various components and\/or modules of the IC  are in a known and\/or predetermined state and can be trusted. The boot sequence may be controlled and\/or performed by hardware. During the boot sequence, various modules and\/or resources of the IC  may be designated as secure or open. Accordingly, prior to manufacture of the IC  a boot sequence resulting in the desired configuration of may be programmed into boot ROM.","In various exemplary embodiments of the invention, during an open mode of operation, the master , the bus matrix , and\/or the secure resources  may be configured such that signals and\/or data may not be sent to and\/or received from the secure resources . In this regard, the master , the bus matrix , and\/or the secure resources  may be configured via, for example, one or more switching elements and\/or registers, where a register may comprise one or more latches and\/or one or more flip-flops. The configuration of the master , the bus matrix , and\/or the secure resources  may be based on, for example, signals generated by the mode controller .",{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0028","num":"0029"},"figref":["FIG. 2","FIG. 2"],"b":["200","202","204","206","208","210","212","214","216","218","220","222","224","226","226","228","230","232"],"i":["a ","b"]},"The secure boot ROM (BROM)  may comprise boot code and\/or customer data. The boot code may comprise booting instructions and\/or other algorithms to be executed during power up or reboot. The boot code may be developed in a secure environment with restricted access.

In various embodiments of the invention, the secure BROM  may comprise an API  which may be utilized by the IC  to transition between the secure mode and the open mode of operation. In this regard, the API  may define one or more functions and\/or instructions that must be performed, and\/or protocols that must be followed, to effect a transition from the open mode to the secure mode, or from the secure mode to the open mode.","The open BROM  may be similar to the secure BROM  but may be accessible during open mode of operation.

The memory partitioning unit (MPU)  may comprise suitable logic, circuitry, interfaces, and\/or code that may be operable to partition the memory  into a secure portion and an open portion and to ensure that the data doesn't leak between the two portions.

The data stored in the OTP memory  may comprise, for example, customer specific secrets or keys that may be used to authenticate any other codes which may run on the integrated circuit . If the authentication fails, the integrated circuit  may reset itself. Data stored in the OTP memory  may be accessible while the IC  is in a secure mode of operation and inaccessible while the IC  is in an open mode of operation. For example, data in the OTP memory  read during a secure boot-up may be hidden afterwards from any further reads until the IC  is rebooted. In one embodiment of the invention, initial units of the IC  manufactured for a customer or order may enable JTAG access to the OTP and in later parts the JTAG access to OTP may be disabled.","The random number generator (RNG)  may comprise suitable logic, circuitry, interfaces and\/or code that may be operable to generate a sequence of numbers or symbols that lack any pattern, i.e., appear random. The RNG  may generate the random numbers or symbols using, for example, a pseudo-random algorithm.

In this regard, the memory scrambling unit  may be programmed with a random number during boot-up, and after boot-up the random number may be inaccessible. During operation, the memory scrambling unit  may scramble data prior to writing the data to the memory .

In this regard, the bus matrix  may deny access to at least a portion of one or more of the secure BROM  comprising an API , the memory , the OTP memory , the random number generator , the PKA , the cryptographic accelerator , the interrupt controller , the memory scrambling unit , the mode timer , the secure watchdog module , and\/or the mode controller  while operating in a secure mode.

The mode timer  may count while the IC  is operating in an open mode and may be reset each time the IC  transitions to a secure mode of operation.
