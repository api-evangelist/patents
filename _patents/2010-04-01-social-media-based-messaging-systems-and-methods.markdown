{"@attributes":{"id":"description"},"BRFSUM":[{},{}],"heading":["TECHNICAL FIELD","BACKGROUND","SUMMARY","DETAILED DESCRIPTION OF EMBODIMENTS"],"p":["The present inventive concepts generally relate to electronic messaging systems and methods, and more particularly, to distributed, multi-account, social media messaging systems and methods of distributing electronic messages through multiple social media user accounts.","Social media systems are generally designed to be highly accessible web-based systems, which can be configured to dynamically deliver or serve user-generated content, such as user profiles and user postings, to client systems. Such conventional social media systems allow for the creation and exchange of user-generated content, and are often referred to as Web 2.0 application systems.","Presently, social media systems can take the form of Blogs (B), Micro-Blogs (\u03bcB) and Social Networks (SN). Blogs and Micro-Blogs typically consist of individual web-accessible user profiles in which individual account holders can publish content, such as text, pictures, video and audio. In addition, some Blogs and Micro-Blogs allow individual account holders to push content to their friends and followers to view. The content published to Micro-Blogs differs from Blogs in that the user-content published to Micro-Blogs generally comprises short messages and HTML links to camera phone pictures, videos, and\/or audio clips. On the other hand, Social Networks typically consist of individual web-accessible user profiles that can be associated with other user profiles of a common location, work place or college, and in some instances, Social Networks allow for two-way exchange of content. Common social media systems in use today include Blogging platforms, such as, WordPress, Typepad and Blogger, Micro-Blogs, such as, Twitter and Jaiku, and Social Networks, such as, Facebook and MySpace.","Currently, social media systems comprise a plurality of individual user accounts, which, for the purpose of publishing user-content, are each accessible in response to a corresponding user name and password. Accordingly, such conventional social media systems provide a publishing and delivery platform for individual users to publish and broadcast their user-content to numerous recipients, referred to, for example, as \u201cfriends\u201d or \u201cfollowers\u201d. These types of publishing and broadcasting platforms in which user-content from one sender is published and broadcast to many receivers or recipients are, in some instances, referred to as one-to-many type communication systems.","Embodiments of the present inventive concepts are directed to distributed, multi-account, social media messaging systems and methods of distributing electronic messages through multiple social media user accounts. In one aspect, embodiments provide systems and methods of content distribution that realize, among other features, a platform for the distribution of electronic content through multiple user-accounts of one or more social media systems, while allowing individual user-account holders to continue to create and publish their own user-generated content.

Sentiment can be determined by parsing the Twitter network for mentions of a brand's keywords when used in conjunction with a keyword set of positive and negative terms. The sentiment metric can be an invaluable metric for determining whether marketing initiatives, both on and off Twitter, are having an impact on a brand's target audience. A trending analysis of the sentiment metric can help client users and franchisor users  tie positive and negative mentions to specific events, promotions, or press coverage.","The analytic system  can further comprise a traffic metric that can measure the total amount of user clicks to the brand's website from links within messages distributed by the distributed social media messaging system .

Client users and franchisor users  are able to see all tweets that mention your brand's keyword, and subsequently save each tweet, direct reply to each tweet, direct message the tweeter via email, choose to follow the user, view the user's Twitter page, or email the tweet to another user. An analysis of the timeline can provide a history of mentions from each user, as well as an aggregate view of their total tweets, and any conversations\/direct messages with that user. Additionally, a small snapshot of each user's Twitter account is provided, including their location, total followers\/following, total updates, and a direct link to their Twitter page.","The analytic system  can further comprise a search interface that allows client users and franchisor users  the ability to parse the Twitter network, or other social media system, for mentions of any brand keywords and save the results of any keyword search, to view all tweets related to that search and subsequently save or direct reply to any tweet found during the search. In addition, the search interface allows client users and franchisor users  the ability to direct messages to the user, follow that user, or view the user's Twitter page. The Search interface is a competitive intelligence tool that can allow a deep dive into Twitter data surrounding any keyword of keyword phrase.
