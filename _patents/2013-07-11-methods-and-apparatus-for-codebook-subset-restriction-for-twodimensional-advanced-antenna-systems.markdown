To facilitate the estimation of CSI at the UE, the network can configure and transmit CSI reference signals (CSI-RS). At the same time, each UE can be configured to feed back estimated precoding matrix indicators (PMI), channel quality information (CQI), and rank information (RI), by receiving and processing the CSI-RS. In many cases, the CSI feedback from the UE is primarily associated with horizontal CSI associated with the azimuth angles. For example, PMI\/CQI feedback for downlink beamforming in LTE informs the eNB the horizontal direction (or the azimuth angle) in which the UE receives the strongest signal, and the associated channel strength. When active antenna array elements are introduced in the vertical domain as well, the use of vertical CSI feedback emerges.","The codebook used for feedback can be designed based on a 64-antenna MIMO system. However, it is advantageous to simplify codebook design to facilitate reasonable codebook size and acceptable computational complexity at the UE receivers. Some observations can be made regarding the channel behavior corresponding to a 2D active antenna array. The overall transmit covariance matrix corresponding to all of the 64 antennas in an 8\u00d78 array may be separated into two components using Kronecker decompositions as an approximation,\n\n.\u2003\u2003(1)\n","It can be shown that the precoder can be approximated into horizontal and vertical components,\n\n.\u2003\u2003(2)\n\nwhere n is the rank of transmission.\n","In LTE Release 10, the UE feeds back a CQI in addition to the PMI and RI, which corresponds to a MCS level that can be supported reliably by the UE, with a certain target error probability. The feedback designs in LTE Release 10 are optimized for single user MIMO. PMI and CQI determined by the UE assuming single user MIMO is referred to as single user PMI (SU-PMI) and single user CQI (SU-CQI), respectively.",{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0046","num":"0045"},"figref":["FIG. 6","FIG. 6"]},"Multi-user MIMO corresponds to a transmission scheme where a transmitter can transmit data to two or more UEs at the same time\/frequency resource, by relying on spatial separation of the corresponding user's channels. With a smaller number of transmit antennas, the number of users that can be supported is limited. Since the number of transmit antennas supported in LTE Release 10 is limited to a maximum of eight antennas, many designs for multi-user MIMO support are optimized for a case of two-user MU-MIMO transmission with a single stream per each UE.","However, with MU-MIMO, the MCS to be used by the scheduler for each user may need to be determined at the eNB. The MCS that can be supported reliably for each UE is dependent on co-channel PMI corresponding to the co-scheduled UE. For scheduling flexibility, a transmitter may pair a user with any other UE.","Assuming a typical configuration of two receiver antennas at the UE, single user MIMO (SU-MIMO) up to rank 2 can be supported. Further, it is expected that MU-MIMO is only scheduled by an eNB when the performance is better than the SU-MIMO. This means that scheduled users have good spatial separation. Single user CQI (SU-CQI) is an approximation of MU-CQI for determination of MCS at the eNB.","However, for MIMO with a large number of transmit antennas (e.g., number of transmit antennas is greater than number of receive antennas, or N>N), the spatial rank of SU-MIMO transmission is limited by the number of receive antennas. Hence, MU-MIMO is frequently used in such cases. Accordingly, methods are defined to determine MU-CQI at the UE. The eNB predictions of MCS may not be accurate since the receiver implementation-specific algorithms, like interference cancellation and suppression, also need to be accurately reflected in any MU-CQI calculation.","In wireless communication standards such as LTE, efficient PMI selection is associated with reducing control information overhead and reducing complexity at the receiver. As a result, because certain PMI indices are infrequently selected or never selected, codebook subset restriction has been specified in LTE to let a UE report PMI within the codebook subset configured by the serving eNB. This can be achieved, for example, by utilizing a bitmap, which is signaled via higher layer in a UE-specific manner. In one example, a bit value of zero in the bitmap indicates that the PMI and RI reporting is not allowed to correspond to the precoder associated with the bit. The number of bits in the codebook subset restriction bitmap is determined by the number of precoders allowed in both the configured UE-specific transmission mode and the number of antenna ports.","The introduction of multi-user (MU) MIMO transmissions supporting large numbers of users due to transmission points equipped with two-dimensional (2D) antenna arrays with large numbers of elements further motivates the need for efficient PMI selection and feedback techniques. The amount of overhead required grows with both the number of users and the number of antenna elements, compared to previous LTE releases, which only support a maximum of eight transmit antenna elements.","As described earlier, codebook design can take advantage of the spatial structure of the channel resulting from the 2D MIMO antenna array transmissions. Differentiation between the horizontal and vertical dimensions can be used for flexible and efficient codebook design and also has implications on the PMI selection and feedback. Due to the variation in network user geographic distributions, users may experience different angles of elevation and azimuth relative to the transmission point. However the azimuth distribution and the elevation distribution in many networks are likely to be quite different and in fact may be uncorrelated. For example, since transmission points are often mounted several stories above ground, and many users (especially those outdoors) are located on the ground plane, a typical elevation angle range may be within a 45 degree range for most users. However other users (e.g., in high-rise buildings or in hilly terrains) may experience much larger elevation angles with respect to the transmit point.",{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0054","num":"0053"},"figref":["FIG. 7","FIG. 7"],"b":"700"},"As shown in , angle \u03b8, which represents the elevation angle range experienced by the outdoor UEs, is much smaller than \u03b8, which represents the elevation angle range experienced by all the UEs. Codebooks may be designed to sample the entire spatial domain (based on a sampled DFT for example). Thus, one method for improving the efficiency of vertical PMI selection and reducing CQI computation complexity is to restrict the UE to searching through the codebook only over those precoders that correspond to relevant spatial domain.","General Subset Restriction:","In an embodiment of the current disclosure, subset restriction of Vertical PMI (V-PMI) is performed by first restricting the total number of unique V-PMI indications M that can be reported to be less than or equal to the total number of possible precoding matrices N.","For example, an 8\u00d78 antenna array at the eNB decomposes the precoder into 8\u00d71 vertical and 8\u00d71 horizontal vectors. If N=16, the UE would need to determine which of the N vertical precoding matrices produces the best CQI (in combination with H-PMI) and then indicate this to the eNB (e.g., using a logN sized bit field). However, if M=4, the UE only measures CQI on the subset restricted matrices and only reports its selection using a logM bit field, resulting in an reduction in feedback overhead and CQI computation complexity.","In a first method of general subset restriction, the indication of subset restricted or non-subset restricted PMI selection modes is configurable by the network. In one example, using the array of the prior example, if N=16, the eNB uses a logN bit field in a higher-layer configuration message to indicate to the UE the desired value of M. If M=N, effectively subset restriction is not configured. In a second example, the eNB can send a UE-specific higher-layer configuration message (e.g., in a RRC layer) for the indication. In a third example, the eNB can send a cell-specific higher-layer configuration message (e.g., in the MIB (master information block) or a SIB (system information block)) for the indication. In a fourth example, when a UE has not received the indication regarding the subset restriction, the UE assumes that M=N.","In a second method of general subset restriction, the codebook subset restriction is dynamically configured with control channel signaling. In one method, for aperiodic CSI requests, an additional bit field is used to indicate the value of M. For example, the bit field may be present or absent depending on the higher layer indication of the configuration of either the subset restricted or the non-subset restricted PMI selection modes.","In a third method of general subset restriction, the number of subset restricted PMI matrices M is configurable by the network. In one example, using the array of the earlier example, if N=16, the eNB uses a logN bit field in a higher-layer configuration message to indicate to the UE the desired value of M. If M=N, subset restriction is effectively not configured. In a second example, when a UE has received the indication configuring the value of M, the UE feeds back logM-bit PMI according to the configuration.",{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0062","num":"0061"},"figref":["FIG. 8","FIG. 8"]},"As illustrated in , before a UE receives the configuration, M=N=16, which corresponds to a 4 bit field (indicated by reference numeral ). When the UE is configured to use M=4 (indicated by reference numeral ), the UE feeds back 2-bit PMI.

As a result, there is a trade-off between frequent reports of the CSI\/PMI\/CQI in order to track and respond to channel conditions and the resulting transmission overhead.","In an embodiment of the current disclosure, subset restriction is configured based on the type of user feedback. The periodicity of the feedback is one parameter than can be adapted by the network in response. Since it provides a method for reducing overhead and complexity, PMI subset restriction is a desirable characteristic for periodic feedback reports that are configured to regularly track the channel. In contrast, aperiodic feedback may be configured much less frequently and therefore subset restriction may not be desired, since overhead reduction is not as important and the aperiodic reports can be utilized to sample the entire precoding space to ensure that the subset selected for the periodic reports still results in acceptable performance. If other precoding vectors outside of the subset are found to provide better CQI, then the network may update the subset restriction set for the UE. With this observation, the following methods are described.","In a first method of feedback type subset restriction, subset restriction is applied only in the case of periodic feedback; non-subset restriction is employed for aperiodic feedback.

The network may configure a baseline codebook subset restriction configuration, and then the network or UE may determine that additional codebook subset restriction parameters should be configured to provide a second report type conditioned on the first set of parameters.","In one embodiment of the current disclosure, a first set of one or more of the subset restriction parameters (e.g., parameters N, MC, KC, C, or, more generally, bit-fields or bitmaps described before) can be associated with one type of feedback report while a second set of the remaining parameters is associated with a second type of feedback report and may be conditioned on the first feedback report type.","In a first method, a PMI (V or H) may be fed back using aperiodic feedback conditioned on periodic reports. For example, a coarse sampled DFT codebook may be used for periodic reporting. An aperiodic report request may send the finely sampled codebook conditioned on, e.g., the periodic report as given in . As a second, more general example, a first set of one or more of the parameters (e.g., parameters N, MC, KC, C, or, more generally, bit-fields or bitmaps described before) can be associated with the periodic report while a second set of the remaining parameters (e.g., parameters MF, KF) is associated with the aperiodic report.","In a second method, a PMI (V or H) may be fed back using a report with different report timing. For example, if periodic reporting is configured, a slower report may be a type X report and a faster report may be a type Y report, each with independent timing parameters. As another example, a coarse sampled DFT codebook may be used for slower periodic reporting. The faster report may send the finely sampled codebook conditioned on the slower periodic report. As yet another (more general) example, a first set of one or more of the parameters (e.g., parameters N, MC, KC, C, or, more generally, bit-fields or bitmaps described before) can be associated with the type X report, while a second set of the remaining parameters (e.g., parameters MF, KF) is associated with the type Y report.","In a third method, a PMI (V or H) may be fed back using a wideband and a narrowband (subband) report. For example, a coarse sampled DFT codebook may be used for wideband reporting. The subband report may send the finely sampled codebook conditioned on the wideband report. As a second, more general example, a first set of one or more of the parameters (e.g., parameters N, MC, KC, C, or, more generally, bit-fields or bitmaps described before) can be associated with the wideband report while a second set of the remaining parameters (e.g., parameters MF, KF) is associated with the subband report.","In a fourth method, where a hierarchical codebook may be used, the codebook subset restriction may set up the first set and the second set of parameters by higher layer signaling.
