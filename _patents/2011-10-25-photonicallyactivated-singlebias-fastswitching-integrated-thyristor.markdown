title: Photonically-activated single-bias fast-switching integrated thyristor
abstract: Preferred embodiments of the invention include a thyristor core that is single biased by a source, such as a power source (or a portion thereof) that is being switched through the thyristors. An optically activated transistor that is preferably a minority carrier device is in series with the thyristor core. The thyristor core has an optically activated gate. The turn-off of the thyristor can be accelerated by the turn-on (conduction state) of a gate switch, which ensures a unity gain turn-off of the core thyristor.

No. 61\/406,340, which was filed Oct. 25, 2010.","This invention was made with Government support under Award No. 0823983 awarded by the National Science Foundation. The Government has certain rights in the invention.","A field of the invention is thyristors. Example applications for a thyristor of the invention include in high power conversion.","Thyristors can be used in situations where it is necessary to control high voltages and currents with a small bias voltage. Example applications include the switching of power into the electrical grid from new types of power sources, e.g., solar and wind generation devices or systems, and power quality control in the electrical grid using a FACTS (flexible AC transmission system).","A thyristor includes three p-n junctions. Thyristors are pnpn or npnp devices, and known used devices require more than one bias. The thyristor main bias is for anode-to-cathode power flow and another bias is for the thyristor gate. Additional biases may be required for switches that are auxiliary to the thyristor.  illustrate known electrically triggered thyristor devices, each of which requires a gate bias and a anode-cathode bias. Additional low voltage bias can be required for the switches.  is an integrated gate-commutated thyristor (IGCT), as commonly used to switch electrical current in industrial equipment. The low voltage applied to the gate-control terminal is used to switch the thyristor on and off.  is an emitter turn-off thyristor (ETO) that is typically implemented in SiC and used in power switching.  is a MOS turn-off transistor, also used in power switching The switches used in the prior art thyristors are parallel MOSFETs. Many parallel MOSFETs are used as a switch because of the high powers switched through the thyristors. The parallel MOSFET arrangement provides fast turn-off. In power conversion, the speed of device switching is an important concern to designers.","The need for multiple low voltage control signals causes design and reliability problems. The low voltage for control is typically less than 10V, whereas the high voltages being switched are on the order of kilovolts, e.g., 20 kV. Isolation of the low voltage control and high voltage signals can be problematic.","One method to isolate the circuits is to use an optical interface to receive the control signals. The optical control signals are still converted, such as by a photodetector to the low control voltage level for bias. The optical delivery of the control signal can effectively isolate control circuitry from the high power signals, but photodetectors introduce delays and signal-to-noise issues. The use of a photodetector typically also makes the control a binary operation. The control signal is supplied to the gate or base of the power semiconductor device via the photodetector to turn the power device on and off.","An example of a photodetector controlled device is described in Zhang et al., U.S. Patent Application No. US 2010\/0283529. The thyristor disclosed in Zhang et al. can be controlled with an LED and a photodetector as in . However, Zhang's et al. thyristors requires first and second low control voltage biases, Vand Vas in . In the  device light applied to an optically triggered driver device, but multiple bias signals are still required.","Preferred embodiments of the invention include a thyristor core that is single biased by a source, such as a power source (or a portion thereof) that is being switched through the thyristors. An optically activated transistor that is preferably a minority carrier device is in series with the thyristor core. The thyristor core has an optically activated gate. The turn-off of the thyristor can be accelerated by the turn-on (conduction state) of a gate switch, which ensures a unity gain turn-off of the core thyristor.","Preferred embodiments of the invention include a thyristor core that is single biased by a source, such as a power source (or a portion thereof) that is being switched through the thyristors.

Features may be exaggerated in the drawings for emphasis, and features may not be to scale.",{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0021","num":"0020"},"figref":["FIG. 2","FIG. 2"],"b":["10","12","12","2","20","12","14","16","18","12","12","12","1","2","12","2","12","2","12","27","20","12"]},"A core region of the thyristor  is considered the conduction path from an anode contact  to a cathode contact . An inductor  can be used to provide a desired gate impedance. In application of the  device, the only power bias is from a source, e.g., a power source such as a solar power source, a windfarm source, etc., and no separate electrical bias is required for the switch Si (or the switch S).","In the illustrated embodiment, the switch S is optically activated and the switch S is either electrically or optically activated. When the switch S is electrically triggered, it is self-triggered without any external bias. In this case the switch. S turns on (conducts) when the switch S turns off (stops conducting). The switches S and S can be responsive to a same or different wavelength(s) of radiation as the thyristor, which is controlled by a photonic beam such as from a laser  that directly irradiates the thyristor material. The thicknesses of the layers are determined primarily with reference to the voltage and current demands that will be placed upon the thyristor, and can be determined by artisans.","Specifically, when light of an appropriate wavelength (W) and intensity (I) shines on the N-base region of the pnpn thyristor (for npnp thyristor the base region would be the P-base region), and light of wavelength (Wor W) and intensity ( or ) shines on the base region of the optically gated transistor optical switch S, the thyristor conducts current from anode to cathode. Irradation in n-base (in the npnp) or p-base (in the pnpn) region create electron-hole pairs. In the case of the p-base region, the chances of positive carriers surviving is higher where chances of negative carriers are much lower due to recombination in the the p-base region with the opposite being true with the n-base region. Conduction is achieved without need for any other external bias other than the power bias, which is applied across the anode and cathode. The photonic activation of the series switch S and the thyristor  provides immunity against electromagnetic interference, enhanced reliability due to a single bias, reduced delay due to direct photogeneration, and enhanced isolation between the thyristor-based power stage and a low-voltage control stage. A low-voltage control stage is typically on a separate hardware that creates the (optical) control signal for the power stage thyristor and triggering devices. Importantly, compared to the  device, the decoupling of the gate driver pulses from the output of the device produces reduces complexity, improves performance, and causes less electronic interference in the system.","Turn-off is achieved when irradiation of the base region and switch S is stopped. The switch S is a minority carrier device in the invention, such as a bipolar junction transistor. The present inventor has recognized that the slower turn-off speed of the bipolar junction transistor is not a hurdle with the present designs and can still provide a high speed operation. The switch S turns on a finite time period after the turn-off of the switch S, and the thyristor also moves toward recombination in a period on the scale during nanoseconds. Once the switch S turns on, recombination occurs with a npn transistor in . Preferably, the switch S is also optically activated but it can be electrical (e.g. self-gated). This reduces the risk of damage to the switch S. If only S is turned off and the thyristor is not, then, the low-voltage S can be damaged or broken down because it would have to block all the high voltage if only the thyristor is turned off and  is not. The time period for the switch S to turn-on, if short enough, will normally prevent this occurrence. However, optical triggering of S helps to insure that this problem will not occur. When the thyristor  is conducting it carries at least part of the power from a source. The thyristor  can be part of a parallel arrangement of many thyristors, each of which would then carry part of source current from the source to the load, which is connected to the cathode. Similarly, the thyristor and switches can be cascaded or connected in series.","Advantageously, and unlike the conventional thyristors in , the turn-off of thyristor  can be accelerated by the turn-on (conduction state) of the switch S, which ensures a unity gain turn-off of the core thyristor . Switch S can be electrically self-triggered (without external bias as in the electrical ETO of ) or unlike the electrical ETO of FIG. IA can be optically triggered using light of wavelength (Wor Wor W) and intensity (Ior Ior I).","A device in accordance with the embodiment of  has been simulated and the simulations via ATLAS in MixedMode show superior operation.  shows dimensions for the device simulated and  and schematic circuit diagram of the device simulated. The optical thyristor was simulated using Si and SiC. The simulation data was obtained for Si, which provides a cheaper fabrication. In the simulations, switch S was N-MOSFET (Si) connected to the gate of the core thyristor, has a breakdown voltage of 150 V and a threshold voltage of 2.5 V. The switch S in series with the core thyristor was simulated as a GaAs optically isolated transistor having breakdown voltage of 160 V. The integrated thyristor is turned on by allowing light to fall on both the gate of the core thyristor and the base of the S switch. The turn-off is accomplished by turning off the optical beam. Subsequently, the N-MOSFET device S (connected to the gate of the core thyristor) turns on, allowing the minority carriers in the core thyristor to recombine at a faster rate.",{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0028","num":"0027"},"figref":"FIG. 4"},{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0029","num":"0028"},"figref":"FIG. 5"},{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0030","num":"0029"},"figref":"FIG. 6"},"The device of  can be viewed as a modification of the  device, and results in the decoupling of the gate driver pulses from the device output.
