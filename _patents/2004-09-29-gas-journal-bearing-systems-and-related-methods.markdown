{"@attributes":{"id":"description"},"GOVINT":[{},{}],"heading":["GOVERNMENT INTEREST","BACKGROUND","SUMMARY","DETAILED DESCRIPTION"],"p":["The invention described herein may be manufactured, used, and licensed by or for the United States Government.","1. Technical Field","The invention generally relates to bearings.","2. Description of the Related Art","Generally, there are two types of bearings: 1) thrust bearings that support loads axially along their journals, and 2) journal bearings that support loads orthogonal to the journal axes. Of journal bearings, there are generally two types, namely, hydrodynamic journal bearings and gas journal bearings.","A prior art hydrodynamic journal bearing is depicted schematically in . As shown in  (which is an end view), a journal bearing  includes a tube  filled with a lubricant . The lubricant (e.g., oil) surrounds a rotating journal . As the journal rotates (as indicated by arrow A), adhesion of the lubricant to the journal and the viscosity of the lubricant creates a wedge  of lubricant between the journal and the inner wall  of the tube. Wedge  supports the load on the journal and maintains separation between the journal and the inner wall.","The load-carrying capacity of the journal bearing  depends on the viscosity of the lubricant and the clearance between the journal and the inner wall. Higher viscosity lubricants provide higher load-carrying capacity (bearing stiffness), but the higher viscosity also causes resistance to journal rotation.","If a journal bearing, such as depicted in , operates in a high-speed and\/or a high-temperature environment, the viscosity of the lubricant has a major impact on the performance of the bearing. Specifically, high-temperatures decrease the viscosity and the load-carrying capacity of the bearing. Also, high-speed journal rotation increases the turbulence and the oil temperature and decreases the oil viscosity.","Gas journal bearings (sometimes referred to as \u201cair journal bearings\u201d) are widely used, especially in high-speed and high-temperature applications. Air or inert gases are commonly used as the lubricant because of the extremely low viscosity and resistance to high temperatures.","Generally, there are two types of gas journal bearings: (1) aerodynamic (self actuating) gas journal bearings, and (2) externally pressurized gas journal bearings. An aerodynamic gas journal bearing creates a lubricating cushion of gas when the relative motion of two surfaces rams gas into the small space between them. In effect, these bearings create a \u201cwedge\u201d of gas with sufficient static pressure to support a load in the same manner that the hydrodynamic journal bearings create a wedge of oil. These bearings do not require an external source of gas but, due to the typically low viscosity of gas, require extremely close tolerances with small distances between the two surfaces. These bearings are typically used in small instruments, such as computer disk drives.","Externally pressurized gas journal bearings use gas from a compressor and\/or a compressed gas tank source that forces gas into the space between the two surfaces to create a bearing. Thus, the wedge of gas is forcefully created independent of the relative motion between the two surfaces. Some externally pressurized gas journal bearings use the static pressure between two plates to form the bearing, while others create a dynamic pressure by directing a stream of gas at a high velocity orthogonal to a surface to form a bearing. Both techniques require a constant replenishment of the gas in the bearing to maintain the required pressure and bearing stiffness. Thus, complex channeling of the gas through porous material or directional inlets is typically required to create such bearings.","Gas journal bearing systems and related methods are provided. An embodiment of a gas journal bearing system comprises a vortex generator, a housing, and a journal. The vortex generator is operative to receive a flow of gas and to impart an angular acceleration to the gas. The housing is in fluid communication with the vortex generator, with the housing having a first exhaust through which the gas is exhausted. The journal is supported within the housing by a vortex of the gas as the gas swirls along at least a portion of a length of the journal.","Another embodiment of a gas journal bearing system comprises a journal and means for generating a vortex of gas, such that the vortex of gas supports the journal.","An embodiment of a method for supporting a journal comprises: providing a journal and generating a vortex of gas such that the vortex of gas supports the journal.","Other systems, methods, features and\/or advantages will be or may become apparent to one with skill in the art upon examination of the following drawings and detailed description. It is intended that all such additional systems, methods, features and\/or advantages be included within this description and be protected by the accompanying claims.","Gas journal bearing systems are provided that involve the use of vortex tubes. As will be described in detail, such systems can provide load-compensating, high-stiffness, oil-free and\/or omni-directional bearings that can be applied to a wide range of mechanical and industrial problems.",{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0032","num":"0031"},"figref":["FIG. 2","FIG. 2"],"b":["30","32","34","36","38","40","42","32","34","36","34","38","36","38","40","42"]},"In operation, a compressed gas source (not shown in ) injects gas through inlet  into vortex generator  in a direction generally perpendicular to the longitudinal axis  of the housing . As shown in , the gas (generally depicted by arrows) enters the vortex generator  and is directed along a radius of curvature within the vortex generator that is longer than that of the housing . Thus, as the gas is forced into the smaller radius of the housing, conservation of angular momentum increases the velocity of the gas and forms a vortex within the housing. The strength of the vortex can be changed by adjusting the velocity of the gas entering the generator.","The vortex of gas located in the housing surrounds the journal  and spirals along the length of the housing toward the exhausts , . The pressure profile of the vortex provides support and stiffness to the journal . Specifically, the well-known Bernoulli equation describes the pressure profile across the vortex within the housing. The journal, which preferably rotates counter to the rotation of the vortex, can be analogized to a cylinder embedded in a uniform flow. Therefore, the \u201cKutta-Joukowski Lift Theorem\u201d and the \u201cMagnus Effect\u201d equations are applicable for subsonic vortices.","The vortex  located in the housing is shown in greater detail in the schematic, end view of  (the journal  being removed for clarity). As shown in , vortex  includes a vortex eye  that has a velocity of zero. Therefore, the static pressure at the vortex eye is relatively low. The velocity rapidly increases from zero at the eye edge  to a maximum, and then drops off to zero again at the boundary, i.e., at the inner wall  of the housing. The dynamic pressure of the vortex is proportional to the square of the velocity. Therefore, the velocity profile includes a ring  of relatively high dynamic pressure encircling the low static pressure within the vortex eye .",{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0036","num":"0035"},"figref":["FIG. 4B","FIG. 4A","FIG. 4A"],"b":["36","44","38","52","50"]},"Under the no-load condition of  with the journal at the center of the housing, the pressure field created by the vortex is symmetrical. However, under a load (as will be described later), the journal is displaced at some distance away from the center in the direction of the load. The pressure field compensates for the displacement and becomes asymmetrical.",{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0038","num":"0037"},"figref":["FIG. 5","FIGS. 2-4B","FIG. 6"],"b":["38","60","60","38","62","60","38","36","62"]},{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0039","num":"0038"},"figref":["FIG. 7","FIGS. 2-6"],"b":["38","60"]},"Specifically, when journal  is displaced from the center of the housing , the journal is subjected to a drag force  in the same direction as the vortex flow. This drag force tends to displace the journal at an angle \u03b8 from the load vector. As the journal is displaced, the vertical component  of the drag force resists the load  as well as the pressure field (not shown) created by the vortex. Thus, equilibrium should be reached with the journal being at a location other than the exact center of the housing. Note that the location of equilibrium tends to drift for a given vortex strength depending upon journal rotational speed, load, and drag.","As will be described next, embodiments of a vortex,tube journal air bearing can be provided in various configurations. For instance, the number and location of vortex generators, exhaust vents, and\/or locations for accommodating loads can vary.","In this regard,  is a schematic view of another embodiment of a vortex tube journal air bearing that includes a pressurized gas source. Specifically, bearing  uses a pressurized gas source  to provide a pressurized flow of gas to a nozzle . The nozzle , e.g., a Venturi-type nozzle, increases the velocity of the gas and provides the gas at a higher velocity to the vortex generator .",{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0043","num":"0042"},"figref":"FIG. 9","b":["80","82","84","86","86","88","90","92","94","96"]},{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0044","num":"0043"},"figref":"FIG. 10","b":["100","102","104","106","100","108","104","110"]},{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0045","num":"0044"},"figref":"FIG. 11","b":["120","122","124","126","128","130","132","130","132","132"]},{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0046","num":"0045"},"figref":"FIG. 12","b":["140","142","144","146","146","148","150","152","154","156"]},"It should be emphasized that many variations and modifications may be made to the above-described embodiments. For instance, modifying the exterior surface of a journal, e.g., by incorporating grooves, dimples, ridges, and\/or bumps, can alter the aerodynamic performance of a bearing. The journal shape can even be modified to look more like a camshaft or elliptical rather than circular in cross section.","All such modifications and variations are intended to be included herein within the scope of this disclosure and protected by the following claims."],"BRFSUM":[{},{}],"brief-description-of-drawings":[{},{}],"description-of-drawings":{"heading":"BRIEF DESCRIPTION OF THE DRAWINGS","p":["The components in the drawings are not necessarily to scale relative to each other.
