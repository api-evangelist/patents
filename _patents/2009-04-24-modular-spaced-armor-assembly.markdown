{"@attributes":{"id":"description"},"GOVINT":[{},{}],"heading":["STATEMENT OF GOVERNMENT INTEREST","TECHNICAL FIELD","BACKGROUND","SUMMARY","DETAILED DESCRIPTION"],"p":["The following description was made in the performance of official duties by employees of the Department of the Navy, and, thus the claimed invention may be manufactured, used, licensed by or for the United States Government for governmental purposes without the payment of any royalties thereon.","The following description relates generally to a method and apparatus for protecting a surface, more particularly, a modular spaced armor assembly for covering a surface.","Armor used to protect vehicles, such as tanks or ships, is typically made of hardened steel material, heavy composite material, or sometimes ceramics. Typically, such armor adds considerable weight to the vehicle. Consequently, heavier more powerful engines are required to move the vehicle at the required speed. Moreover, the added weight reduces the payload capacity and effective range of the vehicle. Additionally, the considerable weight of the armor material makes retrofitting for armor, and servicing already-existing armor relatively difficult. Traditionally used armor is also not compatible with lightweight vehicles, which in order to be functional, require less cumbersome and lighter armor.","In one aspect, the invention is a modular spaced armor assembly. In this aspect the invention includes a ceramic face plate, a composite backing plate, a lightweight low-density module between the ceramic face plate and the composite backing plate. According to the invention, the lightweight low-density module includes one or more gas-filled cavities. The gas is at least 30% of the volume of the lightweight low-density module.","In another aspect, the invention is a modular armored arrangement. In this aspect the invention includes a protected surface. The invention further includes a plurality of modular spaced armor assemblies positioned on the protected surface. Each modular spaced armor assembly has a ceramic face plate, a composite backing plate attached to the protected surface, and a lightweight low-density module between the ceramic face plate and the composite backing plate. In this aspect, the lightweight low-density module includes one or more gas-filled cavities.","In another aspect, the invention is a method of protecting a surface. The method includes the covering of the surface with a modular armored arrangement. The method also includes the providing of the modular armored arrangement with a plurality of interchangeable modular spaced armor assemblies. In this aspect, each of the plurality of modular spaced assemblies is provided with a first plate for receiving projectiles at an initial angle. Each of the plurality of modular spaced assemblies is also provided with a second plate for stopping projectiles that penetrate the first plate, wherein the projectiles strike the second plate at less effective striking angle. Each of the plurality of modular spaced assemblies is further provided with a lightweight low-density module between the first plate and the second plate for providing spacing between the first plate and the second plate. According to the method, the spacing allows projectiles that penetrate the first plate, the opportunity to redirect to the less effective striking angle.",{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0013","num":"0012"},"figref":["FIG. 1","FIG. 1"],"b":["100","200","100","200","200","200","200","100","200","100","200","100","100","100"]},{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0014","num":"0013"},"figref":"FIG. 1","b":["100","110","120","130","110","120","130","110","120","130","110","100","110","110","110"]},"Module section  is lightweight and low-density, and is sandwiched between module sections  and , providing spacing between materials sections  and . The module section  has one or more gas filled cavities. According to an embodiment of the invention, the lightweight low-density module  is a foam material having gas filled cavities in which the gas may be from about 30% to about 90% of the lightweight low-density module . The foam material may be metallic, polymeric, ceramic, or combinations thereof. The foam materials are selected because they have a desired combination of minimized weight and maximized through-thickness stiffness. An example of metallic foam that may be employed is aluminum foam. The aluminum foam may be an open-cell or a closed-cell aluminum foam. Additionally, cell sizes and wall thicknesses may vary as desired.","According to an embodiment of the invention, the lightweight low-density module  may be a honeycomb structure having gas filled cavities in which the gas may be from about 30% to about 90% of the lightweight low-density module . The honeycomb structure also has a desired combination of minimized weight and maximized through-thickness stiffness. The honeycomb structure may have any cell geometry, such as hexagonal, square, and triangular, for example, and may have any desired wall thickness or bore size. Honeycomb materials may include ceramics, polymers, polymer composites, and metals. Commercially available versions include aluminum, steel, stainless steel, and fiberglass\/epoxy composite.","According to an embodiment of the invention, the lightweight low-density module  may be entirely filled with gas. In this embodiment, the gas is housed within the modular spaced armor assembly  by module section  above, module section  below, and encapsulation plates  along the sides. In this embodiment, the encapsulation plates  may be thicker than in other embodiments because the plates  support the face plate . Regarding module section , weight and ballistic performance against a threat of interest will dictate the nature of the material.","Material section  is a composite backing plate, and may be formed from composite materials. In operation, the composite backing plate  is directly attached to the surface  that the modular spaced armor assembly  protects. The composite backing plate  may be formed from composites such as glass\/polyester or glass\/epoxy, or from metals such as steel or aluminum. The composite backing plate  may also be formed from polymer fiber boards. The composite backing plate  may be a ceramic matrix or a metal matrix, as disclosed in U.S. Patent Application 2005\/0066805 A1, which as stated above, is incorporated herein by reference.","The composite backing plate  may be a layered structure, having for example, each layer formed from a different material or a different material combination. As stated above, in conjunction with the spaced armor assembly  the surface  may provide protection from projectiles and the like. The surface  may be made from metals such has hard steel, as well as other hard materials described above for plates  and .",{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0020","num":"0019"},"figref":["FIG. 1","FIG. 1"],"b":["140","110","120","130","110","130","140","110","120","130","140","110","120","130","110","120","130","140","140","100","140","100","140","140"]},"The sectional perspective illustration of  also shows module sections , , and  having respective thicknesses T, T, and T.

For example, an encapsulation plate material that is compressible, such as an elastic polymer, can provide a compression\/clamping force between two abutting modules , when a compressed encapsulation plate  of one module abuts against a compressed encapsulation plate  of another module. The compression forces may thereby hold together arrangements as shown in .  shows compressive forces, represented by arrows, acting to hold together the tiled arrangement .
