abstract: A system, method, and computer program product of enabling a user to organize and analyze information in electronic form are described herein. The method operates by searching a first set of documents to thereby generate a second set of documents. The method automatically creates a first group comprising the second set of documents. The method analyzes the first group according to one or more analytical functions to thereby generate a third set of documents. The method automatically creates a second group comprising the third set of documents. The method enables selective iteration of any of these operational steps. The method also generates objects corresponding to process components of this work flow. The user can re-execute the work flow (process) by traversing the objects, or create a new process by modifying the objects.

Description of the Knowledge Management System (KMS)",{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0040","num":"0039"},"figref":"FIG. 1","b":"102"},"The system  includes a plurality of databases  that store documents, such as patent related information and other information (unrelated to patents).","A knowledge management system (KMS)  accesses and processes the information in the databases . In particular, the KMS  includes modules that are capable of semi-automatically and automatically accessing and processing the information in the databases  in an document-centric and\/or group-oriented manner. Such processing includes, but is not limited to, reporting, analyzing, and planning.","In an embodiment, the KMS  is implemented at least in part using an Intellectual Property Asset Manager (IPAM), which is described in U.S. Pat. No. 5,991,751, incorporated herein by reference in its entirety.","In an embodiment, the system  includes (but is not limited to) two types of clients, network clients  and web clients . These clients ,  interact with the KMS  to access and process the information in the databases .","For example, the clients ,  may request that the KMS  retrieve certain information, or automatically analyze certain information. The KMS  performs the requested tasks, and sends the results to the requesting clients , . The clients ,  present these results to their respective operators, for example, and enable the operators to process the results.","Clients ,  may also perform additional processing of data, such as creating a visualization of the data obtained from the KMS .","2.1. Example Computer Implementation","In an embodiment of the present invention, the components of the present invention shown in  are implemented using well known computers, such as a computer  shown in . The computer  can be any commercially available and well known computer capable of performing the functions described herein, such as computers available from International Business Machines, Apple, Silicon Graphics Inc., Sun, HP, Dell, Compaq, Gateway, etc.","The computer  includes one or more processors (also called central processing units, or CPUs), such as a processor . The processor  is connected to a communication bus . The computer  also includes a main or primary memory , preferably random access memory (RAM). The primary memory  has stored therein control logic  (computer software), and data .","The computer  also includes one or more secondary storage devices . The secondary storage devices  include, for example, a hard disk drive  and\/or a removable storage device or drive . The removable storage drive  represents a floppy disk drive, a magnetic tape drive, a compact disk drive, an optical storage device, tape backup, ZIP drive, a slot, a PCMCIA device, etc.","The removable storage drive  interacts with a removable storage unit . As will be appreciated, the removable storage unit  includes a computer usable or readable storage medium having stored therein computer software (control logic) and\/or data. The removable storage drive  reads from and\/or writes to the removable storage unit  in a well known manner.","Removable storage unit , also called a program storage device or a computer program product, represents a floppy disk, magnetic tape, compact disk, optical storage disk, ZIP disk, memory card, PCMCIA card, or any other computer data storage device. Program storage devices or computer program products also include any device in which computer programs can be stored, such as hard drives.","In an embodiment, the present invention is directed to computer program products or program storage devices having software that enables the computer  to perform any combination of the functions described herein.","Computer programs (also called computer control logic) are stored in main memory  and\/or the secondary storage devices . Such computer programs, when executed, enable the computer  to perform the functions of the present invention as discussed herein. In particular, the computer programs, when executed, enable the processor  to perform the functions of the present invention. Accordingly, such computer programs represent controllers of the computer .","The computer  also includes a display unit , such as a computer monitor, and one or more input devices , such as a keyboard, a mouse, other pointing devices (such as a light pen and trackball), etc.","The computer  further includes a communication or network interface . The network interface  enables the computer  to communicate over communication networks, such as networks  and , which in embodiments use the well known HTTP communication protocol.","The computer  can receive signals  from any medium via interface . Such signals  may include data and\/or software. Such signals  represent another computer program product embodiment, and the invention is directed to such embodiment.","The components of the invention (shown in ) are described in greater detail below. It should be understood that any specific software, hardware, or operating system implementations described herein are provided for purposes of illustration, and not limitation. The invention can work with software, hardware, and operating system implementations other than those described herein. Any software, hardware, and operating system implementations suitable for performing the functions described herein can be used.","2.2. Databases",{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0060","num":"0059"},"figref":"FIG. 3","b":["116","116"]},{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0061","num":"0060"},"figref":["FIG. 3","FIG. 3"],"b":["116","116"]},"2.2.1. Document Databases","The document databases  include electronic representations of documents of interest to the customer. The document databases  represent the customer's repository of documents, and are thus also called the customer's document repository. (The \u201crepository\u201d could alternatively represent all documents represented in the databases , whether represented in the document databases  or the bibliographic databases .)","For example, the patent database  includes electronic representations of U.S. and foreign patents of interest to the customer. The patent database  preferably has stored therein an image file and a text file for each patent represented in the patent database , where the image file and the text file are representations of the patent. Details of an embodiment of the image file and the text file are described in U.S. Pat. Nos. 5,623,681 and 5,623,679, which are both incorporated herein by reference in their entireties.","The document databases  also include other documents of interest to the customer.","The documents in the document databases  may be text, images, graphics, audio, video, multimedia, applications, etc.","2.2.2. Document Bibliographic Databases","The document bibliographic databases  store information about documents (as opposed to the documents themselves). More particularly, the document bibliographic databases  store bibliographic information about documents.","For example, the patent bibliographic databases  store bibliographic data about U.S. and non-U.S. patents. Such patent bibliographic data includes, but is not limited to, the information on the front page of patents, such as: the patent number, the issue date, the inventors, the title, the assignee, the serial number, the filing date, the U.S. and international classifications, the fields of search, the references cited, the primary examiner, the assistant examiner, the attorney, the agent, the law firm, priority information, related application information, the number of claims, the number of drawing pages, the patent term, the expiration date, etc. The patent bibliographic databases  can also include one or more user defined fields that can store large amounts of data.","2.2.3. Notes Database","The present invention supports annotation of the documents in the document databases . More particularly, the present invention allows users to create and link annotations (also called notes) to the documents (or portions thereof) in the document databases . Such annotations can include text, graphics, images, video, audio, and\/or any other information representation that can be stored in electronic form.","The annotations, linkage information (i.e., information that specifies the link between a note and a portion of a document), and information related to the annotations and\/or the linkage information (such as the position of the linked portion in the document, the date of creation, the creator, the date of modification, a note title and\/or subject, access rights, etc.) are stored in the notes databases . Embodiments of the notes databases  are described in U.S. Pat. Nos. 5,623,679 and 5,623,681, incorporated by reference herein.","2.2.4. Groups Databases","Information on groups is stored in the group databases . Generally, a group is a data structure that includes any number of objects that typically follow a common theme or characteristic (although this is not a mandatory requirement of groups). Groups are said to be document-centric.","There are two classes of groups: predefined groups (also called system defined groups) and user-defined groups (also called arbitrary groups).","The invention also supports other types of groups. For example, the invention supports temporary groups. A temporary group is automatically created by the invention in the course of processing a command. One application of temporary groups involves search operations. Specifically, when conducting a search for documents, a new temporary group is created, and the search results are stored in the temporary group. Groups may be created through the processing of other commands or actions. The invention permits operators to save temporary groups. For example, the invention allows operators to convert temporary groups to predefined groups or user-defined groups.","Groups are further described in U.S. Pat. No. 5,991,751, which is herein incorporated by reference in its entirety.","2.3. Example Block Diagram of the Knowledge Management System",{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0079","num":"0078"},"figref":["FIG. 2","FIG. 2"],"b":"114"},"The KMS  has a number of modules (collectively called the KMS modules).","A number of the modules interact with the databases . A SQL server  (such as the Microsoft SQL Server) and\/or other well known database servers  interact with the databases . The KMS modules interact with these servers  and  and the databases  via a database interface module , which may represent, for example, an ODBC (object database connectivity) layer.","The Network transport layer or interface  is used to receive command request objects from the client , .","The KMS  is a highly secure business decision system. In an embodiment, the specific operations in each command object are checked against the security information maintained about each user in the system. This is logically done through a comprehensive security layer or module .","The document storage and retrieval module  provides access to documents and information in the databases .","The Searching subsystem or module  provides for document and information searching. The search layer  also encapsulates the specific search engine(s)  used in the implementation of the system, which can and will vary based on available search technologies.","The Groups layer or grouping module  is responsible for managing groups.","The Notes layer or module  is responsible for managing forms of annotations.","The Analysis layer or analysis modules  perform analysis in support of specific requests made by various modules in the system.","Finally, the server administration layer or module  provides services to manage the configuration of the KMS , such as adding or changing the security permissions associated with a specific user.","The modules described above are further described in U.S. Pat. No. 5,991,751, incorporated herein by reference in its entirety.","2.4. Analysis Modules","Example analysis modules  are shown in . These analysis modules  semi-automatically and automatically interact and process documents and information contained in the databases  pursuant to user commands. Such processing is sometimes referred to herein as \u201canalytics.\u201d The analysis modules  have the capability of processing documents in one or more groups, and potentially the parents and\/or children of these groups.","It should be understood that the invention is adapted and intended to include a wide and varied range of analysis modules . The analysis modules  shown in  represent only a sampling of the analysis modules  that the invention is adapted and intended to support. The invention can support many other analysis modules  because the databases  are so rich. The analysis modules  can include any other module that performs useful processing (from the point of view of the customer) of the data in the databases .","Analysis modules  are further described in U.S. Pat. No. 5,991,751, which is herein incorporated by reference in its entirety.","3. Knowledge Management\u2014Example Work Flow Embodiments","As its name indicates, the knowledge management system (KMS)  is useful for managing knowledge. The knowledge that is being managed comprises documents of interest to users. Such documents may be in any form, such as but not limited to text, images, graphics, audio, video, multimedia, computer programs\/applications, etc., and combinations thereof.","The KMS  provides a number of functions for processing and manipulating knowledge. Typically, the functions that are performed are selected by users. More particularly, users select the functions that are to be performed, and the sequence in which those functions are performed. This is referred to as \u201cwork flow.\u201d",{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0097","num":"0096"},"figref":"FIG. 6","b":["602","114","602","114"]},"In step  of , one or more searches are performed. These searches can be over databases , and\/or over another repository of documents, such as over an external database or search engine. The goal of the search is to identify documents which satisfy some criteria (i.e., the search criteria).","The invention supports a number of searching types. These may be based, for example, on morphological processing  (involving the understanding of components of words), lexical processing  (matching whole words during searches), syntactical processing  (taking into consideration the role of words), semantic processing  (the meaning of words in sentences), discourse processing  (understanding parts of documents), and\/or pragmatic processing  (using external knowledge). Based on such processing, the invention supports full text search modules , boolean search modules , clustering modules , as well as other search modules (see ).","The searches of step  result in one or more lists of documents. In an embodiment, the lists correspond to groups . Accordingly, the searches of step  automatically generate groups . This is generally true of the invention. That is, processing of documents results in groups, where the groups include documents that were identified, or that resulted, from such processing.","In an embodiment, the groups  are temporary. In such embodiments, it is possible to save the groups  (step ). It is also possible to annotate the groups , and the documents in the groups  (step ).","The user may wish to conduct further searching within the groups . Such further searching is represented by step , and this results in new groups . Again, such groups  may be saved (step ) and\/or annotated (step ).","In step , the user elects to analyze the groups  and the documents contained therein. The invention supports a number of analysis modules, such as mapping modules , citation or plot lineage modules , and reporting modules . See also . These modules are further discussed below, as well as in U.S. Pat. No. 5,991,751, which is herein incorporated by reference in its entirety. Also consider , which illustrates an embodiment of the citation modules .","The citation modules  includes a patent citation module  (see U.S. Pat. No. 5,991,751), an author citation module , and a case law citation module .","The author citation module  operates to identify documents related to an author. The operation of the author citation module  according to an embodiment is shown in . In step , an author is identified or selected. In step , searches are conducted over databases  (and\/or over other repositories of documents) to identify articles written by the author. In step , searches are conducted over databases  (and\/or over other repositories of documents) to identify articles that cite the author. In step , the search results of steps  and  are displayed. A hyperbolic tree mechanism may be utilized for the display (similar to a patent citation map).","The author citation module  as described above is focused on an author. It can be modified to be focused on a particular article (called the based article). For example, references on which the base article is based, and references that cite the base article, could be displayed in step .","The case law citation module  operates to display cases on which a given case is based, and cases that cite the given case. In this manner, it is similar to the author citation module , and its processing is similar to that shown in .","Referring again to , the analysis of step  results in lists of documents. Again, in an embodiment, those lists correspond to groups .","The processing performed thus far may have been intended to narrow a large database of documents to a smaller set that is pertinent to certain criteria of interest to the user. This involved various searching (steps  and ) and analysis (step ). The resulting groups  may include documents that the user feels are very pertinent to his criteria of interest. Thus, the user is ready at this point to analyze in detail each document in the groups . This is represented by step . Such analysis may involve a manual study of the documents, and\/or further analytics (such as that performed in step ).",{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0110","num":"0109"},"figref":["FIG. 30","FIG. 30"],"b":"114"},{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0111","num":"0110"},"figref":"FIG. 30","b":["3002","3002","3004","3004","3006","3008","3004","3010","3018","3010","3012","3014","3016"]},"Groups and documents can be annotated . Also, documents can be individually analyzed .",{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0113","num":"0112"},"figref":["FIG. 37","FIG. 30"]},{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0114","num":"0113"},"figref":"FIG. 36","b":["3626","3626","3622","3622","3624","3602","3604","3606","3608","3610","3612","3614","3616","3620","36","3624","3628","3626"]},"The work flows described herein can be saved. In other words, the invention supports persistent work flows or processes. The invention achieves persistent processes through the use of objects. These objects can be manipulated, as indicated by step  in . This topic is described in the following section.","4. Achieving Persistent Processes Through Use of Objects","As mentioned above, the invention enables users to save work flows, which are also referred to as processes. In other words, the invention allows users to make processes persistent.","The invention uses objects to achieve this function. The invention creates objects for components of a process. For example, with regard to the example process of , the invention creates objects for the search operations , , the groups , , , and the analysis  that is performed. The process can thereby be saved by storing such objects.","A number of advantages are achieved by making a process persistent. Some of the advantages (and features of the invention) are shown in .","On advantage is a process can be easily fully or partially re-executed by traversing one or more of its objects (i.e., by invoking the objects). This is represented by step .","Another advantage is it is easy to create new processes by modifying old processes. This is represented by steps -. In step , a user copies objects corresponding to an old process to create new objects. In step , the user modifies the copied objects to create a new process. In step , the user executes the new process by traversing its objects. The user can then compare the new process to the old process by comparing its respective objects (see step ).","The invention enables users to organize and manage objects. For example, a user can save objects, delete objects, view objects, modify objects, organize objects in folders, etc. Such operation is represented by step .","The invention supports definitions (or templates) for various objects. The invention supports operation objects (such as query, boolean, import, patent family, corporate family, list exploder objects) and application objects (web reporting, citation tree, patent family tree, corporate family tree, visualization, clustering objects), as well as other objects. As a process is being executed, objects corresponding to the process's components are created (instantiated) based on the applicable object definitions.","Such operation is depicted in the flowchart  of . In step , an action is selected. This is the action that is to be performed next in the process, such as a search. This action may produce a result, such as a list of documents. In step , the object definitions corresponding to the action and the result are identified, and objects are created based on such object definitions. In step , the action is executed. This may involve updating the objects created in step . For example, at this point, a list object may be populated with the list of documents resulting from executing the action in step  (or the list object could be instantiated at this point). In step , the objects can be saved (this is an optional step).","Many objects have an input and an output. The input represents one or more other objects, which are called upstream objects  (see the example work flow diagram  in ). Similarly, the output represents one or more other objects, which are called downstream objects .","Thus, the features of the invention just described enable users to create, store, manage, manipulate, and share their work - not just results, but the operations and processes for arriving at those results. In addition, these features enable automation of processes to greatly reduce or eliminate the manual effort required to update previously generated results.","Each object type has attributes that help users document and re-use their work. Users can create, manage, and access objects from Object Manager, a tree navigation and management tool similar to Windows File Manager.","With regard to queries (searches), by defining upstream objects (such as a List or database) that will be queried, the Trigger (such as a change to a List or an update to a database source) that could cause the Query to auto-execute, and the downstream object (the output List), a user could set up a number of Queries to feed Lists of common topics (such as competitor activity) that could be shared with perhaps many users. The other types of objects will have similar properties.","Using the defined objects as building blocks connected together in strings, complete processes can be set up. Some simple examples would be:\n\nDatabase->Query->List->Report\n\n[List A, List B]->Boolean->List C->ThemeScape\n","One powerful feature of this architecture is that these strings of objects can be defined as objects themselves. Called Process Stream Objects, these objects can be created, stored, and auto- or manually-executed. They can also be copied, modified, and moved, greatly simplifying the task of setting up new processes. A goal in developing these features is to provide the building blocks to enable users to construct, store, utilize, and manage whatever Process Streams they might envision.","Object definitions are described in the following sections. These definitions are provided for illustrative purposes. The invention supports other objects, and the definitions for these other objects will be apparent to persons skilled in the relevant arts based on the teachings contained herein.","4.1.1. Common Object Features","In an embodiment, the following features apply to all objects.","4.1.1.1. Generic Attributes","Object Type\n\n","Name\n\n","Path\n\n","Object ID\n\n","Object Version Number\n\n","Object Description\n\n","Owner\n\n","Permissions\n\n","Create Date\n\n","Modification Date\n\n","Object Modification History\n\n","Annotations\n\n","Related Objects\n\n","Upstream Objects\n\n","Downstream Objects\n\n","Object Triggers\n\n","4.1.1.2. Generic Object Views","Permissions View\n\n","Connections View (see, for example, )\n\n","Trigger View (see, for example, )\n\n","Attribute View (see, for example, )\n\n","Users can change the Description in the Attribute View.","Modification History View (see, for example, )\n\n","Annotation View (see, for example, )\n\n","4.1.2. Boolean Operation Objects","The Boolean Operation Object allows users to perform boolean operations on Lists to generate List output. Possible boolean operations are (in the following, the upstream objects are List A and List B, and the downstream object is List C):","AND\n\n","OR\n\n","NOT\n\n","See also, for example, .","4.1.3. Corporate Family Operating Objects","The Corporate Family Operation allows users to define operations based on corporate entity information. For example, this object can sort through a list of patents to identify those that are assigned to a particular corporate entity.","4.1.4. Export Objects","The Export Operation Object allows tracking of exported Lists and their formats. This object corresponds to an export operation where a particular object, such as a list object for example, is exported to a destination. The export operation includes modifying the object according to the specifications of the destination (such as the format of the destination). The user would be prompted to generate or choose an Export Operation Object when beginning the operation. Examples of Export Operation data transactions are exporting to Lotus Notes or to loosely coupled analytic software.","Export specific attributes include the following:","Destination name\/provider","Export Format Definition\n\n","Export List description\n\n","4.1.5. Folder Objects","Folders represent storage locations for other objects, including other Folders. They can be nested in a hierarchy, similar to folders or directories in Windows and DOS. Although in IPAM Folders are implemented in a database rather than in the Windows file system, this is transparent to the user. Folders may be annotated.","Content View is a Folder-Specific Object View. The Content View shows the contents of the Folder, which can include subfolders and Data Objects of any type. Contents are listed in alphabetical order by name, with subfolders listed first, followed by Data Objects. In addition to the names of the contents, the listing can optionally include the Object Description. The Content View is the default view. See, for example, .","4.1.6. Import Objects","The Import Operation Object allows tracking of the source of list imports, as well as reformatting input data into Lists. In cases where the Import Operation is driven by the external source, the external software could generate an Import Operation Object. An example of a data transaction generating an Import Operation externally would be an export from SciFinder to IPAM.","In cases where the Import Operation is driven from within IPAM, the user would generate an Import Operation Object. An example of an IPAM-driven data transaction could be an import to IPAM.","Import specific attributes include the following:","Source name\/provider","Import Format Definition\n\n","Import List description\n\n","4.1.7. List Exploder Operation Objects","The List Exploder Operation allows users to easily break an input List into a number of output Lists based on one of several criteria: Publication Year, Inventor, IPC, subject matter, etc.","4.1.8. List Objects","A List Object represents a list of documents, implemented as a list of document GUIDs. Display of the List would result in any additional document fields specified for the List View to be fetched from the Patent or Document database. This object corresponds to the concept of \u201cGroup\u201d (described elsewhere herein).","Related Objects\n\n","Operation Objects\n\n","Application Objects\n\n","Permitted Downstream Objects (multiple objects)","Operation Objects\n\n","Application Objects\n\n","List-Specific Attributes","Document Table\n\n","Content Change Type\n\n","List Display Parameters\n\n","List Display Options View\n\n","List Content Views:\n\n","Short List View (see, for example, )\n\n","Full List View (see, for example, )\n\n","Abstract List View\n\n","Shoebox List View (see, for example, )\n\n","4.1.9. Query Objects","Query operations may be executed against any supported database\/search engine. Depending on the database\/search engine, queries may be structured in searchscreen format and\/or native query strings. For example, an initial Query Object implementation for a Dialog search could provide a screen for entering the Dialog search command string; a later implementation could provide a search form that automatically generates Dialog command strings. See, for example, .","Query specific attributes include the following:","Database name\/provider","Query string\n\n","4.1.10. Patent Family Dedupe","The Patent Family Dedupe operation allows users to dedupe a List of patent documents so as to keep only one member of a patent family in the result List. For example, if a list includes a U.S. patent and its PCT, Japanese, and European counterparts, this operation allows the user to delete all copies of this patent except for one.","Users will select the Family Definition that they wish to use (Inpadoc Family, Derwent Family, Identical Priority Family, or Priority-in-Common Family). Users also select Document Retention Priority, which is the priority order for keeping documents so that the retained doc from each family contains the maximum amount of useful information. An example priority order might be to retain the patents according to the following preference: 1) WPI record, 2) US grant, 3) EP-B publication in English, 4) PCT publication in English, etc.","This object has the following object specific views:","Document Retention Priority View","The Document Retention Priority View allows users to select the priority order for keeping documents so that the retained doc from each family contains the appropriate amount of useful information in the preferred language. For example, if the Output List is to be reviewed by managers who prefer only to read abstracts, then the priority order would be chosen to provide the highest quality abstract, without regard to availability of fulltext. However, if the reviewer is a scientist or engineer, the priority order might reflect the requirement for fulltext. An example priority order might be: 1) WPI record, 2) U.S. grant, 3) EP-B publication in English, 4) PCT publication in English, etc. See, for example, .","Family Definition View","The Family Definition View allows the user to select their preferred Family Definition. Possible definitions include the standard definitions: Inpadoc Family or Derwent Family; or user-defined families based on either Identical Priority or Priority-in-Common. For user-defined families, the user must select the specific document-to-document relationships that the user considers to be a Family Relationship. See, for example, .","4.1.11. Patent Family Expand Object","The Patent Family Expand operation allows users to expand a List of patent documents so that for each patent family represented in the Input List, all family members are included in the Result List. For example, if a List includes a particular U.S. patent, this operation causes all counterpart patent applications and patents to be inserted into the List.","Membership in a family is determined by the user's choice of Family Definition (Inpadoc Family, Derwent Family, Identical Priority Family, or Priority-in-Common Family). The user may also choose which types of documents to include, i.e., Pseudo-Docs, Primary Patent Docs, and\/or Secondary Patent Docs.","This object has an object-specific view called the Document Inclusion View. The Document Inclusion View allows the user to select the Input List, Result List, Document Types to include, and the preferred Family Definition.

Clustering Tools","Referring to , the invention supports various clustering modules for analyzing documents. Such clustering modules organize documents into meaningful groups. More specifically, such clustering modules analyze documents and organize them into a hierarchy or tree according to their content (using, for example, a well-known \u201cWindows Explorer\u201d-style interface).","Generally, some embodiments of the clustering modules operate by parsing the documents to extract particular information. The information may be extracted from unstructured data contained in the document (such as the specification of a patent), and\/or from structured data contained in the document (such as meta data, i.e., titles, authors, abstracts, etc.). The documents are then grouped according to this information. The invention supports clustering modules that operate differently than just described.",{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0244","num":"0389"},"figref":"FIG. 31","b":["3102","3106","3104","3108","3108"]},"However, the list  could include hundreds or thousands (or more) of documents, all relating in some way to CDMA. The user might only be interested in a particular CDMA topic, such as GSM.","In the example of , in step , the list  is processed by a clustering module. The clustering module operates to analyze the documents in the list and assign them to categories according to their content (as represented by their unstructured and\/or structuured portions). In an embodiment, each of these categories represents a group. The categories may have sub-categories, each of which also represents a group (or sub-group). Accordingly, the clustering module produces from the list  hierarchically ordered groups . These groups can then be processed as elsewhere described herein. An example of this hierarchical tree is shown in .","An example of a clustering module that operates as just described is Vivisimo of Pittsburgh, Pa., although the invention is not limited to this example.","6.2. Relevancy Visualization Tool","The invention supports other modules for processing and organizing documents. For example, the invention supports a relevancy visualization (RV) module that extracts key terms from documents (from unstructured and\/or structured portions of the documents), assigns them to meaningful categories (a taxonomy), and establishes their inter-relationships. As a result, the RV module generates a highly structured body of information that users can slice as needed. Users can generate patterns related to the documents in a variety of visual forms such as maps, tables and graphs.","More particularly, the RV module analyzes a group of documents to identify how those documents relate to various key terms, and\/or relate to each other with regard to (or relative to) those key terms. For example, suppose the key term is \u201cassignee.\u201d In this patent related example, the RV module would analyze a group of patents to determine who their assignees are. The RV performs this task by performing a key word search of the documents, for example.",{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0251","num":"0396"},"figref":["FIG. 34","FIG. 35"],"b":["3404","3402","3408"]},"In embodiments, the RV module operates according to a rule book . The rule book comprises a set of instructions describing specific linguistic patterns relevant to a particular vertical market or horizontal discipline, such as patents. The rulebook tells the module what concepts and relationships to retrieve from the text documents.","In an embodiment, the rule book  includes rules to analyze patents. The rule book may include instructions to analyze patents according to the following key terms: assignee and inventor. When processing a group of patents (as shown in the example of ), the RV module  would analyze the patents in the group  to identify the assignees and the inventors of the patents. This information would then be displayed in step , as shown for example in .",{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0254","num":"0399"},"figref":"FIG. 35","b":["1","1","1","2","1","2","1","3","2","2"]},"An example of this module is ClearForest of New York, N.Y., although the invention is not limited to this example.","6.3. Patent Family Expand Features","This section describes features of the invention relating to processing patent families. A patent family is a collection of patent documents that are related to one another in some way. For example, a patent family may include a U.S. provisional application, a corresponding U.S. non-provisional application, a corresponding PCT application, and a Japanese patent that was filed from the PCT application.","Requirements","This section describes requirements needed to support the patent family features according to an embodiment of the invention.","Family Relationship Types\n\n","Unstructured Family Relationships\n\n","Structured Family Relationships\n\n","Family Definitions\n\n","Standard Family Definitions\n\n","Custom Family Definitions\n\n","Document Types\n\n","Family Report\n\n","Family Tree\n\n","Patent Family Expand\n\n","Patent Family Dedupe\n\n","While various embodiments of the present invention have been described above, it should be understood that they have been presented by way of example only, and not limitation.
