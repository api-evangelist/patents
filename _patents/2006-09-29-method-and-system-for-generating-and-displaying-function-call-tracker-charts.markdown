{"@attributes":{"id":"description"},"BRFSUM":[{},{}],"heading":["FIELD","BACKGROUND","SUMMARY","DETAILED DESCRIPTION"],"p":["Embodiments of the invention generally relate to the field of tracing. More particularly, the embodiments of the invention relate to generating and displaying function call tracker charts.","As application development projects are growing larger, tracing is becoming increasingly important. Tracing can be a very useful tool used primarily by software developers to isolate problems, for example, by tracking execution of program code. For example, when developing an application, developers trace the execution of methods or functions within certain modules to identify problems and\/or to determine if the program code may be improved. If a particular method takes an inordinate amount of time to complete, the developer may determine the reasons why and\/or change the program code to operate more efficiently.","Trace tools are proprietary application programs which use different techniques to trace the execution flows for an executing program. One technique, referred to as event-based profiling, tracks particular sequences of instructions by recording application-generated events as they occur. By way of example, a trace tool may record each entry into, and each exit from, a module, subroutine, function, method, or system component within a trace file (e.g., a time-stamped entry may be recorded within the trace file for each such event). Trace events may also be sent to a console or other output destination.","Conventional trace tools, however, are limited with tracing data from various systems, i.e., when dealing with tracing data of various structures. For example, conventional trace tools do not provide for integration of various trace files of different structures relating to different corresponding systems. This often leads to, at best, delay in reading of errors as the data has to be manually read and, at worst, misreading of errors or even loss of trace data. Tracing is particularly cumbersome when a development project involves a great number of systems, applications, components, modules, developers, and\/or multiple interfaces and services. Furthermore, conventional trace tools are limited in the way they display tracing information.","According to one embodiment, a method for generating and displaying function call tracker charts is disclosed. The method includes importing trace data at a database from a provider, tracking a plurality of factors associated with the trace data, and generating a first graph to represent each of the plurality of factors associated with the trace data.","Other embodiments are also disclosed. Further, the above attributes may be implemented using a computer program, a system, or an apparatus, or any combination thereof. These and other details of one or more embodiments of the present invention are set forth in the accompanying drawings and in the description below.","As used herein, references to one or more \u201cembodiments\u201d are understood as describing a particular feature, structure, or characteristic included in at least one implementation of the invention. Thus, phrases such as \u201cin one embodiment\u201d or \u201cin an alternate embodiment\u201d appearing herein describe various embodiments and implementations of the invention, and do not necessarily all refer to the same embodiment. However, they are also not necessarily mutually exclusive. Descriptions of certain details and implementations follow, including a description of the figures, which may depict some or all of the embodiments described below, as well as discussing other potential embodiments or implementations of the inventive concepts presented herein.",{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0025","num":"0024"},"figref":"FIG. 1","b":["100","104","122","136","146","122","136","146","152","156","104","104","122","136","146","120","122","136","146","122","136","146"]},"In one embodiment, CPT architecture  provides a mechanism for persisting and analyzing performance traces from various monitored systems , , . A performance trace refers to a special trace type that deals with performance issues of applications and program codes, such as like call durations, call stacks, memory consumption, amount of transferred data, and the like. CPT architecture  may consist of common data format, trace data providers, central analysis services, generic reports, and the like. CPT architecture  further provides a library that provides one or more APIs (e.g., CPT API) to give access to CPT files and database . A CPT API refers to an interface that allows for generation and persistence of performance trace data, which complies with the CPT format that is provided via CAS  and stored at CPT database , and manages various CPT processes as discussed elsewhere in this document. In one embodiment, a trace correlator is employed at CAS . A trace correlator includes an object that is used to analyze trace records, which are obtained from different, software components, physical locations (e.g., hosts) and at different times. A trace correlator helps define a semantic group, which is useful to understand how various traces belong together. Also, distributed statistics may be used that refer to a minimum performance trace, which continuously runs with a running system, such as monitored systems , , . It may be aggregated offline to statistical aggregates and analyzed with respect to performance, accounting, hardware sizing, system usage profiles, and the like.","CAS  is in communication with client . CAS  includes Mbean server  that is registered with CAS . Further, display application or user interface (UI)  (e.g., WebDynPro Runtime) is employed. In one embodiment, a program code is instrumented that creates trace data supplier to write performance trace data via CPT API - to database . Trace model  that is in communication with Mbean server  and database  allows accessing of trace data at database  via UI  by providing a merged trace data received from multiple monitored systems , ,  via corresponding trace data importers - located at central data provisioning . Trace model  also provides for filtering and aggregation of trace data. To allow for proper access and analysis of trace data originating from multiple sources , , , the trace data is converted into a common format or structure (e.g., CPT format, CPT structure, etc.) and provided to the user via client  further via UI .","Various modules and components are employed at monitored systems , ,  to facilitate tracing and for collection, processing, and exporting of trace data. For example, J2EE monitored system  includes trace file storage  and server node , which includes trace data supplier , model provider , writer API , and Mbean server . In one embodiment, model provider  is implemented as MBean registered to the local system MBean server  and allows the accessing of trace data from CAS . Trace file storage  is referred to as a CPT file that serves as a temporary storage for trace data at monitored system . Trace data supplier  is a source of trace data, while write API provides a CPT API for trace data writing and serves as a CPT tracer.","ABAP monitored system  include a Computer Center Management System (CCMS) agent  that allows CCMS to access trace data for the local ABAP system . The trace data is provided to CCMS agent  via trace file provider  and stored at trace file storage  and received using work process . The trace data is retrieved from ABAP monitored system  and exported to CAS  by performing RFC calls to CCMS via CCMS agent . The trace data is imported at CAS  via ABAP CCMS importer  and then stored at database . In one embodiment, a number of systems can be monitored and trace data from such systems may be provided to CAS  so that it can then be converted into and provided as a common CPT structure trace data for access and analysis by client . For example, a third party monitored system  is illustrated that includes various third party compatible functional modules and components to collect trace data and provide it to CAS . Such modules may include a third party trace data writer , a third party agent , and a third party trace storage  to perform their respective functions as with modules and components at other monitored systems , . Further, a third party importer  at CAS  is employed to import trace data from the third party monitored system .","In one embodiment, CPT architecture  provides a CPT format and correlation. The CPT format is CIM-compliant and provides a common format to perform traces to (1) define the type of data that is needed to analyze performance and\/or functional problems, (2) allow for common central storage of trace data at database , which provides a common mechanism for persistence, management, and analysis, and (3) provide for correlation. Correlation allows for grouping (e.g., correlating) of trace records that belong to a single logical transaction by introducing a correlation, which is an abstract object. CPT architecture  further provides for selective and centralized switch of tracing data for involved components and traces types and structures. In one embodiment, the CPT reports of trace data may be implemented using UI application framework , such as the WebDynpro framework. The trace data is stored at database  using trace model  implemented as Mbean and registered with Mbean server  of CAS . Trace model  provides trace data both as race trace records and aggregated data.","In one embodiment, a user activity triggers requests that are processed by various components at monitored systems , ,  and CAS . For example, a web request from client  is sent to a J2EE application server associated with J2EE monitored system . Similarly a request may be sent to other system, such as ABAP system  and any other third party system . Components at various systems , ,  produce different traces appropriate for analyzing several functional and performance problems. Abstract correlator objects are introduced to allow end-to-end analysis of applications and user activities that are processed by components running at various systems , , . Such correlator objects provide for combining performance and trace data from different origins, such as different system , , , (2) serializing the trace data over a network and transferring the trace data to CAS  via the metadata of various communication protocols, and (3) providing the trace data via a common structure to provide performance activities of applications, program codes, and user activities that are being monitored and analyzed.",{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0032","num":"0031"},"figref":["FIG. 2A","FIG. 1","FIG. 1","FIG. 1"],"b":["204","206","210","122","136","146","120","104","204","206","210","202","204","204"]},"CPT API  enables the currently existing functionalities in tracing (e.g., SQLTrace). Such functionalities include (1) reading trace data in an appropriate format for the corresponding application (e.g., OpenSQLMonitors application), (2) writing a trace record (together with metrics) is an atomic operation, (3) allowing the writing of trace data to a non database storage, and allowing the writing of trace data at server startup. Objects associated with CPT API  that are used for direct instrumentation of a trace data provider include (1) a factory object (e.g., CPTFactory) that is responsible for generating CPT provider objects via configuration, (2) a provider object (e.g., CPTProvider) which is used by the instrumented code to provide a lookup action and metric definition objects that are defined in the configuration thus identifying a single trace data provider, (3) a record object (e.g., CPTRecord) that is used as a main entity to be persisted via CPT API . Record objects contain performance information for measured action.","Each trace record that is received from various providers (e.g., monitored systems) is then configured to a common structure (e.g., CPT structure) and is stored at database . A CPT trace record may contain any number of metrics. Such metrics are valued from the instrumented code at data providers (e.g., monitored systems) and are assigned to the CPT trace record by calling a particular API method, such as an API addMetric( ) method. If necessary, an CPT trace record may be extended. CPT configuration may be separated in two parts: static configuration and dynamic (online) configuration. The two configurations may be regarded as two different use cases. A static configuration file may be part of CPT API  and used for such initialization of CPT API  so it can be directly used by the data providers by having the static configuration contain default CPT writer settings. Static configuration is also used to predefine certain objects, such as application layers, system layers, and database layers, etc. Also, the static configuration defines certain general metric definitions, such as elapsed time, central processing unit (CPU) time, and memory allocation that are relevant for various types of performance traces. A dynamic configuration file is part of the component that provides performance trace data. The dynamic configuration file may contain provider specific configurations, like actions and metric definitions.","In one embodiment, CPT API  is initialized by a J2EE engine service where the currently existing performance trace service is to be extended with various functionalities. The performance trace service provides various correlators, such as a measurement correlator that is regarded as the main correlator and is used to group up trace records belonging to a certain measurement or trace. The measurement correlator is referred to as the parent correlator to other correlators that are additionally provided. Another correlator includes a J2EE Engine runtime info correlator that contains information about the corresponding J2EE Engine user\/session\/application. The origin of CPT trace records is at a monitored system, such as at a node of a J2EE server associated with a J2EE system. To achieve a writing performance trace at server startup, a default correlator is employed for each virtual machine (VM). Default correlators may not contain any data relating to the monitored system. Further, for each trace data provider or monitored system, a default layer may be defined. The default layer is then automatically assigned to CPT trace records belonging to the corresponding trace data provider.",{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0036","num":"0035"},"figref":"FIG. 2B","b":["250","252","254","256","258","260","262"]},{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0037","num":"0036"},"figref":"FIG. 3","b":["300","304","304","302","334","336","334","336","304","310","304","310","310","306","302","310","306","302"]},"In one embodiment, trace data from J2EE and ABAP systems ,  is imported at CAS  via various module and components, such as a CPT API and importers (e.g., CPT importer , import module , etc.). CPT importer  is used to import data from J2EE monitored system  and place it at database . The files having the trace data are first saved at file system  before being imported into database . Import module  may be used to import trace data from ABAP monitored system  and from any other system (such as the third party monitored system  of ) and place it at database . For each ABAP trace, a reader class may be generated to be used to form an importer API of the CPT library. ABAP system  is in communication with trace manager  via RFC connector API . RFC connector API  serves as a proxy of RFC function modules and creates a general framework for connection to ABAP system . In addition to having and communicating with an ABAP system , a CCMS system  may also be added to CAS .","CAS  further includes configuration module  that contains methods for starting and stopping various trace activities, and for keeping general information (e.g., name, start data, end data, filters, etc.) about such activities. Configuration module  is in communication with configuration storage  where configuration data is stored. When a HyerText Transfer Protocol (HTTP) proxy is used on the client side, several XML files are generated as a result of that. These files are then uploaded to CAS  and with the help of a file (e.g., responses.trc file) that is generated by an HTTP service. Such HTTP analysis are generated and imported to CAS  via HTTP analysis module . Once trace activities are stopped and trace data form such activities are collected from monitored systems ,  and imported into database , the trace data may then be kept at analysis storage  and analyzed by analysis module .",{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0040","num":"0039"},"figref":"FIG. 4","b":["402","404","404","414","406"]},"At decision block , a determination is made as to whether the trace activity is to be deleted. If for any reason (e.g., incorrect application being traced, tracing data is correct, etc.), the trace activity at any given system is to be deleted at processing block , it is deleted and the process ends at termination block . This is can be accomplished by the user via the UI. In case of multiple trace activities, it is contemplated that one or more trace activities may be deleted, while still performing one or more other trace activities. If the trace activity is not to be deleted, the processing continues with collecting of trace data at the monitored system at processing block . When multiple trace activities are performed at multiple monitored systems, the trace data collected from each of those monitored systems may be of format and structure. For example, J2EE traces may be different in structure from ABAP traces. At processing block , the trace data is imported to a central database that provides a common structure of all trace data. The trace data having different structures is imported and converted into a common structure for the user to access and analyze at the central CPT database. This import may be performed via a number of CPT APIs, importers, import modules, temporary storages, and other modules and components. The process ends at processing block .",{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0042","num":"0041"},"figref":"FIG. 5","b":"500"},"In the illustrated embodiment, the database storage of trace data is shown as having various modules, records, etc. For example, a CPT-compatible trace data format or structure contains a stream of six files, such as (1) file origins, (2) file metrics, (3) file correlators, (4) file metadata, (5) file record correlator, and (6) file records. Each of the elements - illustrated here are contained in one or more such streams of files. For example, CPT metric definition , which contains unique identification, may be contained in file metrics, but repeated in file origins. CPT origin  includes a node from where a record (e.g., CPT record ) originates. CPT origin is found in file metadata and when combined with the unique identification from CPT metric definition  provides a global identification for the record . CPT module  provides the name of the logical unit (e.g., class name) corresponding to the record originated. CPT module  is contained in file metadata. CPT action , which is in communication with CPT module , provides the name (e.g., method name) of a module subsection which measures execution time.","CPT thread  provides a unique identification of the thread executing the module. CPT thread  is located in file metadata. CPT provider  is a provider of the record  and is contained in file metadata. Examples of trace data handled by a CPT provider  include SATrace, SQLTrace, APPTrace, etc. The providers, for example, may include SATrace, SQLTrace, APPTrace, etc. Based on the provider name, the visualizer can use plug-ins for additional processing. CPT record  includes the record that is originated, provided, and used and is associated with other elements -, -. CPT record  resides in file records. CPT record  may also include a parent identification which may be used when there is a nesting of trace records and may contain the identification of the parent record.","CPT metric  is located at file metrics. CPT metric  represents metrics having a set of (name=value) pairs giving additional information about a call. For example, CPT metric can describe a method call parameters, or in case of a database call, some database related values may be provided. These properties can be parsed by the visualizer to a provider specific plug-in or merely can be used as a more detailed description of the record . Trace data structure  further includes correlators, such as CPT record correlator  that resides at file record correlator, CPT correlator  that resides at file origins, and CPT correlator definition  that resides at file metadata. These correlators , ,  provide a value that defines and provides to which measurement or trace the record  belongs.
