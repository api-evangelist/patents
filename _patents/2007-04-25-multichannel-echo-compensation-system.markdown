Technical Field","This disclosure relates to echo reduction. In particular, this disclosure relates to echo reduction and suppression of residual echo signals in communication systems.","2. Related Art","Echo reduction or suppression may be needed in communication systems, such as hands-free sets and speech recognition systems. Communication systems may include a microphone that detects a desired signal, such as a speech signal from a user. The microphone may also detect undesirable signals, such as echoes produced by a loudspeaker.","Echoes may occur through the repetition of sound carried by the reflection of sound. Such signals may be detected by the near-end microphone and re-transmitted back to the remote party.","Multi-channel systems may have performance problems when individual channels have a correlation, which may occur when multiple microphones detect the speech from a speaker. When the individual channels are correlated, the adaptive filters may not converge to the desired impulse response. This may occur because portions of signals output by one loudspeaker may be compensated by a filter that processes the output of a different loudspeaker.","Optimization of echo compensation filters may depend upon the position of a speaker. Movement of the speaker may require recalculation of the filter coefficients. Filter convergence problems may result from the non-uniqueness of the adaptation calculations. Some approaches may delay the signals in individual channels and may introduce a non-linearity in the channel paths. These methods may introduce audible artifacts that reduce the quality of the speech signal. A need exists for an echo reduction system to reduce echoes in a multi-channel environment.","A multi-channel echo compensation system may receive first and second audio input signals from a first channel and a second channel of a multi-channel source device. A de-correlation processor may process the first and second audio input signals and generate first and second de-correlated audio signals. Loudspeakers may transmit the first and second de-correlated audio signals. A microphone may receive a desired and undesired signal. Adaptive echo compensation filters may filter the received signal on a channel-by-channel basis to generate an echo compensated signal. Adaptive echo compensation filters may remove the undesired signals.","Other systems, methods, features and advantages of the invention will be, or will become, apparent to one with skill in the art upon examination of the following figures and detailed description. It is intended that all such additional systems, methods, features and advantages be included within this description, be within the scope of the invention, and be protected by the following claims.",{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0021","num":"0020"},"figref":"FIG. 1","b":["110","120","124","124","120","110","120"],"sub":["1","2","1","2","1","2","1","2"]},"The de-correlation processor  may provide the de-correlated output signals {tilde over (x)}(n) and {tilde over (x)}(n) to devices that convert electric signals into sound.

Alternatively, the echo compensation filters  and  or DSP may be implemented as discrete logic or circuitry, a mix of discrete logic and integrated logic, or may be implemented through multiple processors or software programs.","The coefficients for the first and second channel echo compensation filters  and  may be dynamically adjusted separately for each channel. This may improve the quality of the microphone output signal y(n) and may improve the intelligibility of a speech signal detected by the microphone .","The de-correlation processor  may de-correlate the first and second channel acoustic input signals x(n) and x(n) based on the performance or the adaptation state of the echo compensation filters  and . If the controller  determines that the echo compensation filters  and  are not adequately adapting, the controller  may control the de-correlation processor  to de-correlate the first and second channel acoustic input signals x(n) and x(n). If the controller  determines that the echo compensation filters  and  are adapting at an acceptable rate, the controller  may instruct the de-correlation processor  to maintain or reduce an amount of de-correlation.","The quality and reliability of the echo compensated microphone signal e(n) may be enhanced by de-correlating the first and second channel acoustic input signals x(n) and x(n) dynamically in response to the adaptation state of the echo compensation filters  and . Artifacts that may have been introduced by de-correlation may be reduced to ensure intelligibility of echo compensated speech signals e(n).

A second summing or combining circuit  shown in  may combine the summed estimated output signal {circumflex over (d)}(n) and the microphone output signal y(n) to generate the echo compensated signal e(n). The summed estimated output signal {circumflex over (d)}(n) may be subtracted from the microphone output signal y(n).","The controller  may analyze the first and second channel acoustic input signals x(n) and x(n) to determine a correlation between the signals. If the correlation is below a predetermined threshold, the controller  may inhibit or deactivate the de-correlation processor . If the de-correlation processor  is deactivated, it may be programmed to function in a \u201cpass-through\u201d mode so that the de-correlated output signals {tilde over (x)}(n) and {tilde over (x)}(n) may be identical to the respective first and second acoustic input signals x(n) and x(n). If the correlation exceeds the predetermined threshold, the de-correlation processor may continue or may begin to de-correlate the respective acoustic input signals x(n) and x(n).","The controller  may receive information regarding the adaptation state of the first and second channel echo compensation filters  and  through first and second communication signals  and . The controller  may also receive the echo compensated signal e(n). The controller  may determine the adaptation performance of the echo compensation filters  and  based on a system distance measurement.

The degree of correlation may also be determined based on the short time coherence of the signals. De-correlating may be performed if the short time correlation or short time coherence, or their respective mean value, exceed a pre-determined threshold value.
