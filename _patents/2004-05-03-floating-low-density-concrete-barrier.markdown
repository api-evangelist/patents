title: Floating low density concrete barrier
abstract: A barrier for small boats has a plurality of flotation modules on lines extending across a waterway. The flotation modules are cast from a buoyant concrete mixture of cement, water, beaded forms of expanded polystyrene, and polypropylene fibers that is non-water-absorbing, crushable, not susceptible to failure in shear, and has a density lighter than water. The mixture can have cement with the beads in a ratio of about 1:3.5 by volume, the water with the cement in a ratio of about 0.5 (1:2) by weight and the fibers with the cement in a ratio of about 1:141 by weight. Lines pass thru the flotation modules and slip upon impact of a flotation module by a speeding boat, and the buoyant concrete mixture crushes to absorb some energy of the impact. The barrier is relatively low cost, can be made next to a waterway from readily available materials by unskilled workers and is deployed in a minimum amount of time.

{"@attributes":{"id":"description"},"GOVINT":[{},{}],"heading":["STATEMENT OF GOVERNMENT INTEREST","BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION","OBJECTS AND SUMMARY OF THE INVENTION","DESCRIPTION OF THE PREFERRED EMBODIMENT"],"p":["The invention described herein may be manufactured and used by or for the Government of the United States of America for governmental purposes without the payment of any royalties thereon or therefor.","This invention relates to a barrier for small boats. More particularly, the invention is to a cost effective floating barrier for small boats that is cast from low density concrete.","Marine facilities including ships are vulnerable to sabotage by explosive laden small boats. Different access-obstructing structures have been placed on the water with varying degrees of effectiveness.","One floating structure has a series of elongate, voluminous hollow water pipes sealed at their ends that are strung across an access way. Additional hollow pipes are welded to and across them for added buoyancy and to stabilize a partitioned wall held above the water that hopefully deters, or deflects encroaching small boats. This ponderous pipe structure requires a time consuming fabrication procedure at a distant heavy construction site and a significant and further time consuming logistical effort to get it to the water and launched. The time spent could leave a waterway unprotected during a critical period.","Another floating wall structure that floats on the water's surface uses interconnected thin-walled shells, or pontoon-like cylinders that may be rigid metal or inflatable flexible bags. While these cylinders may be easier to deploy on the surface of the water than the hollow water pipe structures, their fabrication can be labor and time intensive. Their construction suggests they might not survive the long-term rigorous effects an corrosion of waves, tides, and the other operational abuses they will be routinely subjected to, and consequently may need frequent inspection and maintenance.","A modification of the interconnected pontoon-like cylinder design has an upwardly extending metal framework supporting an exposed net that extends from one end to the other. In addition to requiring increased maintenance, the additional framework and net further complicate fabrication, and the extra time spent might delay deployment and leave a marine facility unprotected.","Thus, in accordance with this inventive concept, a need has been recognized in the state of the art for a cost effective, low maintenance easily fabricated barrier for deterring small boats from marine facilities.","An object of the invention is to provide a barrier to keep small boats away from marine facilities.","Another object of the invention is to provide a small boat barrier that is cost effective and can be quickly made near a deployment site by relatively unskilled workers.","Another object of the invention is to provide a barrier for small boats easily manufactured at a marine facilities site that allows for growth of marine organisms.","Another object of the invention is to provide a barrier for small boats having a capability for lights, sensors, and other payload to allow the barrier to be used as a floating platform.","Another object of the invention is to provide a barrier for small boats having sufficient mass to absorb the energy of an impacting small boat.","Another object of the invention is to provide a barrier for small boats made from a buoyant concrete mixture having a density of 35 to 50 lb\/ft.","Another object is of the invention to provide a barrier for small boats made from a buoyant concrete matrix moldable into a variety of shapes to allow barriers to be designed for a variety of applications.","Another object is to provide a barrier for small boats having lines passing thru and extending between serially arranged adjacent floating modules made from moldable buoyant concrete to transfer energy from one floating portion to the next to absorb energy from an impacting small boat or rough weather.","Another object is to provide a barrier for small boats having flotation modules with lines passing thru them with minimal gap between adjacent the flotation modules.","Another object is to provide a barrier for small boats not utilizing metal structure to reduce the problems otherwise associated with corrosive materials in salt water.","These and other objects of the invention will become more readily apparent from the ensuing specification when taken in conjunction with the appended claims.","Accordingly, the present invention provides a barrier for small boats. A plurality of flotation modules is cast from a buoyant concrete mixture of cement, water, beaded forms of expanded polystyrene, and polypropylene fibers that is non-water-absorbing, crushable, when compressed or impacted, causes local crushing not shear, and has a density lighter than water. One buoyant concrete mixture includes (weight=1562.5 pounds, volume=59.9 cubic feet, density=26.1 pounds per cubic foot) 1004 pounds of cement, 552 pounds of water, and 7 pounds of polypropylene fibers per volume of 48 cubic feet of polystyrene beads. The cement and water are mixed, then foam and beads at approximately 12 cubic feet of foam to 1.5 pounds of fiber are mixed into the cement\/water slurry. The mixture can have cement to beads at a ratio of 1:3.5 by volume, the water to cement ratio can be 0.5 (or 1:2) by weight and the fiber to cement ratio can be 1:141 by weight. Upon pouring, the mixture is pressed with approximately 0.1 psi pressure to remove air pockets and ensure the foam is encapsulated by the cement. Lines freely passing thru channels in the flotation modules and between the flotation modules form the barrier. The lines slip and give through the channels upon impact by a speeding boat and the buoyant concrete mixture crushes to absorb some energy of the impact. Barrier is relatively low cost and can be made next to a waterway from readily available materials by unskilled workers and deployed in a minimum amount of time.","Referring to , , and , a barrier  for small boats floats on water  and extends across a waterway surface  or along a perimeter  bordering marine facilities such as supply or fueling docks, warehouses, anchored ships, etc. that are to be closed to traffic from small boats. Barrier  has a sufficient number of cast flotation modules  on lines  extending through adjacent flotation modules  to reach across waterway surface  or along the length of perimeter  to anchoring systems . Anchoring systems  include an anchor  and lines  that are connected to lines  not only at opposite ends of barrier , but may be coupled to lines  along the length of barrier . Lines  and  can include stretchable nylon or other non-corrosive energy absorbing material or wire rope or chain to help absorb the energy of impacting craft. At least one resilient cushion structure  is interposed between adjacent flotation modules  to prevent them from knocking against each other and damaging themselves by motions caused by waves, currents and\/or impact by small boats.","An exemplary flotation module  shown herein has an elongate rectangular-shaped base section  and an elongate upright section  composed of an elongate rectangular-shaped portion  and a pair of elongate triangular portions . Elongate rectangular-shaped base section  and elongate rectangular-shaped upright portion  and pair of elongate triangular portions  of elongate upright section  can be cast as an integral unit or cast separately for ease of handling and joined together by conventional non-corrosive connective members  extending into them. An exemplary size for flotation modules  has section  being eight feet long, eight feet wide, and two-and one-half feet high, and portion  of section  extending four feet above the top of section  with portion  of section  reaching about two and one half feet above the top of section . This creates a wall extending at least four feet above the water line of each flotation module . It is understood that many other three-dimensional configurations for flotation modules  could be cast as desired, depending on the shapes of the molds.","Referring also to , flotation modules  are made from a buoyant concrete mixture . Flotation modules  can be quickly cast onshore  nearby waterway surface  by relatively unskilled workmen soon after notice is received that barrier  is needed. Each flotation module  can be made in a hollow mold  that can be differently configured to allow casting of different three-dimensional shapes in different sizes according to the task at hand and materials available.","Molds  can be quickly made from parts  of new or reclaimed lumber and\/or sheet stocks of metal or other compositions that are readily available or obtainable at virtually all shore based installations. Molds , only one of which is shown in , can be made of lumber parts  including planks and plywood sheet or other construction materials that can be nailed, bolted or otherwise held together. Mixed liquid buoyant concrete mixture  can fill mold  to the full extent of flotation module  through an open rectangular-shaped upper end  of mold .","Fabric straps or metal straps\/rods  can be placed around parts  to help hold them together. The added lateral holding force exerted by straps\/rods  may be needed to maintain the shape of mold  and hold the weight of the volume of liquid buoyant concrete mixture  that fills casting chamber  of mold . Hollow tubes , PVC tubes for example, or structural rods  can be cast into the concrete mix. Lines  can run through elongate channels  formed inside hollow tubes  or lines  can be attached to opposite ends of structural rods .","When liquid buoyant concrete mixture  cures and hardens, straps  and parts  of mold  can be rapidly disassembled. The cast and solid flotation module  can be transported over the relatively short distance from where it was cast onshore  and to where it is to be deployed on waterway surface  in barrier . Disassembled parts  and straps  can be quickly reassembled as mold  that again defines an empty casting chamber  for casting another flotation module . Thus, barrier  of the invention can be quickly fabricated onshore  as near to the site of deployment on water  as practicable, and, as compared to contemporary floating obstructions, the problems associated with making and moving the complicated and ponderous structures of the prior art are greatly reduced.","Concrete mixture  of flotation modules  has a density less than water to be buoyant and does not absorb water (after initial water absorption) to allow flotation module  to float at waterway surface  of water . Buoyant concrete mixture  of flotation module  is made to be crushable and is not susceptible to failure in shear, i.e., does not crack or shear when impacted by small boats. This capability absorbs and dissipates the energy of an impacting small boat to prevent an impacting craft from breaking through barrier . Buoyant concrete mixture  has no corrosive elements that would otherwise deteriorate in a corrosive salt water environment and needs little, if any, maintenance.","Buoyant concrete mixture  is buoyant and non-corrosive because of its unique mixed composition of cement , water , beaded forms of expanded polystyrene  and polypropylene fibers . Conventional concretes used for roadways, buildings, etc. are too heavy and tend to crack and fail in shear (without reinforcing rods or mesh) partially because they contain heavy, hard, inert aggregate. In comparison, buoyant concrete mixture  of the invention has non-water-absorbing polystyrene beads  and polypropylene fibers  to be buoyant and crushable without shearing-off to absorb some of the energy of an impacting craft.","Buoyant concrete mixture  has a density of between 35 to 50 pounds per cubic foot. This provides a sufficient mass density in flotation modules  of barrier  to absorb the energy of an impacting craft. The beaded forms of expanded polystyrene  are typically called \u201cregrind\u201d in the art since it is recycled polystyrene that has been shredded into bits. Other plastic-like compositions could be selected instead of the recycled polystyrene provided that the compositions are tough enough to be crushable, do not absorb water, do not crack or crumble in a shear-failure condition and have a density that is lighter than water. One commercially available composition that is suitable has been marketed under the trademark STYROFOAM by E.I. du Pont de Nemours and Company of Wilmington, Del. 19898. Furthermore, other fiber compositions could be used instead of polypropylene fibers  provided that the other compositions are tough enough to hold the cured buoyant concrete mixture  together as flotation module , are crushable in impact, resist failure in shear, do not absorb water and have a density that is lighter than water.","Glass micro-spheres may provide required flotation and structural requirements. However they may be too fragile to mix. In addition, they are too expensive for building enough flotation modules  for an extended barrier . Incorporation of the insulating material, heated and expanded perlite silicous rock, in place of polystyrene beads  in buoyant concrete mixture  is not acceptable since the perlite insulating materials absorb water and, consequently, would not provide the necessary amount of buoyancy for flotation modules  of the invention.","One exemplary composition for buoyant concrete mixture  for flotation modules  has one part cement  to three and one-half parts of polystyrene beads  by volume. This exemplary mix has 1004 pounds of cement , 552 pounds of water , and 7 pounds of polypropylene fibers  per volume of 49 cubic feet of polystyrene beads . The cement and water are mixed, then foam and beads at approximately 12 cubic feet of foam to 1.5 pounds of fiber are mixed into the cement\/water slurry. The mixing can have the cement and the beads in a ratio of about 1:3.5 by volume, the water and the cement in a ratio of about 0.5 (1:2) by weight and the fibers and the cement in a ratio of about 1:141 by weight. Upon pouring into molds, the mixture is pressed with approximately 0.1 psi pressure to remove air pockets and ensure the foam is encapsulated by the cement. This buoyant concrete mixture  has a density of 43 pounds per cubic foot, and after curing, can sustain a compression crush stress of about 150 pounds per square inch that fails by localized crushing and not by breaking (shearing). In other words, upon impact, the cured buoyant concrete mixture  of flotation modules  is impact resistant and crushes locally (at the point of impact) whereas typical contemporary concrete cracks and shears.","Flotation module  dimensioned as disclosed above and composed of buoyant concrete mixture  as described above can support a load of an additional 1700 pounds. This buoyancy allows for growth of marine life, and equipment and personnel can be supported on each flotation module . Since there is only cured buoyant concrete mixture , lines  and cushions  between adjacent flotation modules  and no corrosive metals or other degradable materials, maintenance is minimized.","A liquid slurry or matrix of mixed components , , , and  of buoyant concrete mixture  is moldable into a variety of shapes allowing flotation modules  of barrier  to be designed to also function as ship-to-shore ramps, access docks, etc. In addition to creating differently shaped barriers , different ones of flotation modules  can create stable platforms to attach lights, sensors, and other equipment. In addition to use as barrier , flotation modules  fabricated from buoyant concrete mixture  can have many applications including low cost floating breakwaters, house boats, floating piers, boat docks and jet-ski docks, for examples. Equipment can be added using standard masonry techniques. For example  shows PVC (or metal) pipes A, B that have been cast into base section . Pipes A, B have tubular openings  to receive and allow the addition of the leg-like PVC, or steel structural members  connected to signs, posts, net and equipment supports, etc. on flotation modules . Holes  in pipes A, B align with corresponding holes in structural members  to receive pins  and secure structural members  to flotation modules . Lateral parts  of pipe A are cast in base section  to make a stronger fitting by increasing the force needed to pull pipe A out of base section .","Lines  have been disclosed as freely passing thru elongate channels . This allows flotation modules  to slip along lines  and provide additional \u201cgive\u201d in barrier  to absorb or dissipate some of the energy of an impacting high speed boat or rough weather without increasing the load on flotation modules . Lines  extend only a relatively short distance between adjacent flotation modules  (where cushions  are located) so that an encroaching small boat will have to impact at least one flotation module  and not be able to slip between them. Lines  provide energy transfer from one flotation module  to the next, and as mentioned above, can be made from stretchable nylon or other strong partially resilient fiber to also absorb some of the energy of impact.","Referring to  a method  of making a floating barrier  calls for providing  a hollow mold structure . Providing  includes shaping  mold structure  to define an elongate rectangular-shaped base section  and shaping  mold structure  to define an elongate rectangular-shaped upright section . Next, method  call for proportioning  buoyant concrete mixture  of cement , water , beaded forms of expanded polystyrene , and polypropylene fibers  to have a density of less than water. Such proportioning  leads to creating  a density of buoyant concrete mixture  of flotation modules  in the range of thirty-five to fifty pounds per cubic foot.","Specifically proportioning  of constituents of buoyant concrete mixture  can be selecting  specific proportions that have 1004 pounds of cement , 552 pounds of water , and 7 pounds of polypropylene fibers  per volume of 49 cubic feet of polystyrene beads . Mixing  the proportioned buoyant concrete mixture , pouring  the mixed buoyant concrete mixture  in hollow mold structure  and compressing  mixture  by about 0.1 psi pressure to remove air and encapsulate the beads with concrete, allows curing  of the poured buoyant concrete mixture  into a solid flotation module  and the creating  of solid flotation module  to be crushable and not susceptible to failure in shear. The step of mixing  can also include mixing the cement with the beads in a ratio of about 1:3.5 by volume, the water with the cement in a ratio of about 0.5 (1:2) by weight and the fibers with the cement in a ratio of about 1:141 by weight. Molding  a plurality of flotation modules  that each have elongate channels , and passing  lines  through elongate channels  makes a low-cost, effective barrier  that can be selectively anchored.","Having the teachings of barrier , flotation modules , and buoyant concrete mixture  of this invention in mind, different applications, modifications and alternate embodiments of this invention may be adapted. The disclosed components and their arrangements as disclosed herein all contribute to the novel features of this invention. Barrier  of this invention is cost-effective, and is quickly made and deployed by relatively unskilled workers where it is needed. Numbers of flotation modules  made from buoyant concrete mixture  are relatively maintenance free and can be added as needed according to changing needs. Therefore, barrier , as disclosed herein is not to be construed as limiting, but rather, is intended to be demonstrative of this inventive concept.","It should be readily understood that many modifications and variations of the present invention are possible within the purview of the claimed invention. It is to be understood that within the scope of the appended claims the invention may be practiced otherwise than as specifically described."],"BRFSUM":[{},{}],"brief-description-of-drawings":[{},{}],"description-of-drawings":{"heading":"BRIEF DESCRIPTION OF THE DRAWINGS","p":[{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0021","num":"0020"},"figref":"FIG. 1"},{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0022","num":"0021"},"figref":"FIG. 2"},{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0023","num":"0022"},"figref":["FIG. 3","FIG. 2"],"b":["3","3"]},{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0024","num":"0023"},"figref":"FIG. 4"},{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0025","num":"0024"},"figref":"FIG. 5"}]},"DETDESC":[{},{}]}
