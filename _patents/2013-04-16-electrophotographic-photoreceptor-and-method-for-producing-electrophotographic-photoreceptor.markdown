Therefore, the diameter of the photoreceptors used for such image forming apparatus also becomes smaller and smaller. In addition, since a need exists for high speed and maintenance-free image forming apparatus, photoreceptors having good durability are desired. Specifically, a need exists for a photoreceptor, which has a good combination of abrasion resistance, scratch resistance and electric property and which can produce high quality images over a long period of time. It is known that a protective layer including a filler or a protective layer crosslinked by light or heat is used as an outermost layer of a photoreceptor to enhance the abrasion resistance and scratch resistance of the photoreceptor. In addition, the material used for a substrate of a photoreceptor preferably has good mechanical strength to prevent occurrence of a problem (scratch\/indentation problem) in that scratch or indentation is formed on the substrate in a photoreceptor production process or a maintenance operation of the photoreceptor due to handling errors. At the present time, aluminum alloys have been broadly used for substrates of photoreceptors because of having light weight and high electroconductivity while having a good combination of mechanical strength and processability.","However, substrates made of such an aluminum alloy tend to easily cause the above-mentioned scratch\/indentation problem and form dent. In addition, substrates preferably have good dimension stability to stably produce high quality images. Therefore, precision machining (such as precision cutting of surface of such substrates) is preferably performed on the substrates. In this case, the production costs of the substrates increase. In addition, manufacturing such aluminum alloys takes a huge amount of energy, and therefore the amount of emitted COis very large. Recently, from the environmental viewpoint, reduction of COemission is desired. Therefore, it is preferable to produce a substrate while reducing COemission. In attempting to solve the problems of such aluminum alloys, electroconductive resin substrates have been proposed. Such resin substrates have a light weight, and in addition by including a filler therein, a good mechanical strength can be imparted thereto, thereby making it possible to produce a substrate for photoreceptors, which has good resistance to scratch, indentation and dent. In addition, since manufacturing such resin substrates dramatically reduces COemission, the resin substrates are environmentally friendly.","Until now, various types of resin substrates have been disclosed, and examples thereof are as follows.","(1) Resin substrates prepared by molding an electroconductive resin including a thermoplastic resin such as polyamides and polyesters, and an electroconductive agent such as carbon black dispersed in the thermoplastic resin;","(2) A resin substrate prepared by molding an electroconductive resin including a thermosetting resin such as phenolic resins, and an electroconductive agent such as carbon black dispersed in the thermosetting resin.","(3) A resin substrate for which a crosslinkable phenolic resin is used as a main component and in which a carbon black is dispersed, wherein the substrate has an outermost layer having a resistance of not higher than 5\u00d710\u03a9, and wherein the purpose is to improve surface smoothness, electric properties, adhesion to photosensitive layers, and resistance to solvents and scratch.\n\n(4) A resin substrate for which a resol-type phenolic resin is used as a main component, wherein the purpose is to provide a substrate having a light weight, and a good combination of electroconductivity, nonmagnetism, heat resistance and dimension stability.\n\n(5) A resin substrate for which a polyamide resin prepared from metaxylylene diamine and adipic acid is used, wherein the purpose is to provide a substrate having a good combination of heat resistance, chemical resistance and mechanical strength.\n\n(6) A resin substrate for which a polyester resin is used, wherein the purpose is to provide a substrate having good dimension stability even under high temperature and high humidity conditions.\n\n(7) A resin substrate for which a mixture of a polyester resin and a polycarbonate resin is used, wherein the purpose is to provide a substrate having a good combination of chemical resistance, moldability, dimension stability, and adhesion to photosensitive layers.\n","As an aspect of the present invention, a photoreceptor is provided which includes a resin substrate including a resin and a carbon nanotube, and a photosensitive layer located overlying the substrate.","In this regard, \u201coverlying can include direct contact and allow for one or more intermediate layers.","As another aspect of the present invention, a method for producing a photoreceptor is provided which includes forming a resin substrate using a resin forming material including a carbon nanotube; and forming a photosensitive layer overlying the substrate.","The aforementioned and other aspects, features and advantages will become apparent upon consideration of the following description of the preferred embodiments taken in conjunction with the accompanying drawings.","Since the conventional resin substrates mentioned above in paragraph (1) are made of a thermoplastic resin, the resin substrates have poor heat resistance and poor dimension stability particularly under high temperature conditions. In addition, since the resin substrates have poor resistance to solvents such as alcohols and ketones which are typically used for forming photosensitive layers, the resin substrates are dissolved or swelled when contacted with a coating liquid including such a solvent, resulting in deformation of the substrates. Further, it is hard for the resin substrates to have a good combination of mechanical strength and electroconductivity.","The conventional resin substrate mentioned above in paragraph (2) has a good combination of solvent resistance and dimension stability because the substrate is subjected to a thermally hardening treatment, but has an insufficient mechanical strength. In order to enhance the mechanical strength, the resin substrate preferably includes a hardness improving agent such as inorganic or organic fillers. In addition, the resin substrate has to include an electroconductive agent. Namely, the resin substrate includes both a hardness improving agent and an electroconductive agent. In this regard, in order that the resin substrate has sufficient electroconductivity, the electroconductive agent has to be included in the substrate at a high concentration. In this case, the resin substrate has poor mechanical strength. In contrast, when a filler is included in the substrate at a high concentration in order to enhance the mechanical strength, the substrate has insufficient electroconductivity. Thus, it is difficult for the resin substrate to have a good combination of mechanical strength and electroconductivity.","In order that the conventional resin substrate mentioned above in paragraph (3) has a resistance not higher than 5\u00d710\u03a9, an electroconductive agent is preferably included in the substrate at a high concentration. In this case, the resin substrate has poor mechanical strength.","The conventional resin substrate mentioned above in paragraph (4) is similar to the photoreceptor according to an embodiment of the present invention because the resin substrate includes a phenolic resin, and it is difficult for the resin substrate to have a good combination of electroconductivity and mechanical strength.","It is difficult for the conventional resin substrate mentioned above in paragraph (5) to have high dimensional stability.","In addition, it is difficult for the conventional resin substrate mentioned above in paragraph (6) to have a good combination of mechanical strength and electroconductivity while having high dimensional stability.","Further, it is difficult for the resin substrate mentioned above in paragraph (7) to have good solvent resistance.","Thus, there is no conventional resin substrate, which has good durability (such as electric durability and mechanical durability) so as to be used for organic photoreceptors.","The problem to be solved by the present invention is to provide a resin substrate, which has a good combination of solvent resistance and electroconductivity and can maintain good dimensional stability when a photosensitive layer coating liquid is applied on the substrate and which is hardly scratched even when contacted with a device such as chargers, cleaners, and transferring devices. In addition, the substrate hardly causes plastic deformation even when stress is applied thereto by a device such as developing devices and cleaners in an image forming process. Further, the resin substrate hardly causes the above-mentioned scratch\/indentation and dent problems, and has good durability, and good dimension stability in a wide range of environmental conditions. Further, the photoreceptor using this resin substrate can produce high quality images and is environmental friendly because COemission can be reduced when manufacturing the photoreceptor.","The photoreceptor according to an embodiment of the present invention includes a resin substrate including a resin and an additive, which is dispersed in the resin and imparts a good combination of mechanical strength and electroconductivity to the substrate, wherein the resin is preferably a thermally-hardened resin. In this application, the term \u201ca hardened resin\u201d means a thermally-hardened resin of a thermosetting resin.","As mentioned above, the substrate used for electrophotographic photoreceptors preferably has a good combination of mechanical strength and electroconductivity. In order to enhance mechanical strength, for example, a hard material such as fillers is added thereto. In order to enhance electroconductivity, an electroconductive agent such as carbon black is added thereto. In this regard, when the added amount of a filler is relatively large compared to that of a carbon black, the electroconductivity of the resultant substrate deteriorates. In contrast, when the added amount of a carbon black is relatively large compared to that of a filler, the mechanical strength of the resultant substrate deteriorates. Namely, mechanical strength and electroconductivity establish a trade-off relationship.","Since carbon nanotube has a nano-structure and a high aspect ratio, carbon nanotube has excellent mechanical strength. In addition, carbon nanotube has electroconductivity not lower than that of carbon black. Therefore, by adding a carbon nanotube to a resin, a good combination of mechanical strength and electroconductivity can be imparted to the resin. However, since carbon nanotube has a needle form, electroconductivity of a resin decreases when the resin including a carbon nanotube is molded while oriented. In this regard, when a carbon black is included in a resin in combination with a carbon nanotube, electroconductivity of the resin can be dramatically enhanced without deteriorating mechanical strength of the resin. In addition, carbon nanotube has good solvent resistance.","Thus, the present inventors discover that by adding a carbon nanotube to a resin, a resin substrate for use in photoreceptors, which has a good combination of mechanical strength, electroconductivity and solvent resistance, can be provided.","The electrophotographic photoreceptor according to an embodiment of the present invention includes at least an electroconductive resin substrate, and a photosensitive layer located overlying the resin substrate, and optionally includes another layer.","The photosensitive layer may have a multi-layered structure or a single-layered structure.","The photosensitive layer having a multi-layered structure includes a charge generation layer having a charge generation function, and a charge transport layer having a charge transport function. The photosensitive layer having a single-layered structure includes a single photosensitive layer having both a charge generation function and a charge transport function.","The resin substrate of the photoreceptor of the present embodiment includes at least a carbon nanotube, and optionally includes a carbon black. Since the resin substrate includes a carbon nanotube, a good combination of mechanical strength and electroconductivity can be imparted to the resin substrate.","The photoreceptor of the present embodiment is characterized by having such an electroconductive resin substrate, and the layer structure and constituents of the photosensitive layer and other optional layers are not particularly limited. Namely, any known photosensitive layers and other layers can be used for the photoreceptor of the present embodiment.","Next, the layer structure of the photoreceptor of the present embodiment will be described by reference to drawings.",{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0036","num":"0035"},"figref":"FIGS. 1A-1C"},"The photoreceptor illustrated in  includes an electroconductive resin substrate , and a single-layered photosensitive layer , which is located on the resin substrate  and which has both a charge generation function and a charge transport function.","The photoreceptor illustrated in  includes the electroconductive resin substrate , an undercoat layer  located on the resin substrate , and the single-layered photosensitive layer , which is located on the undercoat layer  and which has both a charge generation function and a charge transport function.","The photoreceptor illustrated in  includes the electroconductive resin substrate , the single-layered photosensitive layer , which is located on the resin substrate  and which has both a charge generation function and a charge transport function, and a protective layer  (i.e., a crosslinked outermost layer), which is located on the photosensitive layer .",{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0040","num":"0039"},"figref":"FIGS. 2A-2C"},"The photoreceptor illustrated in  includes the electroconductive resin substrate , a charge generation layer , which is located on the resin substrate  and which has a charge generation function, and a charge transport layer , which is located on the charge generation layer  and which has a charge transport function.","The photoreceptor illustrated in  includes the electroconductive resin substrate , the undercoat layer  located on the resin substrate , the charge generation layer , which is located on the undercoat layer  and which has a charge generation function, and the charge transport layer , which is located on the charge generation layer  and which has a charge transport function.","The photoreceptor illustrated in  includes the electroconductive resin substrate , the charge generation layer , which is located on the resin substrate  and which has a charge generation function, the charge transport layer , which is located on the charge generation layer  and which has a charge transport function, and the protective layer  (i.e., a crosslinked outermost layer), which is located on the charge transport layer .","The electroconductive resin substrate  of the photoreceptor of the present embodiment includes a carbon nanotube, which is dispersed in a resin, and has a volume resistivity of not higher than 10\u03a9\u00b7cm. Thermoplastic resins and thermosetting resins can be used for forming the resin substrate. Specific examples of such thermoplastic resins include polyethylene resins, polypropylene resins, polystyrene resins, ABS (acrylonitrile-butadiene-styrene) resins, polyvinyl chloride, polycarbonate resins, polyamide resins, polyacetal resins, polybutylene terephthalate resins, and polyethylene terephthalate resins. Specific examples of the thermosetting resins include phenolic resins, urea resins, alkyd resins, melamine resins, epoxy resins, and polyurethane. Thermosetting resins are preferably used because the resultant thermally-hardened resins have a good combination of heat resistance and solvent resistance. Among thermosetting resins, phenolic resins are preferable because the resultant hardened resins have a good combination of mechanical properties, electric properties, chemical properties, heat resistance, and flame resistance while having relatively low costs. Particularly, phenolic resins have better mechanical strength and flame resistance than other thermally-hardened resins, and therefore phenolic resins are particularly preferable.","In this application, a material used for forming a resin of the resin substrate is hereinafter sometimes referred to as a resin forming material. Specific examples of the resin forming material include monomers, oligomers, polymers, precursors of resins, and thermosetting resins (which form thermally-hardened resins).","Phenolic resins are broadly classified into novolac-type phenolic resins, which are prepared by reacting a phenolic compound such as phenol, bisphenol A, xylenol, cresol and resorcinol with an aldehyde compound (such as formaldehyde) using an acid catalyst; and resol-type phenolic resins, which are prepared by reacting such a phenol compound with an aldehyde compound using an alkaline catalyst. Novolac-type phenolic resins have good dimensional stability, but generate ammonia. Therefore, when novolac-type phenolic resins are used for the resin substrate, it is possible that electric properties of the photoreceptor are deteriorated by the substrate. In contrast, since resol-type phenolic resins do not generate ammonia, resol-type phenolic resins are preferably used for the resin substrate.","Hexamethylenetetramine is typically used as a hardener when preparing novolac-type phenolic resins. The added amount of hexamethylenetetramine is generally from 5% to 20% by weight based on the weight of the novolac-type phenolic resin. In contrast, it is not necessary to use a hardener for resol-type phenolic resins.","One or more resin monomers and a carbon nanotube are mixed so that the carbon nanotube is dispersed in the monomers, and the mixture is subjected to molding such as injection molding and extrusion molding to form a cylindrical electroconductive resin substrate.","Carbon nanotube is a material, which is a tube made of one or more carbon networks having a six-membered ring structure, wherein when the tube is made of two or more carbon networks, the networks are coaxial. Particularly, multi-layered carbon nanotube has a good combination of mechanical strength, elasticity and electroconductivity.","In contrast, carbon black has a structure in which a few layers of carbon having a graphite structure (i.e., hexagonal-shape carbon) are overlaid while connected like a chain, and has a particle diameter of from a few nanometers to hundreds of nanometers. The physical properties of carbon black change depending on the particle diameter, structure and surface conditions, and by changing the production method and production conditions so that the properties change, the physical properties such as electroconductivity of carbon black can be controlled.","The content of the electroconductive agent (i.e., a mixture of a carbon nanotube and a carbon black) in the resin substrate is preferably from 1% to 55% by weight based on the total weight of the resin substrate. The content of the electroconductive agent is more preferably from 10% to 45% by weight in order to enhance the electroconductivity, the mechanical strength and the mechanical durability of the resin substrate.","Since carbon nanotube has extremely high mechanical strength while having good electroconductivity, carbon nanotube is very useful for the resin substrate. However, since carbon nanotube has a needle form, carbon nanotube tends to be oriented in a molding process. In this case, the electroconductivity of the resultant resin substrate deteriorates. In this regard, by adding a carbon black, particles of the oriented carbon nanotube are connected with the carbon black, thereby dramatically enhancing electroconductivity of the resin substrate. The weight ratio (CNT\/CB) of carbon nanotube (CNT) to carbon black (CB) in the resin substrate is preferably from 9.5\/0.5 to 0.5\/9.5, and more preferably from 9.0\/1.0 to 1.0\/9.0. When the weight ratio (CNT\/CB) is from 9.5\/0.5 to 0.5\/9.5, a good combination of electroconductivity and mechanical strength can be imparted to the resin substrate.","The electroconductive resin substrate can include an inorganic or organic filler other than carbon nanotube and carbon black to further enhance the mechanical strength of the substrate. Specific examples of such organic fillers include organic pigments such as phthalocyanine pigments, azo pigments, perylene pigments, anthraquinone pigments, polycyclic quinone pigments, quinoneimine pigments, diphenylmethane pigments, triphenylmethane pigments, benzoquinone pigments, naphthoquinone pigments, cyanine pigments, azomethine pigments, indigoid pigments, and benzimidazole pigments; wood powders, cellulose, and carbon fibers.","Specific examples of such inorganic fillers include metal oxides such as titanium oxide, silica, alumina, zirconium oxide, tin oxide, and indium oxide; and inorganic fibers such as glass fibers and ceramic fibers.","The content of such a filler in the resin substrate is preferably from 0% to 60% by weight based on the total weight of the substrate.","Other fillers such as magnesium oxide, magnesium carbonate, aluminum hydroxide, calcium carbonate, kaolin, white clay, and talc can be used. The content of such a filler in the resin substrate is preferably from 0% to 50% by weight based on the total weight of the substrate.","In order to further enhance electroconductivity of the resin substrate, it is possible that a metal such as aluminum, nickel, chromium, nichrome, copper, gold, silver and platinum; and\/or a metal oxide such as tin oxide, and indium oxide, are added to a resin monomer and then the mixture is subjected to molding. Alternatively, it is also possible to form an electroconductive layer on the surface of the electroconductive resin substrate by vapor deposition or sputtering using one or more of these electroconductive materials.","In addition, it is possible to coat the surface of the electroconductive resin substrate with a coating liquid including a binder resin and a particulate electroconductive material dispersed in the binder resin. Specific examples of such a particulate electroconductive material include carbon nanotube, carbon black, acetylene black, powders of a metal such as iron, nichrome, copper, zinc, and silver; and powders of a metal oxide such as electroconductive tin oxide, and indium tin oxide (ITO).","Specific examples of the binder resin used in combination with such a particulate electroconductive material include thermoplastic resins, thermosetting resins, and photo-crosslinking resins such as polystyrene, styrene-acrylonitrile copolymers, styrene-butadiene copolymers, styrene-maleic anhydride copolymers, polyester, polyvinyl chloride, vinyl chloride-vinyl acetate copolymers, polyvinyl acetate, polyvinylidene chloride, polyarylate, phenoxy resins, polycarbonate, cellulose acetate resins, ethyl cellulose resins, polyvinyl butyral, polyvinyl formal, polyvinyl toluene, poly-N-vinyl carbazole, acrylic resins, silicone resins, epoxy resins, melamine resins, urethane resins, phenolic resins, and alkyd resins.","Such an electroconductive layer is typically prepared by coating a coating liquid, which is prepared by dissolving or dispersing a binder resin in a solvent such as tetrahydrofuran, dichloromethane, methyl ethyl ketone, and toluene, and dispersing a particulate electroconductive material therein.","In addition, it is possible to form an electroconductive layer on the surface of the electroconductive resin substrate using a heat shrinking tube which includes a particulate electroconductive material (such as the materials mentioned above) and a binder resin such as polyvinyl chloride, polypropylene, polyester, polystyrene, polyvinylidene chloride, polyethylene, and TEFLON.","The electroconductive resin substrate of the photoreceptor of the present embodiment can be prepared by any known methods. For example, a method including adding a proper amount of carbon nanotube into a thermosetting resin together with an optional filler; mixing the carbon nanotube, the resin and the optional filler at room temperature using a mixer to prepare a composition; and molding the composition using an injection molding machine or an extruder, can be used.","When a cylindrical electroconductive resin substrate is formed, for example, injection molding and extrusion molding can be used. From the viewpoints of productivity and manufacturing costs, extrusion molding is preferable.","Any known extrusion molding methods can be used. For example, a screw extrusion molding method for molding a thermosetting resin disclosed in JP-H06-011514-B can be used.",{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0065","num":"0064"},"figref":"FIG. 3"},"A raw material  (such as a resin composition including a carbon nanotube, a thermosetting resin, and an optional filler), which is supplied from a hopper , is fed to an extrusion cylinder  of the extruder, and then subjected to melt-kneading by an extrusion screw . The melted and kneaded raw material is fed by the extrusion screw  to an extrusion die , thereby forming an electroconductive resin pipe  serving as a resin substrate.","The temperature of the extrusion cylinder  is generally from 50\u00b0 C. to 140\u00b0 C., and preferably from 60\u00b0 C. to 120\u00b0 C.","When the temperature of the extrusion cylinder  is lower than 50\u00b0 C., the hardening reaction of the resin composition is not sufficiently performed, and therefore it becomes hard to prepare a pipe having the desired properties. In contrast, when the temperature is higher than 140\u00b0 C., the resin composition is excessively hardened before reaching the extrusion die , thereby making it impossible to extrude the resin composition. The temperature of the extrusion die  is preferably higher than the temperature of the extrusion cylinder , and is generally from 120\u00b0 C. to 200\u00b0 C., and preferably from 140\u00b0 C. to 170\u00b0 C.","When the temperature of the extrusion die  is lower than 120\u00b0 C., the hardening reaction of the resin composition is not sufficiently performed, and therefore it becomes hard to prepare a pipe having the desired properties. In contrast, when the temperature is higher than 200\u00b0 C., the resin composition is excessively hardened before reaching the extrusion die , thereby making it impossible to extrude the resin composition.","The hardening temperature in extrusion molding depends on the thermosetting resin used, and is generally from 50\u00b0 C. to 200\u00b0 C. When the temperature is lower than 50\u00b0 C., the hardening reaction is not sufficiently performed, thereby making it impossible to prepare a molded substrate having the desired properties. In contrast, when the temperature is higher than 200\u00b0 C., the resin composition is excessively hardened before reaching the extrusion die , thereby making it impossible to extrude the resin composition.","When a thermoplastic resin is used for forming a cylindrical resin substrate, injection molding and extrusion molding can be used similarly to the case where a thermosetting resin is used. From the viewpoints of productivity and manufacturing costs, extrusion molding is preferable. The temperatures of the extrusion cylinder  and the extrusion die  are determined depending on the melting point of the thermoplastic resin used. When a popular polyamide resin is used, the temperature of the extrusion cylinder  is preferably from 240\u00b0 C. to 320\u00b0 C., and the temperature of the extrusion die  is from 80\u00b0 C. to 180\u00b0 C.","Next, the photosensitive layer will be described. The photosensitive layer may have a single-layered structure or a multi-layered structure.","The multi-layered photosensitive layer includes a charge generation layer having a charge generation function, and a charge transport layer having a charge transport function. The single-layered photosensitive layer has both a charge generation function and a charge transport function.","Each of the multi-layered photosensitive layer and the single-layered photosensitive layer will be described.","Initially, the multi-layered photosensitive layer will be described.","The multi-layered photosensitive layer includes a charge generation layer  having a charge generation function. The charge generation layer  includes as a main component a charge generation material having a charge generation function. Inorganic charge generation materials and organic charge generation materials can be used as the charge generation material.","Specific examples of such inorganic charge generation materials include crystalline selenium, amorphous selenium, selenium-tellurium compounds, selenium-tellurium-halogen compounds, selenium-arsenic compounds, and amorphous silicon. As for the amorphous silicon, amorphous silicon in which the dangling bond is terminated with a hydrogen atom or a halogen atom, or amorphous silicon which is doped with a boron atom or a phosphorous atom, can be preferably used.","Any known organic charge generation materials can be used as the charge generation material of the charge generation layer .

Among these materials, phthalocyanine compounds are preferable and titanylphthalocyanine compounds are more preferable. Among the titanylphthalocyanine compounds, Y-form titanylphthalocyanine compounds having an X-ray diffraction spectrum such that main peaks are observed at Bragg 2 \u03b8 angles of 9.6\u00b10.2\u00b0, 24.0\u00b10.2\u00b0, and 27.2\u00b10.2\u00b0 are preferable because of having high sensitivity.

Specific examples of the coating methods include dip coating, spray coating, bead coating, and ring coating.","The thickness of the charge generation layer is preferably from 0.01 \u03bcm to 5 \u03bcm, and more preferably from 0.05 \u03bcm to 2 \u03bcm.","The charge transport layer  is a layer having a charge transport function, and is typically prepared by applying a coating liquid, which is prepared by dissolving or dispersing a charge transport material having a charge transport function and a binder resin in a proper solvent, on the charge generation layer, followed by drying the coated liquid. The thickness of the charge transport layer is from 5 nm to 40 nm, and preferably from 10 nm to 30 nm.","Specific examples of the charge transport material to be included in the charge transport layer include the electron transport materials, the positive hole transport materials, and the charge transport polymers, which are mentioned above for use in the charge generation layer.","Specific examples of the binder resin for use in the charge transport layer include known thermoplastic resins, and thermosetting resins, such as polystyrene, styrene-acrylonitrile copolymers, styrene-butadiene copolymers, styrene-maleic anhydride copolymers, polyester, polyvinyl chloride, vinyl chloride-vinyl acetate copolymers, polyvinyl acetate, polyvinylidene chloride, polyarylates, phenoxy resins, polycarbonate, cellulose acetate resins, ethyl cellulose resins, polyvinyl butyral, polyvinyl formal, polyvinyl toluene, poly-N-vinyl carbazole, acrylic resins, silicone resins, epoxy resins, melamine resins, urethane resins, phenolic resins, and alkyd resins.","Solvents similar to the solvents mentioned above for use in preparing the charge generation layer coating liquid are used for the charge transport layer coating liquid, and one or more solvents capable of dissolving the charge transport material and the binder resin used for the charge transport layer are preferably used. Coating methods mentioned above for use in preparing the charge generation layer can be used for preparing the charge transport layer.","The charge transport layer coating liquid can optionally include an additive such as plasticizers and leveling agents. Specific examples of the plasticizers include plasticizers for use in resins such as dibutyltin phthalate, and dioctyltin phthalate. The added amount of a plasticizer is generally from 0% to 30% by weight based on the weight of the binder resin included in the charge transport layer coating liquid.","Specific examples of the leveling agents include silicone oils (such as dimethylsilicone oils, and methylphenylsilicone oils), and polymers and oligomers having a perfluoroalkyl group in their side chains. The added amount of a leveling agent is preferably from 0% to 1% by weight based on the weight of the binder resin included in the charge transport layer coating liquid.","Next, the single-layered photosensitive layer  will be described.","The single-layered photosensitive layer  is typically prepared by applying a coating liquid which is prepared by dissolving or dispersing a charge generation material having a charge generation function, a charge transport material having a charge transport function, and a binder resin in a proper solvent; and then drying the applied liquid. The coating liquid optionally includes an additive such as plasticizers and leveling agents. The above-mentioned dispersing method for dispersing a charge generation material can be used for forming the photosensitive layer, and the charge generation material, the charge transport material, the plasticizer, and the leveling agent are described above when describing the charge generation layer and the charge transport layer can be used for the photosensitive layer. With respect to the binder resin, one or more of the binder resins mentioned above for use in preparing the charge generation layer can be used in combination with one or more of the binder resins mentioned above for use in preparing the charge transport layer. The thickness of the charge transport layer is generally form 5 \u03bcm to 30 \u03bcm, and preferably from 10 \u03bcm to 25 \u03bcm.","Next, the undercoat layer  will be described. The photoreceptor of the present embodiment can have the undercoat layer  between the electroconductive resin substrate  and the photosensitive layer such as the charge generation layer  or the single-layered photosensitive layer .","The undercoat layer includes a resin as a main component. Since the photosensitive layer is formed on the undercoat layer typically by coating a coating liquid including an organic solvent, the resin in the undercoat layer preferably has good resistance to general organic solvents. Specific examples of such resins include water-soluble resins such as polyvinyl alcohol resins, casein and polyacrylic acid sodium salts; alcohol soluble resins such as nylon copolymers and methoxymethylated nylons; and hardening resins capable of forming a three-dimensional network such as polyurethane resins, melamine resins, phenolic resins, alkyd-melamine resins, and epoxy resins. In addition, the undercoat layer can include a metal oxide powder to prevent formation of moir\u00e9 in the resultant images and to decrease the potential of irradiated portions (i.e., residual potential) of the resultant photoreceptor. Specific examples of the metal oxides include titanium oxide, silica, alumina, zirconium oxide, tin oxide, and indium oxide.","The undercoat layer is typically formed by applying a coating liquid including a resin, an optional particulate material, and a proper solvent using a proper coating method such as the coating methods mentioned above for use in preparing the charge generation layer and the charge transport layer. The undercoat layer may be formed using a silane coupling agent, a titanium coupling agent, or a chromium coupling agent. In addition, a layer of aluminum oxide which is formed by an anodic oxidation method, and a layer of an organic compound such as polyparaxylylene and an inorganic compound such as SiO, SnO, TiO, ITO and CeO, which is formed by a vacuum evaporation method, can also be preferably used as the undercoat layer. However, the undercoat layer is not limited thereto, and any known undercoat layers can be used. The thickness of the undercoat layer is preferably 0 to 5 \u03bcm.","Next, the protective layer  will be described. The photoreceptor of the present embodiment can include the protective layer  as the outermost layer thereof. The protective layer  includes a resin as a main component. Specific examples of the resin include acrylonitrile-butadiene-styrene resins (ABS resins), acrylonitrile-chlorinated polyethylene-styrene resins (ACS resins), olefin-vinyl monomer copolymers, chlorinated polyether, aryl resins, phenolic resins, polyacetal, polyamide, polyamideimide, polyacrylate, polyarylsulfone, poybutylene, polybutylene terephthalate, polycarbonate, polyarylate, polyethersulfone, polyethylene, polyethylene terephthalate, polyimide, acrylic resins, polymethylpentene, polypropylene, polyphenylene oxide, polysulfone, polystyrene, acrylonitrile-styrene resins (AS resins), butadiene-styrene copolymers, polyurethane, polyvinyl chloride, polyvinylidene chloride, and epoxy resins. Among these resins, polycarbonate and polyarylate are preferable.","In order to enhance the abrasion resistance of the protective layer , a resin such as fluorine-containing resins and silicone resins can be used for the protective layer. In this regard, a filler such as inorganic fillers (e.g., tin oxide, potassium titanate, and silica), and organic fillers may be dispersed in the resin. Specific examples of such organic fillers include powders of fluorine-containing resins such as polytetrafluoroethylene, powders of silicone resins, and powders of amorphous carbon. Specific examples of the inorganic filler include powders of metals such as copper, tin, aluminum, and indium, and powders of inorganic materials such as metal oxides (e.g., silica, tin oxide, zinc oxide, titanium oxide, indium oxide, antimony oxide, bismuth oxide, antimony-doped tin oxide, and tin-doped indium oxide), and potassium titanate.","Among these fillers, inorganic fillers are preferable from the viewpoint of hardness. Particularly, silica, titanium oxide and alumina are preferable.","The content of a filler in the protective layer  is determined based on the property of the filler used, and the process conditions of the image forming apparatus for which the photoreceptor is used. However, the content of a filler in the surface portion of the protective layer is not less than 5% by weight, and preferably not less than 10% by weight, based on the total weight of the solid components included in the protective layer. The content of a filler is generally not greater than 50% by weight, and preferably not greater than 30% by weight.","In order to reduce the residual potential of the photoreceptor and to enhance the response of the photoreceptor, the protective layer  can include a charge transport material.","Specific examples of the charge transport material include the charge transport materials mentioned above for use in the charge transport layer. When a low molecular weight charge transport material is used, the layer may have a gradient-like concentration of the charge transport material in the depth direction. In this case, it is preferable that the layer has a gradient-like concentration of the charge transport material such that the concentration of the charge transport material at the surface of the protective layer is lower than that at the bottom of the protective layer. In this regard, the concentration means the weight ratio of the low molecular weight charge transport material to the total weight of the materials constituting the protective layer.","The protective layer is typically prepared by using a coating method. The thickness of the protective layer is generally from 0.1 \u03bcm to 10 \u03bcm.","The protective layer may be a protective layer having a crosslinked structure. Such a crosslinked protective layer is typically prepared by subjecting one or more reactive monomers having plural crosslinkable functional groups in a molecule to a crosslinking reaction using light or heat energy so that the protective layer can have a three-dimensional network. The thus prepared three-dimensional network serves as a binder resin, and thereby a high abrasion resistance can be imparted to the protective layer. In this regard, it is preferable that all or some of the reactive monomers have a charge transport function, because a charge transport portion is formed in the network, and thereby the function of the protective layer can be fully fulfilled. Specific examples of the monomer having a charge transport function include reactive monomers having a triarylamine structure.","A protective layer having such a three dimensional network has good abrasion resistance, but often causes large volume contraction in the crosslinking reaction. Therefore, when such a protective layer is too thick, cracks tend to be formed therein. In order to prevent formation of cracks, the protective layer may have a multi-layered structure such that a crosslinked protective layer is located on a protective layer in which a low molecular weight charge transport material is dispersed in a polymer.","Among various crosslinked protective layers, the following crosslinked protective layer is preferable.","Specifically, a crosslinked protective layer prepared by subjecting a radically polymerizable tri- or more-functional monomer having no charge transport structure and a radically polymerizable monofunctional monomer having a charge transport structure to a crosslinking reaction is preferable. Since the crosslinked structure is prepared by using a radically polymerizable monomer having three or more functional groups, the crosslinked structure has a well-developed three dimensional network. Therefore, the protective layer has a high crosslinkage density, high hardness, and high elasticity while having uniform surface. Therefore, a good combination of abrasion resistance and scratch resistance can be imparted to the photoreceptor.","In addition, a layer of amorphous carbon or amorphous silicon carbide prepared by a vacuum thin film forming method can also be used as the protective layer .","The photoreceptor of the present embodiment can have an intermediate layer between the photosensitive layer (such as the single-layered photosensitive layer  or the charge transport layer ) and the protective layer . The intermediate layer includes a binder resin as a main component.","Specific examples of the resin include polyamide, alcohol-soluble nylon, water-soluble polyvinyl butyral, polyvinyl butyral, and polyvinyl alcohol.","The intermediate layer is typically prepared by such a coating method as mentioned above. The thickness of the intermediate layer is generally from 0.05 \u03bcm to 2 \u03bcm.","In order to enhance stability of the photoreceptor to withstand environmental conditions, particularly, to prevent deterioration of photosensitivity and increase of residual potential, each of the layers such as the protective layer, the charge generation layer, the charge transport layer, and the undercoat layer can include an antioxidant.","Suitable antioxidants for use in the layers of the photoreceptor include the following compounds, but are not limited thereto.","Phenolic Compounds","2,6-Di-t-butyl-p-cresol, butylated hydroxyanisole, 2,6-di-t-butyl-4-ethylphenol, stearyl-\u03b2-(3,5-di-t-butylphenol-4-hydroxyphenyl)propionate, 2,2\u2032-methylene-bis-(4-methyl-6-t-butylphenol), 2,2\u2032-methylene-bis-(4-ethyl-6-t-butylphenol), 4,4\u2032-thiobis-(3-methyl-6-t-butylphenol), 4,4\u2032-butylidenebis-(3-methyl-6-t-butylphenol), 1,1,3-tris-(2-methyl-4-hydroxy-5-t-butylphenyl)butane, 1,3,5-trimethyl-2,4,6-tris(3,5-di-t-butyl-4-hydroxybenzyl)benzene, tetrakis-[methylene-3-(3\u2032,5\u2032-di-t-butyl-4\u2032-hydroxyphenyl)propionate]methane, bis[3,3\u2032-bis(4\u2032-hydroxy-3\u2032-t-butylphenyl)butyric acid]glycol ester, and tocopherol compounds.","Paraphenylenediamine Compounds","N-Phenyl-N\u2032-isopropyl-p-phenylenediamine, N,N\u2032-di-sec-butyl-p-phenylenediamine, N-phenyl-N-sec-butyl-p-phenylenediamine, N,N\u2032-di-isopropyl-p-phenylenediamine, and N,N\u2032-dimethyl-N,N\u2032-di-t-butyl-p-phenylenediamine.","Hydroquinone Compounds","2,5-Di-t-octylhydroquinone, 2,6-didodecylhydroquinone, 2-dodecylhydroquinone, 2-dodecyl-5-chlorohydroquinone, 2-t-octyl-5-methylhydroquinone, and 2-(2-octadecenyl)-5-methylhydroquinone.","Organic Phosphorus-Containing Compounds","Triphenylphosphine, tri(nonylphenyl)phosphine, tri(dinonylphenyl)phosphine, tricresylphosphine, and tri(2,4-dibutylphenoxy)phosphine.","Since these compounds are known as antioxidants for rubbers, plastics, oils and fats, the compounds can be commercially available.","The content of such an antioxidant in the layers is generally from 0.01% to 10% by weight based on the total weight of the layer.","Having generally described this invention, further understanding can be obtained by reference to certain specific examples which are provided herein for the purpose of illustration only and are not intended to be limiting.
