{"@attributes":{"id":"description"},"BRFSUM":[{},{}],"heading":["PRIORITY CLAIM","SUMMARY","BACKGROUND","DETAILED DESCRIPTION OF THE DISCLOSED EMBODIMENTS"],"p":["This patent application is a U.S. National Phase of International Patent Application No. PCT\/EP2013\/065654, filed 24 Jul. 2013, which claims priority to German Patent Application Nos. 10 2012 021 193.7, filed 30 Oct. 2012, and 10 2012 023 481.3, filed 30 Nov. 2012, the disclosures of which are incorporated herein by reference in their entirety.","Illustrative embodiments relate to a navigation apparatus for the spatial representation of a digital map detail around a geographical position on the earth's surface on the basis of digital geodata, wherein the digital geodata have height information.","Navigation apparatuses for displaying journey or flight routes are known. Such navigation apparatuses generally comprise a display apparatus that can be used to represent a detail from a map or road map on the basis of digital geodata, or topographical data. Usually, the display essentially shows the course of the roads and paths within the presented map detail and also features of the surroundings, such as outlines of adjoining buildings, localities or wooded areas. Conventionally, three-dimensional geodata can be represented in two dimensions using navigation systems, but known representations of this kind do not give the impression of spatial plasticity.","There is, therefore, a need to provide a navigation apparatus having an improved display that provides the user with a fully-fledged spatially realistic perception of the displayed map section.","According to at least one disclosed embodiment, a navigation apparatus for the spatial representation of a digital map detail around a geographical position on the earth's surface on the basis of digital geodata is provided. In this case, the digital geodata or topographical data have not only two-dimensional coordinates or position statements but additionally also height information. According to exemplary embodiments, the navigation apparatus comprises a first input interface for the digital geodata, a second input interface for coordinates or position statements for the geographical position and a third input interface for a perspective stipulation variable that corresponds to a desired viewing direction to the position. In addition, the navigation apparatus comprises a processor module that is coupled to the first, second and third input interfaces. In this case, the processor module is set up or customized, on the basis of the perspective stipulation variable and the geographical position, to ascertain or compute a coordinate transformation of the geodata that corresponds to the desired viewing direction. In addition, the processor module is set up or customized to associate different visual perception values with the geodata for different topological height values to obtain a visually differently perceptible or notionally plastic projection of the geodata that corresponds to the height information. In addition, the navigation apparatus comprises an output interface, coupled to the processor module, for outputting output data that correspond to the visually differently perceptible projection of the geodata that corresponds to the height information.","In other words, the processor module may be designed, for example by means of suitable programming and\/or electrical connection, to take the input data obtained via the first, second and third input interfaces as a basis for altering or complementing the digital geodata such that spatial plasticity that is perceptible to a viewer of a display is obtained for an electronic navigation map that is based on the output data.","According to exemplary embodiments, the first input interface may be implemented, for example, as an access device for accessing an electronic storage medium, particularly a CD-ROM, DVD-ROM or hard disk memory that stores the digital geodata. The second input interface can be used to read in the coordinates of the geographical position of interest. In this case, the geographical position relates to a current position of a vehicle in which the navigation apparatus may be embedded, for example. In this case, the geographical position as a current vehicle position can be ascertained by means of a GPS device (GPS=Global Positioning System), for example, and transferred to the processor module via the second input interface. The geographical position may alternatively be a desired destination position specified by the user. The third input interface can be used by the user to input a desired viewing direction or a desired virtual viewing height, that is to say to stipulate a perspective from which the user wishes to view the geographical position on the electronic or digital map. It is thus possible for the user to stipulate that he wishes to view roads and the surroundings thereof from a desired virtual height, for example, 100 m above the vehicle. On the basis of the stipulated perspective and the geographical position, the processor module ascertains a coordinate transformation or projection for the digital geodata that corresponds to the desired viewing direction. In this case, the digital geodata can be converted into a notionally perspective 2D or 3D view\u2014depending on the format of the original digital geodata\u2014by the processor module using image reproduction techniques through scaling, rotation and displacement. In addition, the processor module associates different visual perception values for different topological height values with the geodata transformed or projected on the basis of the stipulated perspective. In this way, the output data that code a visually differently perceptible projection of the geodata that corresponds to the height information are obtained. The output data obtained in this manner can be output by an output interface to a display apparatus for displaying the edited geodata in a notionally plastic map.","The cited navigation apparatus for the spatial representation of a digital map detail can be used to provide a user with a plastic representation of the roads and buildings surrounding him and of the terrain relief surrounding him on a display apparatus, particularly on a navigation display, as a result of which the user is able to assess his surroundings in an improved manner. Such a representation is useful particularly with a vehicle that is traveling at high speed or when visual conditions are poor.","According to some exemplary embodiments, a navigation apparatus for the spatial representation of a digital map detail can involve the digital geodata having two-dimensional geodata plus associated height values. These may be what are known as 2\u00bdD or 2.5D data, for which every point in the represented map section has a height stated in addition to two-dimensional x and y or length and width coordinates. The 2.5D representation is particularly suitable for providing a perspective or plastic virtual-3D map representation of the map detail. However, vertical walls and overhangs cannot be modeled in this way. In the case of 2\u00bdD geodata, the processor module may be set up or customized, on the basis of the perspective stipulation variable, that is to say the virtual height statement, for example, and the geographical position, to ascertain a two-dimensional coordinate transformation or projection for the two-dimensional geodata that corresponds to the desired viewing direction, and to associate different visual perception values to the two-dimensional geodata for different topographical height values, which perception values result in the plastic viewing effect despite a representation of the transformed geodata that is still two-dimensional.","According to some exemplary embodiments, the digital geodata can also be present in genuinely three-dimensional form, i.e. with three-dimensional x, y and z coordinates. In such cases, the navigation apparatus may additionally also have a fourth input interface for at least one light source stipulation variable that corresponds to a desired virtual light source. In such cases, the processor module may be set up or customized, on the basis of the perspective stipulation variable and the geographical position, to ascertain a three-dimensional coordinate transformation or projection of the geodata that corresponds to the desired viewing direction. In addition, the processor module may be set up or customized to associate different visual perception values with the three-dimensional geodata for different topographical or topological height values and to associate different light and shade regions with the resultant three-dimensional projection of the geodata on the basis of the light source stipulation variable.","The fourth input interface of the navigation apparatus can be used to read in input data that model a virtual light source. In this case, these input data are represented as a light source stipulation variable, for example, a vector. The light source stipulation variable can comprise statements about the height, the angle and\/or the direction of the light source relative to the geographical position. A combination of the variables obtained via the four input interfaces, particularly the height information, the perspective stipulation variable, predetermined visual perception values for the plasticity and the light source stipulation variable, allows a fully-fledged spatially realistic perception to be produced for the user.","Optionally, a navigation apparatus for the spatial representation of a digital map detail according to one exemplary embodiment can have the processor module designed or set up to provide, for a viewing direction that corresponds to an observation point behind and above the geographical position, a virtual horizon region in a region of the digital map detail that becomes free as a result of the coordinate transformation or the perspective tilt of the original geodata in a display region of the geodata. This is intended to be understood to mean a display region that is obtained as a result of tilting or rotation, corresponding to the coordinate transformation, of the original geodata from a pure plan view. A pure plan view, particularly of two-dimensional geodata, does not allow a notionally plastic representation. According to exemplary embodiments, the geodata are therefore tilted or rotated, e.g. by a central projection. The tilting then results in a freed image region that is no longer required for displaying the tilted data. This image region can therefore be provided with a horizon region, for example by means of corresponding coloring, to enhance the plastic impression. By providing a horizon region in the digital map detail, it is possible to achieve a natural and realistic representation of the horizon that conveys a visual appearance of a curvature of the earth.","To produce the plastic impression, a navigation apparatus for the spatial representation of the digital map detail according to one exemplary embodiment can have the processor module customized or set up to associate a first digital color code with the digital geodata for a first topological height value and to associate a second digital color code with the digital geodata for a second, possibly adjacent, height value, the second digital color code may differ from the first digital color code only slightly. Hence, different color codes can be provided as visual perception values for different topological height values, which different color codes, in combination with the stipulated perspective stipulation variable, produce a perceptible plasticity for a navigation map. In this case, color codes that are associated with adjacent discrete height values can, according to exemplary embodiments, differ only slightly to obtain a \u201csoft\u201d transition between adjacent height values. Thus it becomes possible to convey the overall impression of a sometimes only two-dimensional navigation map with height differences without the complex technical implementation of an actual three-dimensional height model. A combination of the color gradations, stipulated by the color code, for the representation of the various topological heights and if need be with the light source stipulation variable additionally allows a light and shade interaction to be produced on height models and 3D building models, which conveys a spatially realistic perception of the navigation map.","The color code used may be an RGB color space, for example, which simulates the color perceptions as an additive color space by means of additive mixing of three primary colors, red, green and blue. Other color codes, such as the CMYK color model, can likewise be used for the color representation of different height values.","It is also possible to use textures defined by means of a texture code, i.e. images or patterns that are on the surface of the objects to be mapped. In this case, a navigation apparatus for the spatial representation of a digital map detail according to one exemplary embodiment can have the processor module customized or set up to associate a first digital texture code with the digital geodata for a first height value and to associate a second digital texture code with the digital geodata for a second height value. The use of different textures for representing different topological height values is particularly advantageous for users with a color weakness.","Since the computation of the visual perception values for different topological height values by the processor module can result in a high level of computation complexity, it is possible, according to some exemplary embodiments, to use statically defined lookup tables that store digital visual perception values that correspond to different height values. It is therefore optionally possible for a navigation apparatus for the spatial representation of a digital map detail according to one exemplary embodiment to have an electronic memory area with a lookup table stored therein that stores digital visual perception values that correspond to different height values.","The static storage of visual perception values that correspond to different height values means that complex computations and accordingly a high level of memory consumption are avoided in the course of ascertaining the visually differently perceptible projection of the geodata that corresponds to the height information. Use of lookup tables is found to be particularly advantageous, particularly in the case of quickly changing surroundings, for example at high speed of travel, when the map detail needs to be updated quickly.","Optionally, a navigation apparatus for the spatial representation of a digital map detail according to one exemplary embodiment can have the lookup table storing color codes that correspond to different height values, wherein an association for a day representation of the digital map detail with two-dimensional (or 2.5D) geodata can be made according to the following association of RGB values with topological height values:",{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0042","num":"0041"},"tables":{"@attributes":{"id":"TABLE-US-00001","num":"00001"},"table":{"@attributes":{"frame":"none","colsep":"0","rowsep":"0"},"tgroup":{"@attributes":{"align":"left","colsep":"0","rowsep":"0","cols":"5"},"colspec":[{"@attributes":{"colname":"1","colwidth":"14pt","align":"left"}},{"@attributes":{"colname":"2","colwidth":"42pt","align":"center"}},{"@attributes":{"colname":"3","colwidth":"56pt","align":"center"}},{"@attributes":{"colname":"4","colwidth":"49pt","align":"center"}},{"@attributes":{"colname":"5","colwidth":"56pt","align":"center"}}],"thead":{"row":[{"entry":{"@attributes":{"namest":"1","nameend":"5","align":"center","rowsep":"1"}}},{"entry":[{},"Height","R","G","B"]},{"entry":{"@attributes":{"namest":"1","nameend":"5","align":"center","rowsep":"1"}}}]},"tbody":{"@attributes":{"valign":"top"},"row":[{"entry":[{},"\u200250 \u00b1 50","187 \u00b1 30%\u2002","206 \u00b1 30%","176 \u00b1 30%\u2002"]},{"entry":[{},"100 \u00b1 50","173 \u00b1 30%\u2002","188 \u00b1 30%","165 \u00b1 30%\u2002"]},{"entry":[{},"\u2002200 \u00b1 100","143 \u00b1 30%\u2002","166 \u00b1 30%","139 \u00b1 30%\u2002"]},{"entry":[{},"\u2002500 \u00b1 200","97 \u00b1 30%","124 \u00b1 30%","100 \u00b1 30%\u2002"]},{"entry":[{},"1000 \u00b1 500","77 \u00b1 30%","\u200295 \u00b1 30%","80 \u00b1 30%"]},{"entry":[{},"1500 \u00b1 500","62 \u00b1 30%","\u200275 \u00b1 30%","70 \u00b1 30%"]},{"entry":[{},"2000 \u00b1 500","54 \u00b1 30%","\u200258 \u00b1 30%","58 \u00b1 30%"]},{"entry":[{},"3000 \u00b1 500","88 \u00b1 30%","\u200287 \u00b1 30%","69 \u00b1 30%"]},{"entry":[{},"4000 \u00b1 500","127 \u00b1 30%\u2002","126 \u00b1 30%","99 \u00b1 30%"]},{"entry":{"@attributes":{"namest":"1","nameend":"5","align":"center","rowsep":"1"}}}]}}}}},"For example, the height statement can involve metric statements, such as mm, cm, dm, m or km.

In particular, the first input interface  is also used to read in height information or values for the region of the earth's surface that is represented in the digital map detail. According to exemplary embodiments, the digital geodata are thus at least what are known as 2\u00bdD or 2.5D data. In comparison with pure 2D data, where every point of an object in question requires two numerical statements for its position, 2\u00bdD has the third coordinate (i.e. the height) stored only as an attribute, that is to say not in a spatial structure. Typical examples of 2\u00bdD structures are, for example, right-angled coordinates plus a metric scalar (e.g. height) as an attribute for the point, or geographical latitude\/longitude plus an arbitrary attribute (e.g. slope of terrain, gravitational force, vegetation, height, etc.). While 2D involves point data on a (flat or curved) surface, it is possible to use 2\u00bdD data to construct a virtual spatial model, with the height, e.g. a digital terrain model. The height information may naturally also be part of a true 3D model, i.e. 3D geodata. In contrast to 2\u00bdD, a true 3D model also allows spatial correlations of all attributes or sectional methods for lines and surfaces in space. Examples of the latter are insolation (as a function of slope gradient and direction) or the intersection of geological layers with the terrain. For example, the first input interface  may be embodied as a reading drive for a CD-ROM that contains the digital 2\u00bdD or 3D geodata.","A second input interface  of the navigation apparatus  can be used to read coordinates (e.g. latitude\/longitude) for the geographical position, for example for the current vehicle position, into the navigation system. For example, the second input interface  may be embodied as a communication interface with a GPS locating device (not shown) for ascertaining the current vehicle position.","A third input interface  of the navigation apparatus  can be used for the input of a desired viewing direction or desired viewing height by the user to stipulate a perspective from which the user wishes to view the geographical position on a display apparatus. Thus, the user can stipulate that he wishes to view the roads and the surroundings from a desired (virtual) height, for example 100 m above the vehicle or the earth's surface. In some exemplary embodiments, the virtual viewing point may be not just above but constantly also behind the vehicle position. The desired viewing height can then be converted into a viewing angle that is understood by a rendering program, for example.","A fourth input interface  of the navigation apparatus  can optionally be used to read in further input data that model a (virtual) light source. In this case, these input data are represented as at least one light source stipulation variable, for example, a vector. The light source stipulation variable can comprise statements about the height, the angle, the intensity and\/or the direction of the light source relative to the geographical position that is to be displayed.","In addition, the navigation apparatus  comprises a processor module  that can electronically process the data that are input via the four input interfaces , , , . On the basis of the perspective, stipulated by means of the perspective stipulation variable, and the geographical position, the processor module  can ascertain a coordinate transformation or projection of the digital 2D or 3D geodata that corresponds to the desired viewing direction. In this case, the digital geodata can be converted into a notionally perspective virtual-3D or 3D view, for example by means of a central projection, by the processor module using image reproduction techniques through scaling, rotation and displacement. This is mapping that maps points in the three-dimensional space onto points in a given plane. To enhance the resultant perspective or plastic effect, it is additionally possible for the processor module  to associate different visual perception values, such as different colors, for different topological height values of the digital 2.5D or 3D geodata with the geodata transformed on the basis of the stipulated perspective. In this case, it is possible to use special predefined color tables, for example, that define a soft or fluent color characteristic between adjacent discrete height values. In this way, processor output data that code a visually differently perceptible (perspective) projection of the geodata that corresponds to the height information are obtained. The output data obtained in this manner are output to a display apparatus  of the navigation apparatus  via an output interface .",{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0069","num":"0074"},"figref":"FIG. 2"},"After the method starts in step S, the digital 2.5D or 3D geodata are first of all read in via the first input interface  of the navigation apparatus  in step S.

In step S, the third input interface  is used to read in at least one perspective stipulation variable that corresponds to a desired viewing direction to the geographical position. In an exemplary embodiment, the perspective stipulation variable is a viewing height that is input by the user. The viewing height indicates the virtual height from which the user wishes to view the surroundings around the geographical position. In other words, the viewing height corresponds to a zoom level of a virtual camera that is in the space\u2014the lower the viewing height, the greater the zoom or magnification level. For example, the zoom level can be input using input means (not shown) of the navigation apparatus . It is conceivable for an implementation to involve the use of a rotary switch or the use of control panels on a touchscreen that the user can use to set the zoom level. Direct input of numerical values, for example using a keypad and\/or a touchscreen, are likewise possible. In step S, on the basis of the perspective stipulation variable and the geographical position, a coordinate transformation or projection of the 2D or 3D geodata that corresponds to the desired viewing direction is ascertained. In step S, different visual perception values (e.g. colors, textures, shading, etc.) are associated with different topographical height values in the geodata to obtain a visually differently perceptible transformation or projection of the geodata that corresponds to the height information.

Both a day representation and a night representation or mode are possible.",{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0112","num":"0117"},"figref":"FIG. 14"},"The features disclosed in the description above, the claims below and the enclosed figures may be of significance for realizing an exemplary embodiment in their various refinements, and can be implemented, either individually or in any combination.","Although some aspects have been described in connection with an apparatus, it goes without saying that these aspects are also a description of the corresponding method, which means that a block or an element of an apparatus can also be understood to be a corresponding method step or to be a feature of a method step. Similarly, aspects that have been described in connection with or as a method step are also a description of a corresponding block or detail or feature of a corresponding apparatus.","According to particular implementation requirements, exemplary embodiments may be implemented in hardware or in software. The implementation can be performed using a digital storage medium, for example a floppy disk, a DVD, a BluRay disk, a CD, a ROM, a PROM, an EPROM, an EEPROM or a FLASH memory, a hard disk or another magnetic or optical memory that stores electronically readable control signals that are able to interact or do interact with a programmable hardware component such that the respective method is performed.","A programmable hardware component may be formed by a processor, a computer processor (CPU=Central Processing Unit), a graphics processor (GPU=Graphics Processing Unit), a computer, a computer system, an application-specific integrated circuit (ASIC) an integrated circuit (IC), a system on chip (SOC), a programmable logic element or a field-programmable gate array (FPGA) with a microprocessor.","The digital storage medium may therefore be machine-readable or computer-readable. Some exemplary embodiments thus comprise a data storage medium that has electronically readable control signals that are capable of interacting with a programmable computer system or a programmable hardware component such that one of the methods described herein is performed. An exemplary embodiment is therefore a data storage medium (or a digital storage medium or computer-readable medium) on which the program for performing one of the methods described herein is recorded.","In general, exemplary embodiments may be implemented as a program, firmware, a computer program or computer program product with a program code or as data, the program code or the data being effective for performing one of the methods when the program runs on a processor or programmable hardware component. The program code or the data may also be stored on a machine-readable storage medium or data storage medium, for example. The program code or the data may be present as a source code, machine code or bytecode and as another intermediate code, inter alia.","A program according to one exemplary embodiment can implement one of the methods whilst being performed, for example by reading memory locations or writing a datum or a plurality of data thereto, which possibly prompts switching processes or other processes in transistor structures, in amplifier structures or in other electrical, optical or magnetic components or components operating on another functional principle. Accordingly, data, values, sensor values or other information can be captured, determined or measured by a program by reading a memory location. A program can therefore capture, determine or measure variables, values, measured variables and other information by reading one or more memory locations, and can prompt, bring about or perform an action and actuate other appliances, machines and components by writing to one or more memory locations.","The exemplary embodiments described above are merely an illustration of the principles. It goes without saying that modifications and variations of the arrangements and details described herein will be apparent for a person that is skilled in the art. The intention is, therefore, for the invention to be limited merely by the scope of protection of the patent claims below rather than by the specific details that have been presented herein on the basis of the description and the explanation of the exemplary embodiments."],"brief-description-of-drawings":[{},{}],"description-of-drawings":{"heading":"BRIEF DESCRIPTION OF THE DRAWINGS","p":["Exemplary embodiments are explained in more detail below with reference to the appended figures.",{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0007","num":"0006"},"figref":"FIG. 1"},{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0008","num":"0007"},"figref":"FIG. 2"},{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0009","num":"0008"},"figref":"FIG. 3"},{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0010","num":"0009"},"figref":"FIG. 3"},{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0011","num":"0010"},"figref":"FIGS. 3-3"},{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0012","num":"0011"},"figref":["FIG. 4","FIG. 3"],"i":"a; "},{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0013","num":"0012"},"figref":["FIG. 4","FIG. 3"],"i":"b; "},{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0014","num":"0013"},"figref":"FIG. 5"},{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0015","num":"0014"},"figref":"FIG. 5"},{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0016","num":"0015"},"figref":"FIGS. 5-5"},{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0017","num":"0016"},"figref":"FIG. 5"},{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0018","num":"0017"},"figref":"FIG. 6"},{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0019","num":"0018"},"figref":"FIGS. 7-7"},{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0020","num":"0019"},"figref":"FIG. 7"},{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0021","num":"0020"},"figref":"FIG. 8"},{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0022","num":"0021"},"figref":"FIG. 9"},{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0023","num":"0022"},"figref":"FIG. 10"},{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0024","num":"0023"},"figref":"FIG. 11"},{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0025","num":"0024"},"figref":"FIGS. 12-12"},{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0026","num":"0025"},"figref":"FIG. 13"},{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0027","num":"0026"},"figref":"FIG. 14"}]},"DETDESC":[{},{}]}
