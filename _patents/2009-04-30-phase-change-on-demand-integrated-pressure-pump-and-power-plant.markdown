title: Phase change on demand integrated pressure pump and power plant
abstract: Activation of a propellant in a constant volume container causes a phase change material to rapidly expand so that the pressure in the container increases. Programmability and sequential actuation are enabled by patterning the phase change material into the integrated device. The pressure generated may be used to activate an energy transducer such as a high pressure turbine, a piezoelectric material, and an elastic strain material. This provides a hybrid actuation system of electrical energy, pneumatic and hydraulic power. The pressure change in a constant volume container is also harnessed to provide a microbattery.

{"@attributes":{"id":"description"},"RELAPP":[{},{}],"heading":["CROSS-REFERENCE TO RELATED DISCLOSURE","STATEMENT OF GOVERNMENT INTEREST","BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION","SUMMARY OF THE INVENTION","DETAILED DESCRIPTION OF THE PREFERRED EMBODIMENT"],"p":["This disclosure is divisional application of pending U.S. patent application Ser. No. 11\/470,854, filed Sep. 7, 2006, which application is a continuation in-part to U.S. nonprovisional patent application Ser. No. 10\/605,497, filed Oct. 2, 2003 by the same inventors and having the same title, which is a nonprovisional to provisional patent application No. 60\/319,591, filed Oct. 2, 2002 by the same inventors and having the same title.","The subject invention was made with government support under a research project supported by the Office of Naval Research Grant No. N00014-98-1-0848. The federal government has certain rights in this invention.","This invention relates to a portable pressure pump and integrated power supply that relies on high pressure generated by gases released during the phase change of a phase change material in a closed, constant volume container.","Published patent application WO 00\/03758 in the name of SpectRx & Altea Technolgoes of Atlanta, Ga., discloses a pyrotechnic-based method for making an opening in skin for drug delivery.","Another patent application, number unknown, in the name of Carole Rossi, a researcher affiliated with LAAS-CNRS of Toulouse, France and the University of California at Berkeley, discloses a pyrotechnic method for drug delivery.","Many mechanical, pneumatic, and hydraulic devices are operated by gaseous or liquid pressure. Moreover, electricity-generating turbines are driven by fluids under pressure as well. Gaseous fluids under pressure occupy less space than gaseous fluids that are not under pressure, but it can be problematic in some applications if gaseous fluid under pressure must be maintained in a container or other pressure vessel for extended periods of time so that the gaseous fluid may be released when it is needed to operate a device or to generate electricity. It would be advantageous if there were a way to generate gaseous fluid under pressure on demand so that holding tanks or other pressure vessels having compressed gas therein could be eliminated.","However, in view of the prior art taken as a whole at the time the present invention was made, it was not obvious to those of ordinary skill how the identified need could be fulfilled.","The long-standing but heretofore unfulfilled need for a means for generating high pressure on demand is now met by a new, useful, and non-obvious invention.","The novel method for providing an energy reservoir of compressed fluid on demand includes the steps of positioning a phase change material in a constant volume container and activating a phase change in the phase change material. The pressure in the container thus increases in accordance with the combined gas law.","A method for harnessing the energy in compressed fluid to do usable work includes the steps of providing an energy reservoir of compressed fluid on demand by activating a phase change in a phase change material positioned in a constant volume container and connecting a pressure-driven load in fluid communication with the energy reservoir of compressed fluid. The pressure-driven load may be a turbine adapted to generate electrical power, a piezo-chamber adapted to generate electrical power, a pump, or the like.","The pressure-driven load is positioned between the energy reservoir of compressed fluid and a high pressure storage tank. More particularly, the energy reservoir of compressed fluid is in fluid communication with an input of the pressure driven load and the high pressure storage tank is in fluid communication with an output of the pressure-driven load.","A pneumatic or hydraulic circuit may also be positioned in fluid communication between the energy reservoir of compressed fluid and said high pressure storage tank. A mechanical, fluidic, or other pressure-driven load may be coupled to an output of said pneumatic or hydraulic circuit.","The invention further includes a novel microbattery that includes a plurality of layers of elements that interact with one another to produce an electrical current. A plurality of propellant members, each of which is formed of a phase-change material, is mounted to one of said layers of elements. The microbattery further includes an initiator means that may take the form of a plurality of conductors, each conductor of said plurality of conductors providing electrical communication between a preselected propellant member of said plurality of propellant members and said initiator means.","Another layer provides a pressure cell that defines a closed volume for housing the plurality of propellant members. A fluidic oscillator is mounted on the pressure cell and a flexible diaphragm is mounted to the fluidic oscillator. The flexible diaphragm is adapted to oscillate as the fluid oscillator alternately directs fluid to opposite sides of the flexible diaphragm.","A magnetic core is mounted to the flexible diaphragm. A cap layer is mounted in surmounting relation to the flexible diaphragm. A coil is mounted to the cap layer and is adapted to receive the magnetic core.","A preselected propellant is activated by the initiator means, resulting in an explosion of the preselected propellant that increases pressure within the pressure cell. The pressure is harnessed to drive the fluidic oscillator and the fluidic oscillator causes flow of a preselected fluid to alternately flow to opposite sides of said flexible diaphragm so that the flexible diaphragm oscillates and thereby causes back-and-forth motion of the magnetic core relative to the coil. The relative motion between the magnetic core and the coil produces alternating current.","It is therefore understood that a primary object of the invention is to provide a portable pressure pump and an integrated power supply that relies on high pressure that is generated on demand to obviate any need for storing high pressure gases or liquids.","A more specific object is to generate usable high pressure on demand by activating a phase change material that is housed within a closed container so that the pressure within said container is increased.","Another object is to disclose a microbattery construction made possible by the use of a phase change material for producing high pressure gases on demand.","These and other objects will become apparent as this disclosure proceeds. The invention includes the features of construction, arrangement of parts, and combination of elements set forth herein, and the scope of the invention is set forth in the claims appended hereto.","An integrated pump includes a pressure source and an integrated particulate filter. It pumps clean gas or liquid into separation systems such as chromatographic columns The material used for actuation is any material that transitions through a phase change in a confined, constant volume, resulting in a pressure increase in accordance with the combine gas law. More particularly, the material may be any reactive material such as pyrotechnic powders, plastic based explosives, binary reactant explosives\/propellants, hypergolic reactant propellants, catalytic reactants, combustion reactants or other phase change material.","The phase change material may be patterned into the integrated device. Thus it is understood that the pump may be programmable for sequential actuation.","The novel pump also yields an alternative power supply technology. The pressure generated is used to activate an energy converter such as a high pressure turbine, a piezoelectric material, or an elastic strain material (such as a spring, for example) to convert the energy stored in the compressed fluid. A hybrid actuation system of electrical energy, pneumatic and hydraulic power is thereby created.","A pressure driven fluid pump and pressure driven power supply (either electrical, pneumatic or hydraulic) is reliant upon the pressure developed during a phase change of state of a preselected phase change material.","The phase change is an explosion within a constrained vessel creating a desired high pressure that provides the motive force for fluid transfer, actuation and stored energy for subsequent energy conversion. Significantly, the high pressure is not generated until it is needed, thereby eliminating the prior art need to have gases or liquids maintained in pressure vessels over long periods of time until such pressure is needed.",{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0037","num":"0036"},"figref":"FIG. 1","b":["10","12","14","12","16","18","20","23","20","24","26"]},"The material may be patterned (e.g. using photoreaction polymer-based explosives\/propellants (such as PBX) to enable programmable pressure delivery or a train of actuators for sequential actuation either to maintain a desired pressure over time or actuate over time as part of a process activity.","The filter is integral to the operation of the pump because clean, particulate-free fluid is required in intended applications such as high pressure chromatographic systems.","Methods for actuating the phase change material include thermal, electrical, mechanical impact or an electromechanical hybrid such as piezoelectric. The pressure generated may also be used as an energy reservoir of compressed gas or liquid which is subsequently expanded into a turbine, a piezo-chamber, or other means for converting compressed fluid into electrical power. The compressed liquid or gaseous fluid energy storage may also have utility in delivering pneumatic, mechanical, or hydraulic power for process actuation.","The basic principle behind all embodiments of the invention is explained in connection with . Fixed or constant volume container  houses a liquid\/gas combination. The gas is denoted , the liquid is denoted , and the liquid\/gas interface is denoted . A propellant  is secured to an interior surface of container  in the gas region thereof and a fluid discharge conduit  is in fluid communication with the interior of container  in the liquid region thereof. When propellant  is activated, an explosion results in gaseous fluid that rapidly expands inside container  and drives liquid  into conduit  through turbine  and conduit and compresses gas inside reservoir . A load, not depicted in , is connected to the distal end of fluid discharge conduit  so that the fluid does useful work.","A first embodiment of the invention, depicted in , includes a combined electrical, pneumatic, and hydraulic power plant. In this first embodiment, pressure provided by the explosive phase change is harnessed for electrical power. High pressure storage tank or reservoir  includes inlet  in fluid communication with phase change energy source . High pressure storage tank  is filled with a combination of gas  and liquid  that are separated from one another at liquid\/gas interface . Gas  is in direct fluid communication with phase change energy source . Liquid  is in direct fluid communication with fluid discharge conduit  of high pressure storage tank . Conduit  is in fluid communication with turbine  and said turbine is connected in driving relation to generator . Transformer  connects the output of generator  to electrical loads in a well-known way.","Turbine  is also in fluid communication with reservoir . Reservoir  is a low-pressure reservoir because the pressure therein is less than the pressure in reservoir . The gas is denoted , the liquid is denoted and the liquid\/gas interface is denoted . When propellant  is activated and the liquid is moved from container  into reservoir  through conduit , the gas is compressed and is later expanded to move the liquid back to the initial position, which prepares the system for the next operational cycle. This pressure differential between the high and low pressure reservoirs may be harnessed on demand by any pressure-driven load.","A pneumatic or hydraulic circuit  is in fluid communication with fluid discharge conduit  so that loads other than turbine  may also be driven. Pneumatic or hydraulic circuit  is therefore positioned upstream of turbine  in valved fluid communication with fluid discharge conduit . The valve is denoted .","The combined electrical, pneumatic, and hydraulic power plant of  may be either single use (disposable) or rechargeable.","Pneumatic or hydraulic circuit  is depicted in greater detail in . In , valve  is closed. This has the effect of removing pneumatic or hydraulic circuit  from the apparatus of , i.e., all of the liquid or gaseous fluid flowing in fluid discharge conduit  is delivered to turbine  and no amount of said fluid is diverted into pneumatic or hydraulic circuit .","As depicted in . pneumatic or hydraulic circuit  includes a closed, fixed volume container having diaphragm  that separates chamber  from chamber . Chambers  and  may contain either liquid fluid or gaseous fluid, depending upon the application. Chamber  is in valved communication with fluid discharge conduit . When chamber  is filled with liquid, circuit  is a hydraulic circuit and when chamber  is filled with gas, circuit  is a pneumatic circuit. When valve  is closed, diaphragm  remains in its  position of repose and no liquid or gas flows into fluid discharge conduit . Therefore, no mechanical or fluidic load in communication with said discharge conduit can do work.","When valve  is open, as depicted in , liquid or gaseous fluid flowing in fluid discharge conduit  is diverted into pneumatic or hydraulic circuit . More particularly, said fluid flows into chamber , thereby displacing diaphragm  so that chamber  expands in volume and liquid or gas chamber  contracts in volume so that said liquid or gas is discharged therefrom. A hydraulic load is driven if chamber  is filled with hydraulic fluid and a pneumatic load is driven if chamber  is gas-filled.","A second embodiment is depicted in . The parts of this embodiment are the same as in the embodiment of  with the exception that pump  replaces generator  and there is no transformer . The combined mechanical, pneumatic, and hydraulic power plant of  may be either single use (disposable) or rechargeable.","A third embodiment is depicted in . The parts of this embodiment are the same as the first with the exception that piezo-electric generator  replaces turbine  and generator .","A fourth embodiment is depicted in . The parts of this embodiment are the same as the first with the exception that electromagnetic generator  replaces turbine  and generator . The combined electrical, pneumatic, and hydraulic power plant of  may be either single use (disposable) or rechargeable.",{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0052","num":"0051"},"figref":"FIG. 7","b":["60","62","64","66","68","62","62","68","70","72","60","74","64","76","78","80"]},"In all embodiments, the device may be large in scale.
