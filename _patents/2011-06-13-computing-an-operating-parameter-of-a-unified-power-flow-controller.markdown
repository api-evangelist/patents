No. 12\/633,045, filed on Dec. 8, 2009 now U.S. Pat. No. 8,527,247, is a continuation-in-part of U.S. patent application Ser.

No. 8,121,708, which claims the benefit of U.S. Provisional Patent Application No. 60\/896,043, filed on Mar. 21, 2007. The entireties of each of these applications are incorporated herein by reference.","This invention was developed under contract DE-AC04-94AL85000 between Sandia Corporation and the U.S. Department of Energy. The U.S. Government has certain rights in this invention.","A challenging problem that is facing the United States (and other countries) is the integration of power sources that produce varying amounts of power into the existing (and aging) Electric Power Grid (EPG) infrastructures. Examples of power sources that produce varying amounts of power include wind turbines, solar power systems, hydropower systems, geothermal power systems, and other suitable power sources. For instance, power generated by a wind turbine is directly related to rotational speed of the wind turbine, which is based upon wind speeds. As wind speeds vary over time, the rotational speed of the wind turbine will also vary, and thus the power generated by the wind turbine will likewise vary over time. Similarly, solar power systems generate power as a function of an amount of solar radiation received at a collection of solar panels. As the Sun moves across the sky, the solar radiation received at the collection of solar panels will change, and therefore power output by the solar panels will alter. Moreover, a cloud moving in front of the Sun can cause an amount of power generated by a solar power system to decrease. Similarly, hydropower systems can be affected by position of the moon, an amount of water passing through turbines, etc.","The EPG infrastructures include transformers that are configured to step up and\/or step down voltages during transmission of electrical power over transmission lines. Various power electronics are also configured to monitor faults in the electronic grid and isolate problems so that a remainder of the electronic grid is not negatively affected by an isolated fault. Generally, the EPG infrastructures are designed to transform and transmit power at certain voltage levels and frequency, and power provided that differs from the voltage levels and frequency can damage power electronics in the EPG. Accordingly, systems that cause power generated from variable power sources to conform to specifications of the EPG must be implemented to facilitate integration of variable power sources with the EPG.","An exemplary system that has been utilized in connection with causing power generated by variable power sources to conform to EPG specifications is a Unified Power Flow Controller (UPFC). A UPFC may include a plurality of different types of power electronics devices. In general, the UPFC includes sensors, actuators, and power storage devices (such as batteries, capacitors, or the like). If magnitude of power provided from a variable power source is too low, the UPFC pulls power from storage to cause the power to be at a desired level. Alternatively, if magnitude of power provided from the variable power source is higher than desired, the UPFC causes excess power to be retained in the power storage devices. The end result is that power generated by a variable power source can be provided to an EPG.","Currently, when designing a UPFC, available power electronics hardware is assembled, and the UPFC is designed to control power flow from a variable power source to the EPG using the assembled hardware. This leads to less than optimal utilization of power generated by variable power generation systems.","The following is a brief summary of subject matter that is described in greater detail herein. This summary is not intended to be limiting as to the scope of the claims.","In an exemplary embodiment, described herein is a method that comprises the act of receiving power constraints for an existing power grid that desirably receives power generated from a variable power generation system in accordance with the power constraints. The method further comprises the act of computing at least one operating parameter of a Unified Power Flow Controller that facilitates optimal provision of electric power generated by the variable power generation system to the existing power grid in accordance with the power constraints for the existing power grid.","In another exemplary embodiment, described herein is a Unified Power Flow Controller that includes a sensor that outputs at least one sensed condition. The Unified Power Flow Controller further includes a processor that receives the at least one sensed condition and a memory that comprises control logic that is executable by the processor. Moreover, the Unified Power Flow Controller includes power electronics that comprise power storage, wherein the processor causes the power electronics to selectively cause the power storage to act as one of a power generator or a load based at least in part upon the at least one sensed condition output by the sensor and the control logic, and wherein at least one operating parameter of the power electronics is designed to facilitate maximal transmittal of electrical power generated at a variable power generation system to a grid system while meeting power constraints set forth by the electrical power grid.","Other aspects will be appreciated upon reading and understanding the attached figures and description.","Various technologies pertaining to designing a Unified Power Flow Controller (UPFC) as well as designing control algorithms for the UPFC when the UPFC is configured to interface a variable power generating source with a conventional, existing electric power grid (EPG) will now be described with reference to the drawings, where like reference numerals represent like elements throughout. In addition, several functional block diagrams of exemplary systems are illustrated and described herein for purposes of explanation; however, it is to be understood that functionality that is described as being carried out by certain system components may be performed by multiple components. Similarly, for instance, a component may be configured to perform functionality that is described as being carried out by multiple components. Additionally, as used herein, the term \u201cexemplary\u201d is intended to mean serving as an illustration or example of something, and is not intended to indicate a preference.","As used herein, the terms \u201ccomponent\u201d and \u201csystem\u201d are intended to encompass computer-readable data storage that is configured with computer-executable instructions that cause certain functionality to be performed when executed by a processor. The computer-executable instructions may include a routine, a function, or the like. It is also to be understood that a component or system may be localized on a single device or distributed across several devices. In another exemplary embodiment, a \u201ccomponent\u201d or \u201csystem\u201d can be hardware that is configured to perform particular functionality, such as a field programmable gate array (FPGA).","With reference now to , an exemplary system  that facilitates integrating variable power sources with an existing electric power grid (EPG). The system  comprises a variable power generation system , which can be any suitable power generation system that generates variable amount of power, including but not limited to wind turbine farms, solar farms (which include numerous panels of photovoltaic cells), hydropower systems, geothermal power generation systems, or other suitable power generation systems. The system  further comprises an EPG , wherein the EPG  is desirably provided with electrical power output by the variable power generation system . The EPG  is configured to perform a variety of tasks relating to electricity generation, transmission, distribution, and control. To integrate the variable power generation system  with the EPG , however, the power generated from the variable power generation system  desirably conforms with some predefined specifications of the EPG , such as voltage magnitude, phase, and frequency.","The system  further comprises a Unified Power Flow Controller (UPFC)  that is configured to receive power output from the variable power generation system , and thereafter perform one or more actions to provide electrical power to the EPG  in a form that meets the specifications of the EPG . The UPFC , as will be understood by one skilled in the art, is an electric system that provides fast-acting reactive power compensation on electricity transmission lines. Accordingly, while not shown, the variable power generation system  can be operably coupled to the EPG  by way of a high voltage transmission line, and the UPFC  can be positioned on such line to cause power to be provided to the EPG  in accordance with the specifications of the EPG .","The UPFC  includes a processor  and a memory  that comprises instructions that are executed by the processor . The instructions can be in the form of control logic . The UPFC  further comprises at least one sensor  that senses at least one condition pertaining to electrical power generated by the variable power source . This condition may be voltage magnitude, frequency, current magnitude, frequency, heat of a transmission line, or any other suitable condition that may be indicative of power flow received at the UPFC . The UPFC  further comprises power electronics  that can act as both a generator and a load (energy storage) in the UPFC . In other words, the power electronics  can act to retain energy as well as dissipate energy. The power electronics  may be or comprise a Flexible AC Transmission System (FACTS). In another example, the power electronics  may be or include a battery, a capacitor, a flywheel, or other suitable device that can act to retain and dissipate energy.","The control logic , when executed by the processor , acts to control the power electronics  (and other mechanical and\/or electromechanical components of the UPFC ) based at least in part upon data received from the sensor . In an example, the control logic  can be or include non-linear control logic. Specifically, the sensor  senses at least one condition pertaining to the power received from the variable power generation system , and the processor  transmits commands to the power electronics  that cause the power electronics  to retain or dissipate energy based at least in part upon the at least one condition sensed by the sensor. The power electronics  can further be caused by the processor  to perform functions pertaining to modifying frequency of power and other acts. The output of the UPFC  is AC power that accords to the specifications of the power grid .","The power electronics , as will be described in greater detail below, are designed with specifications that act to substantially optimize an amount of electrical power that is provided to the EPG  by way of the UPFC . For instance, the specifications for the UPFC  can include an amount of capacity for retaining energy, a rate that energy can be retained, a rate that energy can be dissipated, how quickly the power electronics  can be altered from acting as a generator to acting as a load and vice versa, amongst other specifications. Thus, as will be described below, the UPFC  can be designed with specifications that are particularly configured to the variable power generation system  and the constraints set forth by the EPG , which is in contrast to the conventional approach of utilizing whatever power electronics are available, thereby sacrificing system efficiency. Additionally, the control logic  can be designed by taking into consideration the determined specifications.","Now referring to , an exemplary system  that facilitates computing the UPFC specifications discussed above as well as parameters for the control logic is illustrated. The system  comprises a data store , which may be memory of a computing apparatus, a hard drive, or other suitable electronic data storage. The variable power generation system  may, from time to time, have a transient fault associated therewith. Swing equations have been developed to model the behavior of variable power generation systems under transient conditions. Accordingly, for instance, swing equations have been developed that model the behavior of wind turbines when operating under transient conditions. The data store  comprises a Hamiltonian system , wherein the swing equations for the variable power generation system  are formulated as the Hamiltonian system . The Hamiltonian system  can be configured with externally applied non-conservative forces. The data store  further comprises EPG constraints , which describe constraints of the EPG  (including but not limited to voltage magnitude and frequency that is acceptable to the EPG ).","A two-step process can be undertaken in connection with determining desired performance of the UPFC  to enable substantially maximum power output of the variable power generation system  while meeting the constraints of the EPG  on voltage magnitude, frequency, and phase. The system  comprises a conservative analyzer component  that is configured to perform the first step of the two-step process. The conservative analyzer component  can analyze the Hamiltonian system  as a conservative, natural Hamiltonian system with no externally applied non-conservative forces. The Hamiltonian surface of the swing equations is related to the Equal-Area Criterion and the Potential Energy Boundary Surface (PEBs) method to formulate the nonlinear transient stability problem by recognizing that the path of the Hamiltonian system  is constrained to the Hamiltonian surface. This formulation demonstrates the effectiveness of proportional feedback control to expand the stability region. Further, conservative analyzer component  can consider the non-conservative power flows to determine the path of the Hamiltonian system  across the Hamiltonian surface, which can be used to determine stability regions and transient performance.","The system  further comprises a non-conservative analyzer component  that analyzes the Hamiltonian system  as a natural Hamiltonian system with externally applied non-conservative forces. The non-conservative analyzer component  can compute the time derivative of the Hamiltonian system  to produce the work\/rate (power flow) equations which can be used to ensure balanced power flows from the variable power generation system  to the EPG . The non-conservative analyzer component  can further employ the Second Law of Thermodynamics to partition the power flow into three types: 1) the energy storage rate of change; 2) power generation; and 3) power dissipation. The Melnikov number for this class of Hamiltonian systems is directly related to the balance of power flows for the stability (limit cycles) of natural Hamiltonian systems with externally applied non-conservative forces. The non-conservative analyzer component  can further apply the Second Law of Thermodynamics to the power flow equations to determine the stability boundaries (limit cycles) of the variable power generation system , and thereby enable design of the control logic  such that the control logic  acts as a feedback controller that meets the stability requirements while substantially maximizing the power generation and flow to the EPG . In summary, the conservative analyzer component  and the non-conservative analyzer component  can act in conjunction to ascertain specifications for the UPFC  and the control logic  (as a feedback controller) based upon concepts of Hamiltonian systems, power flow, exergy rate (the maximum work that can be extracted from an energy flow), and entropy rate.","Additional detail pertaining to operations of the conservative analyzer component  and the non-conservative analyzer component  are now provided. For the purposes of explanation, the variable power generation system  is assumed to be a wind turbine in the discussion below; it is to be understood, however, that the variable power generation system  can be any suitable variable power generation system.","Swing equations for a wind turbine are as follows:\n\n,\u2003\u2003(1)\n\nwhere Tis the mechanical turbine torque (N\u2212m), Tis the electromagnetic counter torque (N\u2212m), J is the mass polar moment of inertia, \u03c9is the rotor shaft velocity in mechanical rotations\/second, and B is a damping force coefficient.
