The apparatus further comprises means for determining to store the commenting information, the one or more media items, one or more portions of the one or more media items depicting the one or more objects, or a combination thereof for responding to one or more requests for information regarding the one or more objects.","In addition, for various example embodiments of the invention, the following is applicable: a method comprising facilitating a processing of and\/or processing (1) data and\/or (2) information and\/or (3) at least one signal, the (1) data and\/or (2) information and\/or (3) at least one signal based, at least in part, on (including derived at least in part from) any one or any combination of methods (or processes) disclosed in this application as relevant to any embodiment of the invention.","For various example embodiments of the invention, the following is also applicable: a method comprising facilitating access to at least one interface configured to allow access to at least one service, the at least one service configured to perform any one or any combination of network or service provider methods (or processes) disclosed in this application.","For various example embodiments of the invention, the following is also applicable: a method comprising facilitating creating and\/or facilitating modifying (1) at least one device user interface element and\/or (2) at least one device user interface functionality, the (1) at least one device user interface element and\/or (2) at least one device user interface functionality based, at least in part, on data and\/or information resulting from one or any combination of methods or processes disclosed in this application as relevant to any embodiment of the invention, and\/or at least one signal resulting from one or any combination of methods (or processes) disclosed in this application as relevant to any embodiment of the invention.","For various example embodiments of the invention, the following is also applicable: a method comprising creating and\/or modifying (1) at least one device user interface element and\/or (2) at least one device user interface functionality, the (1) at least one device user interface element and\/or (2) at least one device user interface functionality based at least in part on data and\/or information resulting from one or any combination of methods (or processes) disclosed in this application as relevant to any embodiment of the invention, and\/or at least one signal resulting from one or any combination of methods (or processes) disclosed in this application as relevant to any embodiment of the invention.","In various example embodiments, the methods (or processes) can be accomplished on the service provider side or on the mobile device side or in any shared way between service provider and mobile device with actions being performed on both sides.","For various example embodiments, the following is applicable: An apparatus comprising means for performing the method of any of originally filed claims 1-10, 21-30, and 46-48.","Still other aspects, features, and advantages of the invention are readily apparent from the following detailed description, simply by illustrating a number of particular embodiments and implementations, including the best mode contemplated for carrying out the invention. The invention is also capable of other and different embodiments, and its several details can be modified in various obvious respects, all without departing from the spirit and scope of the invention. Accordingly, the drawings and description are to be regarded as illustrative in nature, and not as restrictive.","Examples of a method, apparatus, and computer program for associating one or more commenting information with on one or more content items detected in one or more media items. In the following description, for the purposes of explanation, numerous specific details are set forth in order to provide a thorough understanding of the embodiments of the invention. It is apparent, however, to one skilled in the art that the embodiments of the invention may be practiced without these specific details or with an equivalent arrangement. In other instances, well-known structures and devices are shown in block diagram form in order to avoid unnecessarily obscuring the embodiments of the invention.",{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0026","num":"0025"},"figref":"FIG. 1"},"A benefit of using such applications allows for the association of user defined information (e.g., rankings, comments, observations, etc.) with a content item and\/or point of interest (POI) (e.g., a business, a building, an object, a location, etc.) This user defined information may be shared with others or kept for a user to remind the user of the content item\/POI. Typically, the more accurately the user information (e.g., ranking, comment, etc.) is associated with a content item, the more useful the information will be when sharing and\/or re-using the information. As such, the user defined information associated with a content item may be utilized when presenting and\/or sorting search results, which may increase the potential of a better match to what the user is searching for and\/or would be inclined to utilize and\/or share with one or more other users. Alternatively, the user defined information can provide to the user and\/or to other users a quick indication of previous preferences, rankings and\/or comments associated with the one or more content items. As such, technical challenges arise in determining and associating the one or more content items with the user defined commenting information.","To address these problems, a system  of  introduces the capability to associate one or more commenting information with one or more content items detected in one or more media items. As shown in , a user may utilize a user equipment (UE)  to capture and\/or retrieve a media item including an image of a target (e.g., a point of interest (POI), an object, a building, etc.). Further, the media item and\/or related information (e.g., contextual, location, type, etc.) may be presented to services platform , content provider -(also collectively known as content provider ) and\/or content mapping platform  via a communication network . The content and mapping information can be used by applications  on the UE  (e.g., a mapping application, a navigation application, etc.) to render a view of the target on a mapping application. In the example of , the content mapping platform  stores mapping information in the map database and content information in the content catalog . By way of example, the mapping information includes digital maps, GPS coordinates, prerecorded views, geo-tagged data, POI data, or a combination thereof. Further, the content information includes one or more identifiers, metadata, access addresses (e.g., network address such as a Uniform Resource Locator (URL) or an Internet Protocol (IP) address; or a local address such as a file or storage location in a memory of the UE , description, or the like associated with the content. In one embodiment, content includes live media (e.g., streaming broadcasts), stored media (e.g., stored on a network or locally), metadata associated with media, text information or a combination thereof. The content may be provided by the services platform  which includes one or more services -(e.g., music service, mapping service, video service, social networking service, content broadcasting service, etc.), the content provider  (e.g., online content retailers, public databases, etc.) and\/or other content sources available or accessible over the communication network .","Additionally or alternatively, in certain embodiments, a user map and content data  of the UE  may be utilized in conjunction with the applications  to present content information, location information (e.g., mapping and navigation information), ranking information, user comments, etc. to the user. The user may be presented with a user interface associated with the applications  and\/or the content mapping platform allowing 3D objects or other representations of the content and related information to be superimposed onto an image of a physical environment on the UE .","By way of example, the UE  may execute the applications  to receive content and\/or mapping information from the content mapping platform  or other components of the communication network . As mentioned above, the UE  may utilize GPS satellites  and\/or assisted GPS (A-GPS) to determine the location of the UE  to utilize the content mapping functions of the content mapping platform  and\/or the applications , and the map information stored in the map database may be created from live camera views of real-world targets (e.g., buildings, POIs, etc.) and\/or other sites. As such, the content can be augmented into prerecorded views and\/or live camera views of real world locations (e.g., based on location coordinates such as GPS and\/or A-GPS coordinates). Map information may include maps, satellite images, street and path information, point of interest (POI) information, signing information associated with maps, objects and structures associated with the maps, information about people and the locations of people, coordinate information associated with the information, etc., or a combination thereof. A POI can be a specific point location that a person may, for instance, find interesting or useful. Examples of POIs can include an airport, a bakery, a dam, a landmark, a restaurant, a hotel, a building, a park, the location of a person, or any point interesting, useful, or significant in some way.","In one embodiment, one or more media items are captured and\/or retrieved and one or more objects are detected in the one or more media items. For example, a user may utilize the UE  to capture a media item (e.g., an image) of a POI\/object wherein the applications  and\/or a service provider (e.g., services platform  and\/or at the content provider ) can detect one or more objects (e.g., a building, a car, a caf\u00e9, a bar, etc.) in the media item. In another embodiment, the applications  and\/or the service provider can present a user interface on the UE  whereby the user is able to enter and associate one or more commenting information with the one or more objects in the media item. In another embodiment, the applications , the user and\/or the service provider determine how and where to store the commenting information, the one or more media items, one or more portions of the one or more media items depicting the one or more objects, or a combination thereof for responding to one or more requests for information regarding the one or more objects. In one embodiment, one or more requests are made via one or more services and\/or one or more applications. For example, a user may utilize a search application and submit the search request to services platform . In another example, a media item and its associated one or more commenting information may be stored at a local storage user map & content data  for future use. In another embodiment, the media item and the associated one or more commenting information are stored at a remote storage device such as the content catalog and\/or at the services platform  and\/or at the content provider . In various embodiments, the user may further associate one or more sharing, security and\/or privacy policies with one or more portions of the media item and\/or the commenting information.","In various embodiments, the one or more requests may be presented by the user (e.g., a user who has provided commenting information), one or more other users (e.g., friends of the user) or a combination thereof wherein the services platform  and\/or the content provider  can present (e.g., send, provide, transmit) the commenting information, the one or more media items, the one or more portions of the one or more media items, or a combination thereof. In one embodiment, the services platform  and\/or at the content provider  may process one or more information (e.g., social networking information, one or more social graphs, etc.) associated with the one or more other users in order to determine one or more information related to the one or more other users are (e.g., identity, login name, account information, location, etc.)","In another embodiment, the commenting information, the one or more media items, the one or more portions of the one or more media items, or a combination thereof are aggregated with other information related to the one or more objects, wherein the other information is obtained from one or more service providers. For example, the commenting information may include ranking and comments, by the user, which are associated with one or more objects can be aggregated with other information (e.g., available publicly and\/or from other users) related to the one or more objects. Further, one or more portions of the aggregated information and\/or media items can be shared with one or more other users, groups, service provider and the like.","In one embodiment, the applications , the services platform  and\/or the content provider  can utilize the commenting information to determine the other information (e.g., available publicly or from other users), or a sort order for presenting the other information, or a combination thereof. For example, a commenting information may include information provided by a user which may have been aggregated with other information retrieved form a service provider and\/or another user wherein the aggregated information can be processed (e.g., by the applications  and\/or a service provider) to ascertain source of the one or more information and to further sort and present the aggregated information in an order determined by a user, by a service provider, by an application and the like. For example, a user may wish to receive and\/or view results of a search for a POI based, at least in part, on the ranking provided by a friend.","In one embodiment, the user, the services platform  and\/or the content provider  can determine and\/or associate one or more privacy policies and\/or one or more security policies with the commenting information, the one or more media items, the one or more portions of the one or more media items, the at least one user, the one or more other users and the like. In another embodiment, the presentation of the commenting information, the one or more media items and\/or the one or more portions of the one or more media items is based, at least in part, on the one or more privacy policies and\/or the one or more security policies. For example, a user may identify (e.g., tag, mark, amend) one or more objects and\/or one or more commenting information (e.g., that he created) as private (e.g., not to be share with others). In another example, a user may identify another user who may access the one or more commenting information, the one or more media items, the one or more portions of the one or more media items. In another example, a service provider may provide access rights to one or more users based, at least in part, on membership, paid fees, group association and the like.","In one embodiment, the applications  can detect a capture and\/or an access of the one or more media items and can further present a user interface for inputting the commenting information. For example, a user takes a picture of a building of a caf\u00e9 and identifies the caf\u00e9 (e.g., marks, highlights, selects, etc.) as a point of interest (POI) and\/or an object for a possible search for content\/information. Further, the applications  presents a user interface (e.g., a graphical user interface, GUI) including options\/methods for the user to associate one or more commenting information (e.g., comments, ranking, location information, etc.) with the POI\/object in the picture. In various embodiments, the commenting information includes, at least in part, a ranking, one or more comments, a numerical grade, a textual grade, or a combination thereof. For example, the commenting information may include comment text providing description about the POI\/object (e.g., good food at the caf\u00e9, good service, good prices, etc.) In various embodiments, the commenting information may include a numerical grade\/ranking (e.g., 1 out of 4, 1 star out of 5 stars, etc.), textual grade (e.g., \u201cA\u201d, \u201cC\u201d, \u201cF\u201d, etc.) and the like.","In one embodiment, the one or more requests are made via one or more services, one or more applications, or a combination thereof.","By way of example, the communication network  of the system  includes one or more networks such as a data network (not shown), a wireless network (not shown), a telephony network (not shown), or any combination thereof. It is contemplated that the data network may be any local area network (LAN), metropolitan area network (MAN), wide area network (WAN), a public data network (e.g., the Internet), or any other suitable packet-switched network, such as a commercially owned, proprietary packet-switched network, e.g., a proprietary cable or fiber-optic network. In addition, the wireless network may be, for example, a cellular network and may employ various technologies including enhanced data rates for global evolution (EDGE), general packet radio service (GPRS), global system for mobile communications (GSM), Internet protocol multimedia subsystem (IMS), universal mobile telecommunications system (UMTS), etc., as well as any other suitable wireless medium, e.g., worldwide interoperability for microwave access (WiMAX), Long Term Evolution (LTE) networks, code division multiple access (CDMA), wideband code division multiple access (WCDMA), wireless fidelity (WiFi), satellite, mobile ad-hoc network (MANET), and the like.","The UE  is any type of mobile terminal, fixed terminal, or portable terminal including a mobile handset, station, unit, device, multimedia computer, multimedia tablet, Internet node, communicator, desktop computer, laptop computer, Personal Digital Assistants (PDAs), or any combination thereof. It is also contemplated that the UE  can support any type of interface to the user (such as \u201cwearable\u201d circuitry, etc.)","By way of example, the UE , and content mapping platform  communicate with each other and other components of the communication network  using well known, new or still developing protocols. In this context, a protocol includes a set of rules defining how the network nodes within the communication network  interact with each other based on information sent over the communication links. The protocols are effective at different layers of operation within each node, from generating and receiving physical signals of various types, to selecting a link for transferring those signals, to the format of information indicated by those signals, to identifying which software application executing on a computer system sends or receives the information. The conceptually different layers of protocols for exchanging information over a network are described in the Open Systems Interconnection (OSI) Reference Model.","Communications between the network nodes are typically effected by exchanging discrete packets of data. Each packet typically comprises (1) header information associated with a particular protocol, and (2) payload information that follows the header information and contains information that may be processed independently of that particular protocol. In some protocols, the packet includes (3) trailer information following the payload and indicating the end of the payload information. The header includes information such as the source of the packet, its destination, the length of the payload, and other properties used by the protocol. Often, the data in the payload for the particular protocol includes a header and payload for a different protocol associated with a different, higher layer of the OSI Reference Model. The header for a particular protocol typically indicates a type for the next protocol contained in its payload. The higher layer protocol is said to be encapsulated in the lower layer protocol. The headers included in a packet traversing multiple heterogeneous networks, such as the Internet, typically include a physical (layer 1) header, a data-link (layer 2) header, an internetwork (layer 3) header and a transport (layer 4) header, and various application headers (layer 5, layer 6 and layer 7) as defined by the OSI Reference Model.","In one embodiment, the applications , the services platform  and\/or the content mapping platform  may interact according to a client-server model, so that the applications  of the UE  requests mapping and\/or content data from the services platform  and\/or the content mapping platform  on demand. According to the client-server model, a client process sends a message including a request to a server process, and the server process responds by providing a service (e.g., providing map information). The server process may also return a message with a response to the client process. Often the client process and server process execute on different computer devices, called hosts, and communicate via a network using one or more protocols for network communications. The term \u201cserver\u201d is conventionally used to refer to the process that provides the service, or the host computer on which the process operates. Similarly, the term \u201cclient\u201d is conventionally used to refer to the process that makes the request, or the host computer on which the process operates. As used herein, the terms \u201cclient\u201d and \u201cserver\u201d refer to the processes, rather than the host computers, unless otherwise clear from the context. In addition, the process performed by a server can be broken up to run as multiple processes on multiple hosts (sometimes called tiers) for reasons that include reliability, scalability, and redundancy, among others.",{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0043","num":"0042"},"figref":"FIG. 2","b":["107","101","201","107","201","203","101","203","213","111","213","213"]},"Next, the control logic  interacts with a location module  to retrieve location data of the current location of the UE . In one embodiment, the location data may include addresses, geographic coordinates (e.g., GPS coordinates) or other indicators (e.g., longitude and latitude information) that can be associated with a current location. For example, the location data may be manually entered by the user (e.g., entering an address or title, clicking on a digital map, etc.) or extracted or derived from any geo-tagged data. It is contemplated that the location data or geo-tagged data could also be created by the location module  by deriving the location associated metadata such as media titles, tags, and comments. More specifically, the location module  can parse the metadata for any terms that indicate association with a particular location.","In one embodiment, the location module  determines the user's location by a triangulation system such as a GPS, assisted GPS (A-GPS) A-GPS, Cell of Origin, wireless local area network triangulation, or other location extrapolation technologies. Standard GPS and A-GPS systems can use satellites  to pinpoint the location (e.g., longitude, latitude, and altitude) of the UE . A Cell of Origin system can be used to determine the cellular tower that a cellular UE  is synchronized with. This information provides a coarse location of the UE  because the cellular tower can have a unique cellular identifier (cell-ID) that can be geographically mapped. The location module  may also utilize multiple technologies to detect the location of the UE . GPS coordinates can provide finer detail as to the location of the UE . As previously noted, the location module  may be utilized to determine location coordinates for use by the applications  and\/or the content mapping platform .","The control logic  then interacts with a content management module  and the image module  to augment content information related to one or more targets (e.g., POIs) in one or more media items. The target and\/or content may be received from the services platform , the content provider , other like components, or a combination thereof. It is also contemplated that the user may utilize the UE  to capture a target. In one embodiment, the content management module  may create a content catalog listing all content items and associated access addresses and\/or pointers provided to the content management module . In certain embodiments, the content catalog may include additional descriptive information and other metadata describing the content. The available media content or stream can take many forms (e.g., live video feeds, photographs, audio files, etc.) and can be delivered using any number means (e.g., streaming media, downloaded media, spontaneously created media, etc.). The content management module  includes one or more sub-modules or application programming interfaces (APIs) for receiving and\/or detecting the media content in its native format or for converting the media content to a media format compatible with the applications  (e.g., mapping). In other embodiments, the content management module  may initiate a download or installation of the components (e.g., codecs, player applications, etc.) needed to verify the content or stream. The content data can be cached or saved in the user map and content data . Additionally, to facilitate finding specific content or features, the content management module  enables the user to input search criteria (e.g., a content item, person, city, weather, etc.) and to get guidance for finding the direction where the searched content item is located in the real physical world.","In one embodiment, the communication interface  can be used to communicate with a location services platform  or other UEs . Certain communications can be via methods such as an internet protocol, messaging (e.g., SMS, MMS, etc.), or any other communication method (e.g., via the communication network ). In some examples, the UE  can send a request to the services platform  via the communication interface . The services platform  may then send a response back via the communication interface .","The target and related content can be depicted as a thumbnail overlaid on the user interface map at the location corresponding to a point of interest (e.g., a floor) or a portion of the point of interest (e.g., facilities on the floor), and affixed to the POI at a fixed 3D orientation. As discussed, the user interface may be a graphical user interface. In addition or alternatively, the user interface may be an audio or tactile interface.","In certain embodiments, the user map and content data  includes all or a portion the information in the map database and the content catalog . From the selected viewpoint, a live image view augmented with the content can be provided on the screen of the UE . In certain embodiments, the content management nodule  provides a correlated prerecorded panoramic view from the selected view point with content generated or retrieved from the user map and content data  or the content mapping platform . The content information can be embedded\/tagged in the correlated prerecorded panoramic view previously by another apparatus or by the content management module  on demand and\/or in a real time manner when displays the correlated prerecorded panoramic view on the screen of the UE .","Content and mapping information may be presented to the user via a user interface , which may include various methods of communication. For example, the user interface  can have outputs including a visual component (e.g., a screen), an audio component (e.g., a verbal instructions), a physical component (e.g., vibrations), and other methods of communication. User inputs can include a touch-screen interface, microphone, camera, a scroll-and-click interface, a button interface, etc. Further, the user may input a request to start the applications  (e.g., a mapping and user interface application) and utilize the user interface  to receive content and mapping information. Through the user interface , the user may request different types of content, mapping, or location information to be presented. Further, the user may be presented with 3D or augmented reality representations of particular locations and related objects (e.g., buildings, terrain features, POIs, etc. at the particular location) as part of a graphical user interface on a screen of the UE . As mentioned, the UE  communicates with the content mapping platform  services platform , and\/or content provider  to fetch content, mapping, and or location information. The UE  may utilize requests in a client server format to retrieve the content and mapping information. Moreover, the UE  may specify location information and\/or orientation information in the request to retrieve the content and mapping information.",{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0051","num":"0050"},"figref":["FIG. 3","FIG. 8"],"b":["107","111","300","107","201","300","101","111"]},"In step , the applications  processes and\/or facilitates a processing of one or more media items to cause, at least in part, a detection of one or more objects in the one or more media items. In one embodiment, a user utilizes the UE  to submit one or more media items, for example to the services platform  and\/or to the content provider , for determining one or more objects in the one or more media items. In various embodiments, the user may utilize the UE  to capture the one or more media items, to retrieve the one or more media items from a local; user map and content data ; or a remote storage device content catalog , receive it from another user, and\/or from other sources available to the user wherein the retrieval can include a transmission of a request for the one or more media items and a receipt of the one or more media items. In another embodiment, the UE  utilizes applications  to process, at least in part, the one or more media items in order to determine the one or more objects. In other various embodiments, the services platform  and\/or the content provider  can provide the one or more media items based on a location of the UE  wherein the location can be determined based on the location module  and\/or other components of the UE  or based on input by the user (e.g., entering a zip code and\/or address). Further, the input can include a selection of the content and an option to alter or augment the content. This option can be provided to the user based on a permission associated with the content. For example, if the content requires a certain permission to alter the content, the user may be required to provide authentication information to update the content. The content can be manipulated by changing text associated with the content, a location or point(s) associated with the content, commenting on the content, removing part of the content, replacing the content (e.g., replace a video with an image, another video, etc.), a combination thereof, etc.","Then, at step , the applications  causes, at least in part, an association of commenting information with the one or more objects, wherein the commenting information is associated with at least one user. In one embodiment, a user associates (e.g., uploads, writes, attaches, selects, links, etc.) one or more information items, via the applications , with the one or more objects. For example, a user has an image of a restaurant (e.g., an image of its building, its dining area, etc.) and wishes to write one or more comments related to the user's experience (e.g., quality of service, food, ambiance, establishment, etc.) at the restaurant. Additionally, the user can rank the restaurant (e.g., give a number of stars, a numerical value, a letter grade, etc.), via the applications , based on the user's experience and\/or other information available to the user. In another embodiment, based on the user interface, the user can select a point or multiple points on the user interface (e.g., via a touch enabled input) wherein the input can be via a touch enabled input, a scroll and click input, or any other input mechanism.","In step , the services platform  determines to store the commenting information, the one or more media items, one or more portions of the one or more media items depicting the one or more objects, or a combination thereof for responding to one or more requests for information regarding the one or more objects. In one embodiment, the user, the services platform  and\/or the content provider can determine where to store the user's commenting information.

In another embodiment, the user wishes to store the commenting information at the services platform  for future reference, for sharing with other users and\/or services or a combination thereof. For example, the user may allow sharing of the commenting information with one or more specified users or group of users (e.g., at a social networking group), with one or more service providers (e.g., identified by the user or the services platform ), content providers and the like. In another embodiment, the user causes to store the one or more media items and one or more associated comments at the UE , at the services platform , at the content provider  and the like. For example, the user has an image of a restaurant's building, which may be associated with one or more user comments and\/or one or more user rankings. In another embodiment, the user has a media item which includes an image of a restaurant's building along with other images (e.g., image of a shop next to the restaurant) wherein the user causes to store portion of the media item which has the image of the restaurant's building and one or more associated comments and\/or rankings.","Next, at step , the services platform  determines the one or more requests from the at least one user, one or more other users, or a combination thereof.

For example, a user utilizes UE  to capture an image of a bookstore near his office and associates a comment and a ranking with the image wherein the comments may relate to a selection of books, services, a caf\u00e9 in the bookstore, live reading sessions, and the like. Further, the user may retrieve or already have prior other information, related to the bookstore, from one or more other users and\/or one or more other service providers wherein the user may aggregate the image and the commenting information he has with that of the prior instances. One advantage in doing the aggregation could be a more complete and update to date image, information and\/or ranking.","Then, at step , the applications  and\/or the services platform  process and\/or facilitate a processing of the commenting information to determine at least a portion of the other information, a sort order for presenting the other information, or a combination thereof. In one embodiment, the available commenting information (e.g., by user, by service provider, by other users, aggregated, etc.) is processed in order to determine its possible attributes such as source of the information, date of the information, permissions associated with the information (e.g., private, personal, share with select user, share widely, etc.) and the like. For example, one or more portions of available commenting information related to an image may be for personal use while one or more other portions may be available for sharing\/distribution. In one use scenario, John may wish to share with his brother his comments\/rankings associated with a new restaurant in the area while wishing to keep those comments private and allow his friends experience the new restaurant for themselves and then compare comments\/rankings.","At step , the applications  and\/or the services platform  determine one or more privacy policies, one or more security policies, or a combination thereof associated with the commenting information, the one or more media items, the one or more portions of the one or more media items, the at least one user, the one or more other users, or a combination thereof. In various embodiments, a user and\/or a service provider may associate one or more privacy and\/or security policies with one or more media items, one or more portions of the one or more media items, a user, one or more other users and the like. In one embodiment, a user may register the privacy\/security policies in UE  for future reference when accessing the media and\/or information items. Furthermore, in step , use and\/or sharing of a media item and\/or commenting information may be limited to a certain user or group of users. For example, only members of a certain club may utilize interior images of the club facilities which may be available on a network resource (e.g., a server), but may be marked as restricted for the members' use only. In another embodiment, commenting information\/rankings and\/or images (e.g., by a user, by a service provider) may be available to members of a certain group (e.g., on a social networking site) or to those users who will enroll for certain services (e.g., an informational service, searching service, social networking services, etc.) In another embodiment, a user and\/or a service provider may provide one or more portions of the media item, image commenting information and\/or the rankings.

In another embodiment, a user may access the image at the services platform  without having to download the image to the UE . For example, a user interface via applications  may present on the UE  display a media item whereby the user may indicate (e.g., by pointing, selecting, highlighting, etc.) one or more images in the media items as a target for processing. In another embodiment, a user may receive the media item from another user.","Then, at step , the applications  cause, at least in part, a presentation of a user interface for inputting the commenting information. In one embodiment, a GUI can be presented to the user via a display of the UE  whereby the user can associate\/input (e.g., attach, write, select, highlight, paste, etc.) commenting information related to the one or more media items. For example, the user may write commenting information in a text area associated with the media item as well as selecting a ranking (e.g., three stars) for the media item. Further, the GUI can present to the user a view of the image, commenting information, ranking and the like before the user chooses to store (e.g., locally or remotely) the media item and any associated commenting information wherein the commenting information includes a ranking, one or more comments, a numerical grade, a textual grade, or a combination thereof. For example, a user may associate (e.g., \u201cvery good service\u201d) comments, assign a numerical ranking (e.g., 3 out of 5, 4 stars, in top 5%), a letter grade (e.g., A, B, F). In another embodiment, the commenting information and rankings maybe associated with different aspects of the target (e.g., separated into different categories). For example, during his last trip to New York, John dined at a diner in where he had mixed feelings about his experience; however, not wishing to rank the entire experience in one ranking, he writes his comments about the experience (e.g., \u201cgood food, good prices, poor parking area, not enough room for customers, friendly staff, etc.\u201d), ranks the food \u201cfour stars\u201d, ranks the parking information \u201cone star\u201d, ranks the staff \u201c3 stars\u201d and the like.

After equalizing the bit stream, the modulator  combines the signal with a RF signal generated in the RF interface . The modulator  generates a sine wave by way of frequency or phase modulation. In order to prepare the signal for transmission, an up-converter  combines the sine wave output from the modulator  with another sine wave generated by a synthesizer  to achieve the desired frequency of transmission.
