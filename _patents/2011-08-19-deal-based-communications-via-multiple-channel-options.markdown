{"@attributes":{"id":"description"},"BRFSUM":[{},{}],"heading":["BACKGROUND","DETAILED DESCRIPTION","CONCLUSION"],"p":["Many merchants offer deals to individuals to increase the acquisition of the items by consumers from the merchants. In many cases, information related to deals may be exchanged between the consumers, the merchants, service providers, third-parties, or combinations thereof. For example, individuals may receive information about deals from merchants, service providers, deal sourcers, and the like. Additionally, input options to acquire deals and information about transactions to acquire deals may be exchanged between entities associated with offering deals and the individuals acquiring the deals. Further, transactions may be conducted relating to the redemption of deals, the refunding of the value of deals, and\/or the refunding of the value of items acquired in association with the deals.","Typically, information may be exchanged in association with the advertising, acquisition, redemption, and return\/refund of deals via a limited number of options. To illustrate, an individual may receive information about a deal via a mobile client device, acquire the deal via the mobile client device, and redeem the deal via the mobile client device. In another illustration, an individual may receive information about a deal via a site of a service provider, acquire the deal via the site of the service provider, and redeem the deal via the site of the service provider. Providing limited options to obtain information about deals, acquire deals, redeem deals, obtain refunds\/returns in association with deals, and so forth, may be inconvenient and limit participation in deals by individuals and\/or merchants.","This disclosure describes architectures and techniques to provide an extensible platform including a number of options to exchange information related to deals via a plurality of channels. The information about the deals may be exchanged between a service provider, merchants, individuals, deal sourcers, third parties, or combinations thereof. Each of the communication channels may be utilized to exchange communications about different aspects of acquiring and redeeming deals. For example, the plurality of channels may include an advertising channel that provides information to individuals about deals. In another example, the plurality of channels may include a publishing channel that provides input options that are selectable to initiate transactions to acquire deals. Additionally, the plurality of channels may include an acquisition channel that is utilized to exchange communications directed to transactions to acquire deals. Further, the plurality of channels may include a redemption channel that is utilized to exchange communications directed to the acquisition of items in association with deals including the sending and receiving of redemption information, such as redemption codes. The plurality of channels may also include a return\/refund channel that manages communications associated with the return of items acquired in association with deals and the refund of the price of certain deals.","Communications may be exchanged between the service provider, merchants, individuals, and other entities via a number of options with respect to each channel. In some cases, the channel options may be related to categories of computing devices (e.g. smart phones, laptop computers, electronic reader devices, etc.), operating systems executed by computing devices (e.g. Android\u00ae, iOS\u00ae, Windows\u00ae, etc.), one or more sites (e.g. merchant sites, social networking sites, micro-blogging sites, content sharing sites, etc.), one or more forms of communication (e.g. emails, messages, phone calls, etc.), client device applications, combinations thereof, and so forth.","In some cases, a service provider that offers deals on behalf of merchants may determine one or more options for each communication channel with respect to the merchants. For example, the service provider may determine that information communicated on an advertising channel about deals for a particular merchant will be provided via a site of the particular merchant and via a mobile device application. The service provider may also determine that information communicated on an acquisition channel about deals of the particular merchant will take place via a deals site maintained by the service provider. The channel options determined by the service provider with respect to the particular merchant may be based at least partly on information associated with the merchant, such as performance of previous deals of the particular merchant, ratings of the particular merchant, preferences of the particular merchant, capabilities of computing devices of the particular merchant, and so forth.","In addition, the service provider may determine options with respect to at least one channel for individuals that may participate in deals offered by the service provider. The channel options associated with each particular individual may depend, at least in part, on item and\/or deal acquisition history of the individuals, preferences of the individuals, location of the individuals, previous usage of channel options by the individuals, capabilities of computing devices of the individuals, and the like.","After determining options for at least a portion of the channels for merchants offering deals and individuals that may receive information about the deals, communications with respect to the deals may be exchanged over the channels via certain channel options. In an illustrative implementation, a particular merchant may offer a deal and the service provider may identify a target audience for the deal. The service provider may provide information to the members of the target audience via the advertising channel using one or more channel options. The service provider may have determined that information for the particular deal will be provided to a target audience for the deal based on certain information associated with the merchant, certain information associated with the individuals, or both. Communications may also be exchanged between the service provider and individuals included in the target audience with respect to acquiring the deal via one or more options determined by the service provider for the acquisition channel. When an individual acquires items in association with the deal, the service provider may exchange communications with individuals of the target audience, merchants, or both, via one or more channel options determined by the service provider in association with the redemption channel.","By providing a number of options for information about deals to be exchanged on multiple channels, a service provider may increase the convenience for individuals to acquire and redeem deals. In addition, the service provider may increase the number of individuals receiving information about deals offered by the service provider on behalf of merchants when a number of options are available for information exchange with respect to certain channels. Thus, the number of deals acquired from the service provider may increase, which leads to increased revenue for the merchant, the service provider, other entities involved in offering deals on behalf of merchants, or combinations thereof. Additionally, by providing an extensible platform configured to add one or more channels and\/or channel options, the service provider may increase the number of merchants offering deals via the service provider and also increase the number of individuals acquiring deals and redeeming deals via the service provider.","Example Architecture",{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0021","num":"0020"},"figref":"FIG. 1","b":["100","100","102","104"]},"The items offered in association with the deals described herein may include tangible items, intangible items, products, goods, services, a bundle of items, digital goods, digital services, and the like.

For example, the deal information may indicate a preference to offer the deal  to individuals that have a particular item acquisition history, that have previously acquired deals offered by the merchant , that have certain demographic characteristics, and so on.","The architecture  includes a number of channels - for exchanging communications related to deals. The channels - represent certain information that is conveyed via the respective channels. In some cases, the information communicated via the channels - may be conveyed via one or more user interfaces displayed via client devices of individuals receiving the information. The information itself may be communicated via one or more networks, such as local networks, wide area networks, wired networks, wireless networks, combinations thereof, and so forth.","In a particular implementation, the advertising channel  is directed to communications associated with providing information about deals to individuals to encourage the individuals to acquire the deals. For example, advertising and\/or promotional information indicating terms of deals, information about one or more items offered in association with deals, information about one or more merchants offering deals, combinations thereof, and the like, may be provided to individuals via the advertising channel. Additionally, the publishing channel  may be directed to communications associated with offering deals for acquisition. To illustrate, the publishing channel  may provide information related to acquiring deals, such as terms of the deals, information about items offered in association with deals, information about merchants offering the deals, input options selectable to acquire the deals (e.g. \u201cBuy Now\u201d button, \u201cAdd to Cart\u201d button, etc.), combinations thereof, and the like. In certain cases, the publishing channel  can convey information similar to the information provided via the advertising channel . In addition, information provided via the publishing channel  may be provided in response to selection of an input option or link to receive additional information about deals that is provided via the advertising channel .","Further, the architecture  includes an acquisition channel  that is directed to exchanging communications related to acquiring deals. In certain instances, information may be exchanged via the acquisition channel  in response to selection of an input option to acquire a deal that is provided via the publishing channel . The information exchanged via the acquisition channel  may include an order pipeline where information utilized to conduct a transaction to acquire the deal is provided, such as payment instrument information, account information, and so forth. The acquisition channel  may also be utilized by the service provider  to provide information related to confirmation of the acquisition of deals and redemption information associated with the deals, such as vouchers, redemption codes, etc.","The architecture  may also include a redemption channel  that is directed to exchanging communications related to the acquisition of items in association with deals. In some instances, the information exchanged via the redemption channel  may be between individuals acquiring items in association with deals, the service provider , merchants offering the deals, third parties (e.g. financial institutions, payment instrument entities, payment services entities, etc.), or combinations thereof. The information exchanged via the redemption channel  may include requests to acquire items in association with deals, redemption codes associated with the deals, other information related to transactions to acquire items (e.g. payment instrument information, item delivery information, item pick-up information, etc.), combinations thereof, and the like.","In addition, the architecture  includes a return\/refund channel  that is directed to exchanging communications related to the return of items acquired in association with deals, the return of deals acquired from the service provider , the refund of value for items returned that were acquired in association with deals, the refund of value for deals returned, or combinations thereof. In certain situations, the information exchanged via the return\/refund channel  may be between individuals acquiring items in association with deals, the service provider , merchants offering the deals, third parties (e.g. financial institutions, payment instrument entities, payment services entities, etc.), or combinations thereof. For example, the communications exchanged via the return\/refund channel  may be associated with providing value to an account of individuals returning items and\/or deals, conveying an updated value of a particular deal, and the like.","The architecture  may include one or more channel options, such as channel options -. The channel options - may represent various means to communicate information via the channels -. In certain instances, each of the channels - may be associated with one or more of the channel options -. The channel options - may include categories of computing devices, such as smart phones, mobile handsets, laptop computers, tablet computers, electronic reader devices, desktop computers, combinations thereof, and the like. The channel options - may also include operating systems executed by computing devices, such as Android\u00ae, iOS\u00ae, Windows\u00ae, etc. Further, the channel options - may include a site of a merchant offering a deal, a site of the service provider , a site of the deal sourcer , a deals site, an online retailer site, a content sharing site, a social networking site, a micro-blogging site, search engine sites, combinations thereof, and so on.

In some cases, the channel options - may include one or more client device applications (e.g. mobile device apps), one or more web-based applications, one or more application programming interfaces (APIs), combinations thereof, and the like.","In some situations, one or more of the channel options - may be configured to operate in an online mode, while one or more additional channel options - may be configured to operate in an offline mode. For example, the channel option  may be utilized by individuals to acquire deals and\/or acquire items in association with the deals from the service provider  when respective client devices of the individuals are coupled to a network, such as a local area network, a wide area network, and the like. In another example, the channel option  may be utilized by individuals to acquire deals and\/or acquire items in association with the deals from the service provider  when the respective client devices of the individuals are not connected to a local area network, a wide area network, and so forth. In the offline scenarios, the respective client devices of individuals may store information regarding transactions that take place when the respective client devices are not connected to one or more particular networks, and then exchange the stored information related to the transactions when the respective client devices become connected to one or more particular networks.","Although, the illustrative example of  shows a particular number of channels and a particular number of channel options, the architecture  may include any number of channels and\/or channel options. In addition, channels and\/or channel options may be added to the architecture . Thus, the architecture  is extensible and the service provider , merchants, individuals, third-parties, or combinations thereof, may be involved in adding channels and\/or channel options to the architecture .","In a particular implementation, at , the service provider  determines one or more channel options - to be utilized for at least one of the channels - with respect to the merchant  for the deal . In some cases, the service provider  may utilize various types of data to determine the respective channel options - to be utilized for the channels - with respect to the merchant  for the deal . For example, when determining the particular channel options - to associate with the respective channels -, the service provider  may consider performance of previous deals offered by the merchant . The performance of the previous deals may correspond to a number of instances of a particular deal that were acquired, a number of instances of a particular deal that were redeemed, a number of instances of a particular deal that were acquired per a number of individuals receiving information about the particular deal, combinations thereof, and the like. The service provider  may also consider number of deals of the merchant  previously offered via the service provider , channel options - utilized with respect to previous deals of the merchant , or both, when determining the channel options - to utilize with respect to the channels -. Further, the service provider  may also utilize preferences of the merchant  with respect to the channel options - for at least one of the channels - and\/or ratings of the merchant  provided by individuals, deal sourcers, etc., to determine the channel options - to associate with the channels -.","In an illustrative example, the service provider  may determine that the first channel option  is to be utilized with respect to the advertising channel  for the deal  and that the second channel option  is to be utilized with respect to the publishing channel  for the deal . To illustrate, the service provider  may determine that the first channel option  for the deal  is a smart phone and that the second channel option  for the deal  is a local deals site of the service provider . Thus, individuals may receive information about the deal  via the advertising channel  on their smart phones and access an option to acquire the deal  via the publishing channel  on the local deals site of the service provider . The service provider  may also determine one or more of the channel options - to utilize with respect to the acquisition channel , the redemption channel , and the return\/refund channel . In some cases, the channel options - associated with one or more of the channels - may be the same, while in other cases, the channel options - associated with one or more of the channels - may be different.","Additionally, the service provider  may determine that different channel options - are associated with particular channels - for different merchants. Thus, the channel options - associated with one or more of the channels - for the merchant  are different from the channel options - associated with one or more of the channels - for another merchant. Further, the channel options - associated with each channel - may vary for different deals offered by the merchant . Consequently, the channel options - determined by the service provider  for the channels - with respect to the deal  may be different from the channel options - determined by the service provider  for the channels - with respect to a different deal.","At , the service provider  may identify individuals to receive information about the deal . In some situations, the service provider  may analyze data about a number of individuals to determine whether the individuals may have some interest in acquiring the deal . In certain cases, the individuals may have requested and\/or opted-in to receiving information about deals provided by the service provider . In a particular implementation, the service provider  may analyze data to identify individuals to receive information about the deal  that includes deal acquisition history of the individuals, item acquisition history of the individuals, payment instrument transaction information of the individuals, item search\/browse history of the individuals, deal search\/browse history of the individuals, search engine history of the individuals, location of the individuals, preferences of the individuals, demographic information of the individuals, profile information of the individuals, combinations thereof, and so forth.","The service provider  may also consider information regarding channel options - that is associated with the individuals in identifying individuals to receive information about the deal . To illustrate, the service provider  may analyze channel option usage history of the individuals, category of computing devices owned by the individuals, usage history of computing devices of the individuals, operating systems executing on the computing devices of the individuals, recent activity associated with computing devices of the individuals, combinations thereof, and so on. In particular, the service provider  may match channel options - associated with the individuals to the channel options - that have been determined by the service provider  with respect to the merchant  for the deal . For example, the service provider  may determine that information about the deal  will be provided via smart phone on the advertising channel . The service provider  may then determine that individuals having a smart phone are potential members of a target audience for the deal , that individuals currently operating a smart phone are potential members of a target audience for the deal, that individuals previously utilizing a smart phone to receive information about deals are potential members of a target audience for the deal , and the like.","In the illustrative example of , the service provider  may determine that one or more of individuals - are to receive information about the deal . Each of the individuals - may operate at least one respective client device represented by client devices -. The client devices - may include a laptop computer, a desktop computer, a smart phone, an electronic reader device, a mobile handset, a personal digital assistant (PDA), a portable navigation device, a portable gaming device, a tablet computer, a watch, a portable media player, another client device, combinations thereof, and the like.","After identifying individuals to receive information about the deal , at , the service provider  may provide information about the deal  to the individuals via one or more of the channel options -. For example, the service provider  may provide information about the deal  to the individuals - via the advertising channel . In a particular implementation, the service provider  may utilize one or more of the channel options - to provide the information about the deal , such as a smart phone, a site of the service provider, a social networking site, and the like, to the individuals -. The service provider  may also provide information about the deal  to the individuals - via the publishing channel  utilizing one or more of the channel options -. In these situations, the service provider  may also provide an input option that is selectable to initiate a transaction to acquire the deal .","At , the service provider  may conduct transactions with respect to the deal  via one or more of the channel options - for at least one of the individuals included in the target audience for the deal . The transactions may include one or more transactions to acquire the deal  where communications are exchanged with respect to the transactions via the acquisition channel . The transactions conducted by the service provider  with respect to the deal  may also include one or more transactions to acquire items in association with the deal. In certain implementations, when items associated with the deal  may be acquired from an online retail site of the service provider  and\/or when a site of the merchant  receives ecommerce services from the service provider , the service provider  may participate in transactions to acquire items in association with the deal . The communications exchanged during transactions to acquire items in association with the deal  may take place with respect to the redemption channel . Further, the service provider  may conduct transactions related to the return and refund of the deal  and\/or transactions related to the return and refund of items acquired in association with the deal. The communications associated with transactions related to the return and\/or refund of the deal  and\/or items acquired in association with the deal  may be exchanged via the return\/refund channel .","In certain implementations, the service provider  may provide incentives for individuals, such as the individuals -, to utilize particular channel options - and\/or to utilize multiple channel options - with respect to the channels -. For example, the service provider  may provide discounts, provide promotions (e.g. promotional points), and so forth, on deals and\/or items acquired via certain channel options -. In some cases, the service provider  may monitor usage by an individual of the channel options - and provide incentives for the individual to utilize one or more channel options - that the individual has not previously utilized above a threshold level. To illustrate, the service provider  may determine that an individual has not utilized an electronic reader device to acquire a threshold number of deals. Accordingly, the service provider  may provide incentives to the individual to acquire deals via the electronic reader device. Further, the service provider  may provide incentives for individuals to utilize multiple channel options - with respect to the channels -. Thus, the service provider  may provide incentives for individuals to acquire a deal via a first channel option and redeem the deal via a second channel option that is different from the first channel option. In other cases, the service provider  may offer incentives for individuals to acquire different deals via different channel options -, to redeem different deals via different channel options -, and so forth.","In some cases, the service provider  may associate particular channel options - with individuals and\/or merchants based on certain factors related to the service provider  offering the channel options - with respect to the individuals and\/or merchants. To illustrate, the cost of providing some channel options - may be lower than the cost of providing other channel options -. Accordingly, the service provider  may more frequently associate one or more respective channel options - with individuals and\/or merchants that have a lower cost to the service provider  than the other channel options -. In another illustration, the service provider  may manage communications with respect to certain channel options -, while a third-party manages communications with respect to other channel options -. In these scenarios, the service provider  may associate certain channel options - with individuals and\/or merchants more often when the channel options - are managed by the service provider .","Example Frameworks",{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0043","num":"0042"},"figref":"FIG. 2","b":["200","200","202","204","202","206","204","206","208","210","212","214","216","208","216","218","206","206","218","206","218","206","218","218","208","216","220"]},"The framework  also includes one or more data sources represented by data source .

When the service provider  receives an indication that content related to the deal items has been shared, such as via a site of the service provider  or via a third-party site, the advertising channel module  may provide information about the deal to the entity providing the indication that the content related to the deal items has been shared. The information about the deal may then be displayed when additional individuals access the content and\/or when the particular individuals capturing the deals related content share the content in a communication to others. In some instances, the advertising channel module  may provide the information about the deal before the deal has been launched, such as to a third-party site, and the third-party site can provide the deal information upon the sharing of content including items related to the deal. The service provider  and\/or the third-party content sharing site may determine that shared content includes items associated with a particular deal by analyzing tagging related to the shared content, via recognition techniques (e.g. image recognition, audio recognition, etc.), and the like. Accordingly, the service provider  may compare data of shared content with data about one or more items related to a particular deal to determine whether the shared content matches the one or more items of the deal.","The memory  also stores a publishing channel module  that is executable by the processor  to provide input options that are selectable to acquire deals via one or more channel options associated with a publishing channel. For example, the publishing channel module  may provide one or more user interfaces via one or more sites of the service provider , sites of merchants offering deals, certain mobile device apps, combinations thereof, and the like, that include input options that are selectable to acquire respective deals. In certain situations, the sites may be accessible to particular devices and\/or particular individuals. In some cases, the user interfaces may include information about the deal, such as terms of the deals, information about items related to the deals, information about merchants offering the deals, combinations thereof, and so forth.
