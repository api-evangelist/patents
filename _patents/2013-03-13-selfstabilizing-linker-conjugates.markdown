The linker component of ADCs is one important feature in developing optimized therapeutic agents that are highly active at well tolerated doses. The electrophilic maleimide functional group has proven very useful in the preparation of ADCs due to its high degree of specificity for reacting with thiol groups and the very fast thiol addition kinetics under gentle conditions.",{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0004","num":"0003"},"chemistry":{"@attributes":{"id":"CHEM-US-00001","num":"00001"},"img":{"@attributes":{"id":"EMI-C00001","he":"45.89mm","wi":"75.86mm","file":"US09504756-20161129-C00001.TIF","alt":"embedded image","img-content":"chem","img-format":"tif"}}}},"As has been noted by multiple investigators in the bioconjugate field, the thio-substituted product of the reaction between the electrophilic maleimide functional group and free thiol of antibody is subject to slow elimination, thus reversing the above reaction:",{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0006","num":"0005"},"chemistry":{"@attributes":{"id":"CHEM-US-00002","num":"00002"},"img":{"@attributes":{"id":"EMI-C00002","he":"69.00mm","wi":"75.86mm","file":"US09504756-20161129-C00002.TIF","alt":"embedded image","img-content":"chem","img-format":"tif"}}}},"When this reversible reaction occurs in a purified preparation of the ADC, the reaction is largely undetectable because the maleimide and thiol which are regenerated through the elimination process simply react again, thus reforming the intact conjugate. However, when other thiols are present, the net effect can be the transfer of the maleimide from the antibody of the ADC onto any other available thiol. This process has been documented to occur in plasma, in which the maleimide of an ADC transfers to cysteine 34 of serum albumin (Alley et al., 2008, 19, 759-765). This process has also been reported when an ADC is incubated in the presence of excess cysteine or glutathione (Jununtula et al., 2012). The present invention provides, inter alia, bioconjugates that do not undergo this transfer reaction.","The invention provides inter alia, Linkers, Drug-Linkers, Ligand-Drug Conjugates, Ligand-Linker Conjugates, Ligand-Functional Agent Conjugates, and Functional Agent-Linkers, and methods of preparing and using them. The Ligand-Drug Conjugates are stable in circulation, yet capable of inflicting cell death once released in the vicinity or within tumor cells.","Abbreviations and Definitions","Unless stated otherwise, the following terms and phrases as used herein are intended to have the following meanings.

An intact antibody has primarily two regions: a variable region and a constant region. The variable region binds to and interacts with a target antigen. The variable region includes a complementary determining region (CDR) that recognizes and binds to a specific binding site on a particular antigen. The constant region may be recognized by and interact with the immune system (see, e.g., Janeway et al., 20015th Ed., Garland Publishing, New York). An antibody can be of any type (e.g., IgG, IgE, IgM, IgD, and IgA), class (e.g., IgG1, IgG2, IgG3, IgG4, IgA1 and IgA2) or subclass. The antibody can be derived from any suitable species. In some embodiments, the antibody is of human or murine origin. An antibody can be, for example, human, humanized or chimeric.","The term \u201cmonoclonal antibody\u201d as used herein refers to an antibody obtained from a population of substantially homogeneous antibodies, i.e., the individual antibodies comprising the population are identical except for possible naturally-occurring mutations that may be present in minor amounts. Monoclonal antibodies are highly specific, being directed against a single antigenic site. The modifier \u201cmonoclonal\u201d indicates the character of the antibody as being obtained from a substantially homogeneous population of antibodies, and is not to be construed as requiring production of the antibody by any particular method.","An \u201cintact antibody\u201d is one which comprises an antigen-binding variable region as well as a light chain constant domain (C) and heavy chain constant domains, C1, C2, C3 and C4, as appropriate for the antibody class. The constant domains may be native sequence constant domains (e.g., human native sequence constant domains) or amino acid sequence variant thereof.","An \u201cantibody fragment\u201d comprises a portion of an intact antibody, comprising the antigen-binding or variable region thereof. Examples of antibody fragments include Fab, Fab\u2032, F(ab\u2032), and Fv fragments, diabodies, triabodies, tetrabodies, linear antibodies, single-chain antibody molecules, scFv, scFv-Fc, multispecific antibody fragments formed from antibody fragment(s), a fragment(s) produced by a Fab expression library, or an epitope-binding fragments of any of the above which immunospecifically bind to a target antigen (e.g., a cancer cell antigen, a viral antigen or a microbial antigen).","An \u201cantigen\u201d is an entity to which an antibody specifically binds.","The terms \u201cspecific binding\u201d and \u201cspecifically binds\u201d mean that the antibody or antibody derivative will bind, in a highly selective manner, with its corresponding target antigen and not with the multitude of other antigens. Typically, the antibody or antibody derivative binds with an affinity of at least about 1\u00d710M, and preferably 10M to le M, 10M, 10M, or 10M and binds to the predetermined antigen with an affinity that is at least two-fold greater than its affinity for binding to a non-specific antigen (e.g., BSA, casein) other than the predetermined antigen or a closely-related antigen.","The term \u201cinhibit\u201d or \u201cinhibition of\u201d means to a reduce by a measurable amount, or to prevent entirely.","The term \u201ctherapeutically effective amount\u201d refers to an amount of a drug effective to treat a disease or disorder in a mammal.

To the extent the drug may inhibit growth and\/or kill existing cancer cells, it may be cytostatic and\/or cytotoxic. For cancer therapy, efficacy can, for example, be measured by assessing the time to disease progression (TTP) and\/or determining the response rate (RR).","The term \u201csubstantial\u201d or \u201csubstantially\u201d refers to a majority, i.e. >50% of a population, of a mixture or a sample, preferably more than 50%, 55%, 60%, 65%, 70%, 75%, 80%, 85%, 90%, 91%, 92%, 93%, 94%, 95%, 96%, 97%, 98%, or 99% of a population.","The terms \u201cintracellularly cleaved\u201d and \u201cintracellular cleavage\u201d refer to a metabolic process or reaction inside a cell on a Ligand Drug conjugate (e.g., an Antibody Drug Conjugate (ADC) or the like), whereby the covalent attachment, e.g., the linker, between the Drug moiety (D) and the Ligand unit (e.g., an antibody (Ab)) is broken, resulting in the free Drug, or other metabolite of the conjugate dissociated from the antibody inside the cell. The cleaved moieties of the Drug-Linker-Ligand conjugate are thus intracellular metabolites.","The term \u201ccytotoxic activity\u201d refers to a cell-killing, a cytostatic or an anti-proliferative effect of a Drug-Linker-Ligand conjugate compound or an intracellular metabolite of a Drug-Linker-Ligand conjugate.

The rate of this reaction is influenced by electrophilicity of the carbonyls, which can vary with the substitution of electron-donating or electron-withdrawing groups present on the nitrogen of the imide group. The rate of the hydrolysis reaction is also influenced by the pH of an aqueous solvent, which effectively increases the nucleophilicity of water with increasing pH. It has been discovered by the present inventors that the placement of a basic group on an N-substituted maleimide also increases the rate of the hydrolysis. By careful engineering of an N-substituent group on the maleimide, the combination of its electron withdrawing influence on the maleimide ring (thus increasing its electrophilicity) and localized basicity (increasing the effective nucleophilicity of nearby water) can be used to tune the rate of hydrolysis of either the parent maleimide or its thio-substituted succinimide derivative. The present invention provides, inter alia, N-substituted maleimides with hydrolysis rates that fall within a useful range wherein their reaction with thiols occurs more quickly than their hydrolysis to the maleic acid derivative, but which yield thio-substituted succinimides with hydrolysis rates that are sufficiently rapid to achieve complete hydrolysis under gentle conditions that are very suitable for the manufacture of protein-based bioconjugates.","The present invention is based, in part, on the discovery that a basic functional group proximal to a maleimide will catalyze the hydrolysis of a thio-substituted succinimide which is formed upon conjugation of the maleimide and a protein thiol leading to a stable bioconjugate. By further combining a proximal basic group with an electron withdrawing group, the rate of thio-substituted succinimide ring hydrolysis can be tuned to a desirable level. Design parameters that affect the rate of hydrolysis include the pKa of the basic group, the strength of the electron withdrawing group when present, and the proximity of both groups to the maleimide carbonyl carbons. Design parameters that affect the percentage hydrolysis include the nature and proximity of the base to the maleimide carbonyl carbons.","Conceptually, without limiting the invention, a Linker unit comprising a self-stabilizing linker assembly is referred to herein as a Self-Stabilizing Linker or Self-Stabilizing Linker unit. The Self-Stabilizing Linker prior to conjugation with the Ligand unit comprises a maleimide group. The Self-Stabilizing Linker is self-stabilizing by virtue of the proximity of the maleimide group to a base within the Linker unit which catalyzes the hydrolysis of its own thio-substituted succinimide after conjugation to the Ligand unit.

In some aspects, a Ligand-Functional Agent is provided wherein D\u2032 is a Detection Unit or Stabilizing unit and the Ligand unit is a protein (e.g., a non-antibody protein).","In some aspects, a Ligand unit forms a bond with the maleimide of the Self-Stabilizing Basic unit via a sulfhydryl group of the Ligand to form a thio-substituted succinimide. The sulfhydryl group can be present on the Ligand in the Ligand's natural state, for example a naturally-occurring antibody, or can be introduced into the Ligand via chemical modification.","It has been observed for bioconjugates that the site of drug conjugation can affect a number of parameters including ease of conjugation, drug-linker stability, effects on biophysical properties of the resulting bioconjugates, and in-vitro cytotoxicity. With respect to drug-linker stability, the site of conjugation of a drug-linker to a ligand can affect the ability of the conjugated drug-linker to undergo an elimination reaction and for the drug linker to be transferred from the ligand of a bioconjugate to an alternative reactive thiol present in the milieu of the bioconjugate, such as, for example, a reactive thiol in albumin, free cysteine, or glutathione when in plasma. Use of the Self-Stabilizing Linkers of the present invention is particularly beneficial when conjugated to thiol residues at sites that are susceptible to the elimination reaction and subsequent transfer of drug-linker if non-self-stabilizing alkyl maleimides are used (e.g., maleimido-caproyl drug linker). Such sites include, for example, the interchain disulfides as well as select cysteine engineered sites. Use of the Self-Stabilizing Linkers of the present invention provides a stable linkage and ability to attach multiple drugs to each Ligand unit.","In one aspect, the Ligand unit has one or more lysine residues that can be chemically modified to introduce one or more sulfhydryl groups. The reagents that can be used to modify lysines include, but are not limited to, N-succinimidyl S-acetylthioacetate (SATA) and 2-Iminothiolane hydrochloride (Traut's Reagent).","In another embodiment, the Ligand unit can have one or more carbohydrate groups that can be chemically modified to have one or more sulfhydryl groups.","In another embodiment, the sulfhydryl groups is be generated by reduction of the interchain disulfides. Accordingly, in some embodiments, the Linker unit is conjugated to a cysteine residue of the reduced interchain disulfides.","In another embodiment, the sulfhydryl group is chemically introduced into the antibody, for example by introduction of a cysteine residue. Accordingly, in some embodiments, the Linker unit is conjugated to an introduced cysteine residue.","Useful non-immunoreactive protein, polypeptide, or peptide Ligands include, but are not limited to, transferrin, epidermal growth factors (\u201cEGF\u201d), bombesin, gastrin, gastrin-releasing peptide, platelet-derived growth factor, IL-2, IL-6, transforming growth factors (\u201cTGF\u201d), such as TGF-\u03b1 and TGF-\u03b2, vaccinia growth factor (\u201cVGF\u201d), insulin and insulin-like growth factors I and II, somatostatin, lectins and apoprotein from low density lipoprotein.","Particularly preferred ligands are antibodies. Useful polyclonal antibodies are heterogeneous populations of antibody molecules derived from the sera of immunized animals. Useful monoclonal antibodies are homogeneous populations of antibodies to a particular antigenic determinant (e.g., a cancer cell antigen, a viral antigen, a microbial antigen, a protein, a peptide, a carbohydrate, a chemical, nucleic acid, or fragments thereof). A monoclonal antibody (mAb) to an antigen-of-interest can be prepared by using any technique known in the art which provides for the production of antibody molecules by continuous cell lines in culture.","Useful monoclonal antibodies include, but are not limited to, human monoclonal antibodies, humanized monoclonal antibodies, or chimeric human-mouse (or other species) monoclonal antibodies. The antibodies include full-length antibodies and antigen binding fragments thereof. Human monoclonal antibodies may be made by any of numerous techniques known in the art (e.g., Teng et al., 198380:7308-7312; Kozbor et al., 19834:72-79; and Olsson et al., 198292:3-16).","The antibody can be a functionally active fragment, derivative or analog of an antibody that immunospecifically binds to target cells (e.g., cancer cell antigens, viral antigens, or microbial antigens) or other antibodies bound to tumor cells or matrix. In this regard, \u201cfunctionally active\u201d means that the fragment, derivative or analog is able to elicit anti-anti-idiotype antibodies that recognize the same antigen that the antibody from which the fragment, derivative or analog is derived. Specifically, in an exemplary embodiment the antigenicity of the idiotype of the immunoglobulin molecule can be enhanced by deletion of framework and CDR sequences that are C-terminal to the CDR sequence that specifically recognizes the antigen. To determine which CDR sequences bind the antigen, synthetic peptides containing the CDR sequences can be used in binding assays with the antigen by any binding assay method known in the art (e.g., the BIA core assay) (See, e.g., Kabat et al., 1991, Fifth Edition, National Institute of Health, Bethesda, Md.; Kabat E et al., 1980125(3):961-969).","Other useful antibodies include fragments of antibodies such as, but not limited to, F(ab\u2032)fragments, Fab fragments, Fvs, single chain antibodies, diabodies, tribodies, tetrabodies, scFv, scFv-FV, or any other molecule with the same specificity as the antibody.","Additionally, recombinant antibodies, such as chimeric and humanized monoclonal antibodies, comprising both human and non-human portions, which can be made using standard recombinant DNA techniques, are useful antibodies. A chimeric antibody is a molecule in which different portions are derived from different animal species, such as for example, those having a variable region derived from a murine monoclonal and human immunoglobulin constant regions.

In such aspects, the Stretcher unit is capable of linking the self-stabilizing linker assembly to the Detection unit or the Stabilizing unit.","Drug Loading","The number of self-stabilizing linkers per Ligand is represented by p. In embodiments wherein the linkers are not branched, p represents the number of drug-linker molecules (or detection-linker or stability-linker molecules) per Ligand (e.g., antibody). Depending on the context, p can represent the average number of self-stabilizing linkers per Ligand (or in embodiments where the linkers are not branched, the average number of drug-linker molecules (or detection-linker or stability-linker molecules) per Ligand (e.g., antibody)). The variable p ranges from 1 to 20, typically 1 to 12, 1 to 10 and is preferably from 1 to 8. In some preferred embodiments, when p represents the average number of self-stabilizing linkers per antibody, p ranges from about 2 to about 5. In some embodiments, p is about 2, about 4, or about 8. In some preferred embodiments, when p represents the average number of drug-linker molecules per antibody, p ranges from about 2 to about 5. In some embodiments, p is about 2, about 4, or about 8. The number of D\u2032 per self-stabilizing linkers is represented by u. u ranges from 1 to 10.","The average number of Drugs units per Ligand unit in a preparation from a conjugation reaction may be characterized by conventional means such as mass spectroscopy, ELISA assay, HIC and HPLC. The quantitative distribution of Drug-Linker-Ligand conjugates in terms of p may also be determined. In some instances, separation, purification, and characterization of homogeneous Ligand-Drug Conjugates, where p is a certain value from Ligand-Drug Conjugate with other drug loadings may be achieved by means such as reverse phase HPLC or electrophoresis.","Self-Stabilizing Linker Assembly (Lor L) and Rates of Hydrolysis","The Self-Stabilizing linker assembly links the Ligand unit to a Stretcher unit if the Stretcher unit is present, links the Ligand unit to a Cleavable unit if the Stretcher unit is absent and a Cleavable unit is present, links the Ligand unit to a Spacer unit if the Stretcher unit and the Cleavable unit are absent and the Spacer unit is present, or links the Ligand Unit to D\u2032 (e.g., a Drug Unit) if the Stretcher unit, Cleavable unit and Spacer unit are absent. In some embodiments, the Stretcher unit, Cleavable unit, and Spacer unit will be absent and the self-stabilizing linker assembly will be conjugated directly to D\u2032 (e.g., a Drug Unit). In other embodiments, one or more of the Stretcher unit, Cleavable unit, and Spacer unit will be present.","The rate at which the thio-substituted succinimide of the Self-Stabilizing Linker when part of a Ligand-Drug Conjugate undergoes hydrolysis can be quantified using the t1\/2 of hydrolysis. t1\/2 of hydrolysis refers to the time taken for half of the compound of interest to hydrolyze, i.e., undergo a ring opening, under stated conditions (e.g., pH 7.4 and 22\u00b0 C.). In some embodiments of the present invention, the t1\/2 of hydrolysis of the thio-substituted succinimide of the Self-Stabilizing unit is less than 4 hours, preferably less than 3 hours, even more preferably, less than 2 hours, less than 1 hour, less than 45 minutes, less than 30 minutes, less than 15 minutes using the following assay and stated conditions.","The hydrolysis reaction rates of maleimido drug linkers following conjugation to antibody cysteines can be determined by mass spectrometry, as the hydrolyzed product has a molecular weight 18 daltons greater than the unhydrolyzed conjugate. Reduction of the interchain disulfides of a human IgG1 creates a single reduced cysteine on the light chain and three reduced cysteines on the heavy chain. The self-stabilizing maleimide drug-linker can then be conjugated to the reduced antibody at pH 7.4 and 22\u00b0 C. and introduced to a high-resolution electrospray mass spectrometer via a reversed-phase HPLC column which separates the conjugated light and heavy chains. The masses of the conjugated light and heavy chains can thus be measured, and the peak intensities determined by standard mass spectrometry data processing software (e.g., MassLynx). By performing a series of injections over time, the disappearance of the peak corresponding to the mass of the original, unhydrolyzed conjugate and the appearance of the peak corresponding to the mass of the hydrolyzed conjugate can be monitored, the intensities of the peaks determined, and the percentage of hydrolyzed conjugate calculated at each timepoint. By plotting the hydrolysis percentage versus time, a curve is generated (e.g., using PRISM) which can be fit to a standard equation for exponential phenomena which includes a parameter for t1\/2.","In some aspects, the Self-Stabilizing Linker will be designed such that the maleimide component of the Self-Stabilizing Linker does not substantially undergo hydrolysis prior to conjugation to the Ligand unit.","In some embodiments of the present invention, the t1\/2 of hydrolysis of the thio-substituted succinimide of the Self-Stabilizing Linker is from about 5 or about 10 minutes to about 24 hours, preferably from about 5 or about 10 minutes to about 12 hours, more preferably from about 5 or about 10 minutes to about 5 hours, more preferably from about 5 or about 10 minutes to about 2.5 hours, even more preferably from about 5 or about 10 minutes to about 1 hour, even more preferably from about 5 or about 10 minutes to about 30 minutes, even more preferably from about 5 or about 10 minutes to about 20 minutes, and even more preferably from about 10 minutes to about 15 minutes at a pH of about 7 to about 7.5 (e.g., 7.4) and a temperature of about 22\u00b0 C.","In some such embodiments wherein the t1\/2 of hydrolysis is as stated above, the hydrolysis goes to completion. Complete hydrolysis is considered to be achieved if 90% of the thio-substituted succinimide hydrolyzes. Preferably, 95% or greater, 96%, 97%, 98%, 99% or 100% hydrolysis will be achieved. In some embodiments, the hydrolysis reaction will compete with a dilactam formation and will not achieve completion. In some such embodiments, at least 90% of the reaction product will be a combination of either a hydrolyzed thio-substituted succinimide Ligand-Drug Conjugate or a thio-substituted dilactam Ligand-Drug Conjugate. Preferably at least 95% or greater, 96%, 97%, 98%, 99% or 100% of the reaction product will be a combination of either a hydrolyzed thio-substituted Ligand-Drug Conjugate or a thio-substituted dilactam Ligand-Drug Conjugate. The percentage of hydrolysis can be calculated from the mass spectrometric data of the conjugate at the final timepoint by determining the intensity of the peak corresponding to the mass of the original, unhydrolyzed conjugate and the intensity of the peak corresponding to the mass of the hydrolyzed conjugate, and using the sum of the peak intensities to determine the percentage hydrolyzed and percentage unhydrolyzed.","In addition to characterizing the Ligand-Drug Conjugate by its t1\/2 of hydrolysis and\/or the efficiency of the hydrolysis reaction, the stability of the Ligand-Drug Conjugate can be characterized by the ability of the Ligand-Drug Conjugate to undergo an elimination reaction and for the Drug-Linker to be transferred from the Ligand unit to an alternative reactive thiol present in the milieu of the Ligand-Drug Conjugate. In some embodiments, the Drug-Linker will exhibit no or substantially no disassociation from the Ligand under the following assay and stated conditions. The phrase \u201csubstantially no disassociation from the Ligand\u201d is considered to be achieved if less than 40%, preferably less than 20%, even more preferably less than 10%, or even more preferably less than 5% or less than 2% of the Drug-Linker in a sample disassociates from the Ligand.","The elimination of a drug-linker containing an enzyme-cleavable linker from an antibody can be measured in ex vivo plasma by the following method. The conjugate is placed in sterile plasma and incubated at 37\u00b0 C. At the begirming of the incubation and at varying timepoints from 1 hour to 1 week or longer, an aliquot is removed at frozen at \u221280\u00b0 C. Upon completion of the timepoints, the samples are passed over a protein A affinity resin to capture the antibody, the resin is washed with buffer, and then drug is released from the captured antibody by treatment with an appropriate enzyme (e.g. papain or proteinase K for peptide-based cleavable linkers). The released drug can then be quantified by standard LC-MS methodology, and the quantity of drug measured at each timepoint divided by the quantity of drug measured for the pre-incubation aliquot to determine the percentage of drug remaining conjugated to the antibody at each timepoint. The precision of this assay can be improved by including an internal standard antibody-drug conjugate which is prepared using an isotopically labeled version of the same drug-linker, such that the drug which is released from it can be detected independently in the LC-MS assay from the drug released from the test drug-linker by virtue of its mass difference. This isotopically labeled internal standard antibody-drug conjugate is added to each sample in equal amounts immediately prior to the protein A capture step. The quantitation of the drug released from the test ADC is then performed ratiometrically to the signal from the internal standard by conventional LC-MS techniques.","An alternative method for evaluating the elimination of a maleimide drug-linker from an antibody (or other ligand) is to incubate the conjugate in buffer (e.g., phosphate-buffered saline) at slightly elevated pH (e.g., pH 8.0) in the presence of a large excess of a small-molecule thiol (e.g., N-acetyl cysteine, NAC) which will react with any maleimide that eliminates from the parent conjugate. LC-MS assays can be performed to detect and quantify the drug-linker conjugated to NAC, or the parent ligand-conjugate. In the latter case, the ratio of the ligand-conjugate to unconjugated ligand can be measured and will remain constant over time if the ligand-conjugate is stable. Additional methods are provided in the examples section.","Treatment of Cancer","The Ligand-Drug Conjugates are useful for inhibiting the multiplication of a tumor cell or cancer cell, causing apoptosis in a tumor or cancer cell, or for treating cancer in a patient. The Ligand-Drug Conjugates can be used accordingly in a variety of settings for the treatment of cancers. The Ligand-Drug Conjugates can be used to deliver a drug to a tumor cell or cancer cell. Without being bound by theory, in one embodiment, the Ligand unit of a Ligand-Drug Conjugate binds to or associates with a cancer-cell or a tumor-cell-associated antigen, and the Ligand-Drug Conjugate can be taken up (internalized) inside a tumor cell or cancer cell through receptor-mediated endocytosis or other internalization mechanism. The antigen can be attached to a tumor cell or cancer cell or can be an extracellular matrix protein associated with the tumor cell or cancer cell. Once inside the cell, via a cleavable or non-cleavable mechanism, depending upon the components of the linker system, the drug is released within the cell. In an alternative embodiment, the Drug or Drug unit is cleaved from the Ligand-Drug Conjugate outside the tumor cell or cancer cell, and the Drug or Drug unit subsequently penetrates the cell.","The Ligand-Drug Conjugates can provide conjugation-specific tumor or cancer drug targeting, thus reducing general toxicity of the drug. In some embodiments, the Linker units stabilize the Ligand-Drug Conjugates in blood, yet are capable of liberating drug once inside the cell.","In one embodiment, the Ligand unit binds to the tumor cell or cancer cell.","In another embodiment, the Ligand unit binds to a tumor cell or cancer cell antigen which is on the surface of the tumor cell or cancer cell.","In another embodiment, the Ligand unit binds to a tumor cell or cancer cell antigen which is an extracellular matrix protein associated with the tumor cell or cancer cell.","The specificity of the Ligand unit for a particular tumor cell or cancer cell can be important for determining those tumors or cancers that are most effectively treated. For example, a ligand drug conjugate having a BR96Ligand unit can be useful for treating antigen positive carcinomas including those of the lung, breast, colon, ovaries, and pancreas. Ligand-Drug Conjugates having an anti-CD30 or an anti-CD70 binding Ligand unit can be useful for treating hematologic malignancies.","Other particular types of cancers that can be treated with a ligand drug conjugates include, but are not limited to, those disclosed in Table 1:",{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0334","num":"0450"},"tables":{"@attributes":{"id":"TABLE-US-00002","num":"00002"},"table":{"@attributes":{"frame":"none","colsep":"0","rowsep":"0"},"tgroup":{"@attributes":{"align":"left","colsep":"0","rowsep":"0","cols":"1"},"colspec":{"@attributes":{"colname":"1","colwidth":"217pt","align":"left"}},"thead":{"row":[{"entry":"TABLE 1"},{"entry":{"@attributes":{"namest":"1","nameend":"1","align":"center","rowsep":"1"}}}]},"tbody":{"@attributes":{"valign":"top"},"row":[{"entry":"Solid tumors, including but not limited to:"},{"entry":"fibrosarcoma, myxosarcoma, liposarcoma, chondrosarcoma, "},{"entry":"osteogenic sarcoma, chordoma, angiosarcoma, endotheliosarcoma,"},{"entry":"lymphangiosarcoma, lymphangioendotheliosarcoma, synovioma,"},{"entry":"mesothelioma, Ewing's tumor, leiomyosarcoma, rhabdomyosarcoma,"},{"entry":"colon cancer, colorectal cancer, kidney cancer, pancreatic cancer, "},{"entry":"bone cancer, breast cancer, ovarian cancer, prostate cancer,"},{"entry":"esophogeal cancer, stomach cancer, oral cancer, nasal cancer, throat"},{"entry":"cancer, squamous cell carcinoma, basal cell carcinoma, "},{"entry":"adenocarcinoma, sweat gland carcinoma, sebaceous gland carcinoma, "},{"entry":"papillary carcinoma, papillary adenocarcinomas, cystadenocarcinoma, "},{"entry":"medullary carcinoma, bronchogenic carcinoma, renal cell carcinoma, "},{"entry":"hepatoma, bile duct carcinoma, choriocarcinoma, seminoma, embryonal "},{"entry":"carcinoma, Wilms' tumor, cervical cancer, uterine cancer, testicular "},{"entry":"cancer, small cell lung carcinoma, bladder carcinoma, lung cancer,"},{"entry":"epithelial carcinoma, glioma, glioblastoma multiforme, astrocytoma,"},{"entry":"medulloblastoma, craniopharyngioma, ependymoma, pinealoma,"},{"entry":"hemangioblastoma, acoustic neuroma, oligodendroglioma, meningioma, "},{"entry":"skin cancer, melanoma, neuroblastoma, retinoblastoma"},{"entry":"blood-borne cancers, including but not limited to:"},{"entry":"acute lymphoblastic leukemia \u201cALL\u201d, acute lymphoblastic "},{"entry":"B-cell leukemia, acute lymphoblastic T-cell leukemia,"},{"entry":"acute myeloblastic leukemia \u201cAML\u201d, acute promyelocytic"},{"entry":"leukemia \u201cAPL\u201d, acute monoblastic leukemia, acute"},{"entry":"erythroleukemic leukemia, acute megakaryoblastic leukemia, acute"},{"entry":"myelomonocytic leukemia, acute nonlymphocyctic leukemia, acute"},{"entry":"undifferentiated leukemia, chronic myelocytic leukemia \u201cCML\u201d, chronic"},{"entry":"lymphocytic leukemia \u201cCLL\u201d, hairy cell leukemia, multiple myeloma"},{"entry":"acute and chronic leukemias:"},{"entry":"lymphoblastic, myelogenous, lymphocytic, myelocytic leukemias"},{"entry":"Lymphomas:"},{"entry":"Hodgkin's disease, non-Hodgkin's Lymphoma, Multiple "},{"entry":"myeloma, Waldenstr\u00f6m's macroglobulinemia,"},{"entry":"Heavy chain disease, Polycythemia vera"},{"entry":{"@attributes":{"namest":"1","nameend":"1","align":"center","rowsep":"1"}}}]}}}}},"Multi-Modality Therapy for Cancer","Cancers, including, but not limited to, a tumor, metastasis, or other disease or disorder characterized by uncontrolled cell growth, can be treated or inhibited by administration of a Ligand-Drug Conjugate.","In other embodiments, methods for treating cancer are provided, including administering to a patient in need thereof an effective amount of a Ligand-Drug Conjugate and a chemotherapeutic agent.

Suitable protecting groups consist, but are not limited to, acid labile protecting groups. \u201cBoc\u201d protecting group is one of the preferred protecting group.","The first step of maleimide preparation, the formation of the maleamic acid is very facile and can be usually accomplished in good yield by slow addition of the amine to a suspension containing a stoichiometric excess of the maleic anhydride.","The second step, cyclodehydration of the maleamic acid, can be accomplished in a number of ways known to skilled in the art. For example, the use of chemical dehydrating agents has been a well established method for accomplishing this step. Carbodiimides in combination with isomerizing alcohols, for example: DCC\/HOBt, have been used to effect cyclodehydration of amic acids to maleimides.","Thermal cyclodehydration with use of azeotropic distillation in the presence of acid catalyst is another well known method to generate maleimides. The use of an azeotropic solvent permits the efficient removal of the water co-product as it forms, thereby driving reaction to maleimide. Suitable azeotropic solvents include cyclohexane, benzene, toluene, ethylbensene, mesitylene, and the like. Toluene is considered to be the most desirable since it boils at 110\u00b0 C. at atmospheric pressure. Boiling temperatures below 200\u00b0 C. are preferable to minimize possible thermal isomerization of maleamic acid to the more thermodynamically stable trans (fumaramic acid) structure.","The use of polar aprotic co-solvents can be beneficial for overall yield improvement as well as reducing time of cyclodehydration. Several polar aprotic solvents including dimethylformamide, dimethylacetamide, acetonitrile, N-methylpyrrolidone, dimethylsulfoxide, and sulfonate have been claimed to be useful. The most useful polar aprotic solvent is dimethylformamide.","Incorporation of certain amine salts instead of aprotic solvents can be further beneficial for maleimide formation according to U.S. Pat.

When a conjugate is prepared by fully reducing the interchain disulfides of a human IgG1 antibody and conjugating the maleimide to the resulting cysteines, each light chain of the antibody will contain a single maleimide modification and each heavy chain will contain three maleimide modifications (see , top). Upon complete hydrolysis of the resulting thiosuccinimides, the mass of the light chain will therefore increase by 18 Daltons, while the mass of the heavy chain will increase by 54 Daltons. This is illustrated in  (bottom), with the conjugation and subsequent hydrolysis of a self-stabilizing maleimide drug-linker of the present invention (mDPR-Val-Cit-PAB-MMAE, molecular weight 1289 Da) to the fully reduced anti-CD30 antibody cAC10. The presence of the single N-linked glycosylation site on the heavy chain results in the heterogeneity of masses observed in the unconjugated antibody.","By monitoring the intensities of the non-hydrolyzed and hydrolyzed peaks in the mass spectrum of a self-stabilizing bioconjugate over time (mDPR-Val-Cit-PAB-MMAE), the hydrolysis kinetics can be evaluated. This is done by plotting the percent of the total population which has hydrolyzed at each timepoint versus time (, top). These data are then fit to the exponential equation\n\n\u00d7(1)\n\nwhere Y is the observed percent hydrolysis at time t, Ymax is the asymptotic maximal % hydrolysis, and K is the hydrolysis rate constant. The half-life for the hydrolysis reaction is defined as\n\n=ln(2)\/\n","When this procedure is performed on the light chain of a reduced hIgG1 antibody, the analysis is quite straightforward as there is only one conjugation site per light chain and the reaction is a simple progression from the unhydrolyzed species to the hydrolyzed species with a mass change of 18 Daltons. Performing this analysis on the heavy chain is complicated by the fact that there are a total of three conjugation sites, resulting in a series of peaks of +18, +36, and +54 Daltons as the conjugate undergoes hydrolysis. The analysis of the heavy chain is further complicated by the presence of multiple glycoforms. The analysis presented in  was performed by only evaluating the peaks arising from the most abundant glycoform (the transition from 54195 Da to 54250 Da) and assuming that these peaks are a reasonable surrogate for the whole population of heavy chain glycoforms. As is evident in , the observed kinetic profiles for light and heavy chains are very similar. For this reason, and because of the added complexities of quantifying hydrolysis rates on the heavy chain noted above, most of the data to characterize hydrolysis rates of self-stabilizing maleimides conjugated to antibodies was determined from evaluation of the light chain hydrolysis.","One limitation of this methodology is that the electrospray ionization process tends to produce a small proportion of sodium adducts in the observed peaks (approximately 10% under the conditions used to generate the data in ), which have an observed mass 22 Daltons greater than the parent mass. Many mass spectrometers do not have sufficiently high resolution to resolve this +22 mass from the +18 mass that results from hydrolysis on a protein with a total molecular mass in excess of 25,000 Daltons. Consequently, at the early timepoints when the degree of hydrolysis is low, the appearance of a peak at approximately +20 Daltons is a combination of these two effects which cannot be easily separated experimentally. As a result, the estimate of the percent of hydrolyzed product at the earliest timepoints is probably an overestimate, but the magnitude of this effect diminishes as the reaction proceeds toward completion","It was hypothesized that the presence of a basic amino group adjacent to maleimide would accelerate the hydrolysis of thiosuccinimides prepared with those maleimides and thus result in stable bioconjugates. The distance between the maleimide and the basic amino group was recognized as an important parameter in the design of such self-stabilizing units. To evaluate the role of this spacing, a series of maleimides were prepared with the general structure",{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0466","num":"0646"},"chemistry":{"@attributes":{"id":"CHEM-US-00091","num":"00091"},"img":{"@attributes":{"id":"EMI-C00091","he":"19.30mm","wi":"55.88mm","file":"US09504756-20161129-C00091.TIF","alt":"embedded image","img-content":"chem","img-format":"tif"}}},"br":{}},"To prepare bioconjugates with faster hydrolysis rates, a series of maleimides were prepared with the general structure",{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0468","num":"0648"},"chemistry":{"@attributes":{"id":"CHEM-US-00092","num":"00092"},"img":{"@attributes":{"id":"EMI-C00092","he":"21.51mm","wi":"29.55mm","file":"US09504756-20161129-C00092.TIF","alt":"embedded image","img-content":"chem","img-format":"tif"}}},"br":{},"figref":"FIG. 4"},"The previous examples illustrate the influence that a basic group can have over the rate of succinimide ring hydrolysis in a bioconjugate, depending on the distance between the basic group and the maleimide of the parent molecule. However, it is expected that the presence of electron-withdrawing or -donating groups will also influence the rate of ring hydrolysis, since these groups will influence the electron density (and therefore electrophilicity) at the carbonyl carbons of the ring. In the conjugates of example 5, a carboxamide group is present in the alpha position relative to the nitrogen of the ring (i.e. a single carbon atom is present between the nitrogen of the ring and the carbonyl carbon of the carboxamide). Because the carboxamide is a weak electron withdrawing group, its presence is likely to influence the observed hydrolysis rates. To better understand the relative contributions of the basic amino group and the electron-withdrawing carboxamide group on the observed hydrolysis rates, a series of maleimides were conjugated to a reduced human IgG1 antibody at pH 7.4, 22\u00b0 C., and the hydrolysis rates determined by mass spectrometry (). These maleimides contained just the carboxamide in the alpha position (triangles), just the primary amine in the beta position (inverted triangles), or both the carboxamide and the primary amine (circles). A control maleimide which contained neither group in proximity to the maleimide was also evaluated, although its hydrolysis is so slow that no reaction was observed under these conditions and no data is plotted. Under these conditions the self-stabilizing maleimide which contains both the base and the electron withdrawing group produced a bioconjugate with a hydrolysis tof just 12 minutes, while the maleimide containing only the amine yielded a tof 2.5 hours, and the maleimide containing only the carboxamide yielded a tof 24 hours. This result indicates that the basic group and the electron withdrawing group act in concert to yield a conjugate with the very rapid hydrolysis kinetics which are most convenient for the manufacture of bioconjugates under the desirable mild conditions. Conjugates prepared with the diaminopropionyl maleimide (circles) exhibit ideal hydrolysis characteristics, with a tof less than 15 minutes under very gentle conditions and the reaction approaching 100% completion in about 2 hours.","The rapid and complete succinimide hydrolysis observed in conjugates prepared with self-stabilizing diaminopropionyl maleimido drug-linkers acid (DPR) shown in examples 5 and 6 above indicates the importance of both the basic group and the electron withdrawing group to the design. A second, isomeric maleimido drug-linker was prepared with diaminopropionic acid to further evaluate the role of these two components on the hydrolysis behavior of the resulting conjugates.

Both also possess an electron withdrawing carboxamide group, however the distance from the maleimido nitrogen the carboxamide varies from 1 to 2 carbon units (\u03b1 and \u03b2, respectively). Finally, the separation between the basic amine and the carboxamide also varies from 1 to 2 carbon units and a, respectively). Collectively, this means that in \u03b2-DPR the carboxamide exerts less electron withdrawing influence on the maleimide ring but more electron withdrawing influence on the primary amine, relative to \u03b1-DPR. This is expected to slow the rate of hydrolysis by reducing both the electrophilicity of the maleimide and the basicity of the primary amine. When these maleimido drug-linkers were conjugated to reduced antibody and monitored for succinimide hydrolysis, a 17-fold lower hydrolysis rate was observed for \u03b2-DPR relative to \u03b1-DPR (). This example illustrates how the relative positioning of a basic group and an electron withdrawing group can be used to \u2018tune\u2019 the hydrolysis rate.","To evaluate the stability and pharmacological activity of ADCs prepared with self-stabilizing drug-linkers, a self-stabilizing maleimido-drug-linker was prepared. This drug-linker contains the maleimido-DPR group coupled to the cytotoxic agent MMAE via a protease-cleavable val-cit PAB self-immolative group (referred to herein as maleimido-DPR-val-cit-PAB-MMAE). For comparison, a non self-stabilizing drug-linker was used (referred to herein as maleimido-caproyl-val-cit-PAB-MMAE).

However, the addition of a thiol scavenger to the buffer creates a system in which maleimide that eliminates from the bioconjugate can instead react with the scavenger, resulting in a persistent, observable loss of the maleimide from the protein. An experiment using such a system was performed with antibody-drug conjugates prepared with a self-stabilizing diaminoproprionyl (DPR) maleimido drug-linker alongside a non-stabilizing caproyl drug-linker. ADCs were prepared with 8 drugs per antibody of either maleimido-DPR-val-cit-PAB-MMAE or maleimido-caproyl-val-cit-PAB-MMAE using a fully reduced humanized IgG1. Drug loading was confirmed by reversed-phase HPLC on a polymeric PLRP\u2014S column as described previously (Sun 2005). Complete succinimide hydrolysis of the self-stabilizing linker was also confirmed by electrospray mass spectrometry. These ADCs were placed in 150 mM Tris buffer, pH 8, at 2.5 mg\/mL, containing 10 mM N-acetylcysteine as a scavenger, and incubated for 2 weeks at 37\u00b0 C. At seven timepoints during the incubation, an aliquot of each ADC was removed and frozen at \u221280\u00b0 C. Upon completion of the time-course, all samples were analyzed by the above reversed-phase HPLC method to determine the drug:antibody ratio. The results of this study are shown in . The ADC prepared with the self-stabilizing DPR maleimido drug-linker exhibited minimal loss of drug over this timecourse (from 8.0 to 7.9 drugs per antibody over 14 days), while the ADC prepared with the caproyl maleimido drug-linker lost approximately half of its drug load (from 8.0 to 3.9 drugs per antibody over 14 days) under these conditions.","Assessing drug loading of humanized ADCs in non-human plasma samples by the reversed-phase HPLC method described in Example 8 can be achieved by first isolating the ADCs with IgSelect resin (GE Healthcare), which selectively binds to the human Fc domain. ADCs were prepared with 8 drugs per antibody of either maleimido-DPR-val-cit-PAB-MMAE or maleimido-caproyl-val-cit-PAB-MMAE using a fully reduced human IgG1. These ADCs (0.25 mg\/mL) were incubated in sterile rat plasma for 7 days at 37\u00b0 C. At seven timepoints during the incubation, a 50 \u03bcL aliquot of each ADC was removed and frozen at \u221280\u00b0 C. Upon completion of the timecourse, ADCs were purified from each sample and analyzed by reversed-phase HPLC to determine the drug:antibody ratio. The results of this study are plotted in . As was observed in buffer, incubation of an ADC prepared with a self-stabilizing maleimide in rat plasma also results in little or no observable loss of drug under conditions which result in the loss of approximately half of the drug from a maleimido-caproyl ADC.","A second assay format was utilized to assess ADC stability in rat and human plasma ex vivo. ADCs were prepared with 4 drugs per antibody of either maleimido-DPR-val-cit-PAB-MMAE or maleimido-caproyl-val-cit-PAB-MMAE using a human IgG1 partially reduced to a level of 4 thiols per antibody (resulting in an ADC with 4 drugs per antibody). These two ADCs were spiked into rat and human plasma and incubated at 37\u00b0 C. for 7 days. At seven timepoints during this incubation, aliquots were removed and frozen at \u221280\u00b0 C. until completion of the timecourse. ADCs were then isolated from each sample and MMAE released proteolytically from the isolated ADCs as described previously (Sanderson 2005). The released MMAE was then quantified by LC-MS\/MS and normalized to the initial value for each ADC (). In both rat and human plasma, the ADC prepared with a self-stabilizing maleimide lost little or no drug under these conditions, while approximately half of the drug was lost from a maleimido-caproyl ADC.","As described in Example 10 above, the drug:antibody ratio can be measured for ADCs in rat plasma by reversed-phase HPLC analysis following purification with IgSelect resin. This method was applied to samples derived from an in vivo pharmacokinetic experiment in rats. ADCs were prepared with 4 drugs per antibody of either maleimido-DPR-val-cit-PAB-MMAE or maleimido-caproyl-val-cit-PAB-MMAE using a humanized IgG1 partially reduced to an average of 4 thiols per antibody (resulting in drug:antibody ratio of 4). These ADCs were further purified as described previously (Sanderson 2005) by hydrophobic interaction chromatography to isolate the species containing 4 drugs per antibody. These ADCs were dosed intravenously at 10 mg\/kg in Sprague-Dawley rats. At five timepoints, three animals from each dosing group were sacrificed and the collected blood was processed to plasma and frozen at \u221280\u00b0 C. Upon completion of the study, all samples were processed by the IgSelect resin method described above, except that the sample volume varied. The drug:antibody ratio at each timepoint in this study are plotted in . As was observed in rat plasma ex vivo, the ADC prepared with a self-stabilizing maleimide exhibits minimal loss of drug in vivo, dropping from an initial value of 4.1 drugs per antibody to a value of 3.6 drugs per antibody (12% reduction) after 7 days. During this same timeframe, the drug:antibody ratio of an ADC prepared with a maleimido-caproyl linker dropped from an initial value of 3.9 to a value of 1.5 (61% reduction).","This illustrates that the increased stability of a self-stabilizing drug-linker that is observed ex vivo translates into an in vivo setting.","Because maleimido-caproyl ADCs are prone to loss of drug through maleimide elimination whereas self-stabilizing maleimide ADCs are not, it is reasonable to predict that exposure to antibody-conjugated drug will be greater following equivalent doses of the two ADCs. To confirm this prediction, ADCs were prepared with 4 drugs per antibody of either maleimido-DPR-val-cit-PAB-MMAE or maleimido-caproyl-val-cit-PAB-MMAE using a human IgG1 partially reduced to an average of 4 thiols per antibody (resulting in drug:antibody ratio of 4). These two ADCs were dosed at 2 mg\/kg in Sprague-Dawley rats, and blood samples were taken at seven timepoints and processed to plasma. These plasma samples, along with standards of each ADC for the preparation of a calibration curve, were subjected to the mAb Select resin capture and papain release procedure described example 10 above to measure the concentration of antibody-conjugated MMAE. Antibody-conjugated drug concentrations were higher for the ADC prepared with the self-stabilizing drug-linker, with the magnitude of the difference increasing with time (data not shown). Initial antibody-conjugated drug concentrations are superimposable, reflecting the equivalence of the dose and drug:antibody ratio of the ADCs. However, divergence is observed within the first day, reaching a two-fold difference by day 3. These higher concentrations resulted in an approximately 40% greater antibody-conjugated drug AUC for the self-stabilized ADC relative to the maleimido-caproyl ADC","To assess the impact of self-stabilizing maleimides on toxicology, ADCs were prepared with 4 drugs per antibody of either maleimido-DPR-val-cit-PAB-MMAE or maleimido-caproyl-val-cit-PAB-MMAE using a humanized IgG1 (which has no known binding to any rat antigen) partially reduced to an average of 4 thiols per antibody (resulting in an average drug:antibody ratio of 4). These ADCs were dosed intravenously in female CD\u00aeIGS rats (Charles River Laboratories) at 10 mg\/kg (6 rats per test article plus 6 rats receiving vehicle only). Prior to dosing and at 3 post-dose timepoints, blood samples were taken for hematology and serum chemistry analysis for biomarkers of toxicity. Neutropenia induced by the MMAE ADC appeared less severe for the self-stabilized conjugate than for the maleimido-caproyl ADC (data not shown).","The toxicology experiment described in example 13 above also included blood draws at one hour and 24 hours post-dose, which along with the 4 day and 7 day post-dose samples were analyzed for unconjugated MMAE in plasma by LC-MS\/MS. The results of this analysis indicated that peak concentrations of circulating MMAE are about 2-fold lower for the self-stabilizing maleimido-DPR-val-cit-PAB-MMAE ADC relative to the maleimido-caproyl-val-cit-PAB-MMAE (data not shown).","To evaluate the impact of self-stabilizing drug-linkers on the antitumor activity of ADCs, conjugates were prepared with the anti-CD30 antibody cAC10 using drug-linkers containing the val-cit-PAB-MMAE cytotoxic payload linked to the antibody via either a maleimido-caproyl group or a self-stabilizing maleimido-DPR group. These ADCs were evaluated in two separate murine xenograft models of CD30+ human malignancies. In the first model (), Karpas-299 (human ALCL) cells were implanted subcutaneously in female SCID mice and tumors were allowed to grow a volume of approximately 250 mmbefore dosing at 1 mg\/kg weekly for three doses (six mice per dose group). All six mice dosed with the maleimido-caproyl ADC experienced some tumor growth delay relative to the untreated group, and two animals experienced partial tumor shrinkage; however, all tumors grew out and the entire group was euthanized with large tumors. The self-stabilizing ADC dose group experienced complete responses (no detectable tumor) in all six animals, with five animals experiencing durable regressions for the course of the study and only one animal sacrificed after its tumor had returned on study day 55. The results of this study indicate a significantly greater in vivo antitumor activity for the ADC prepared with the self-stabilizing drug-linker. In the second model, L428 (human Hodgkin Lymphoma) cells were implanted subcutaneously in female NSG mice and tumors were allowed to grow a volume of approximately 100 mmbefore dosing at 1 mg\/kg every four days for four doses (six mice per dose group). All animals in both ADC dose groups experienced significant growth delay during treatment, however all tumors began growing out after study day 28 with no significant difference between maleimido-caproyl and self-stabilizing ADCs. Thus, the improvement in antitumor activity observed with the self-stabilizing ADC in xenograft studies appears to be model-dependent."],"BRFSUM":[{},{}],"heading":["BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION","BRIEF SUMMARY OF THE INVENTION","DETAILED DESCRIPTION","Hydrolysis Enhancers (HE) and Electron-Withdrawing Groups","EXAMPLES","Example 1","Synthesis of Representative Self-Stabilizing Components","Example 2","Synthesis of mDPR-Val-Cit-PAB-MMAE","Example 3","Monitoring Thiosuccinimide Hydrolysis","Example 4","Monitoring t1\/2 Hydrolysis","Example 5","Evaluating Spacing Between the Maleimide and Basic Group of the Self-Stabilizing Linker Assembly","Example 6","Hydrolysis Kinetics","Example 7","Evaluating Spacing Between the Maleimide and Carboxamide Group of the Self-Stabilizing Linker Assembly","Examples 8-15","Example 8","Evaluating Stability of Ligand-Drug Conjugates in Buffer","Example 9","Ex Vivo Plasma Stability (Reversed Phase Method)","Example 10","Ex Vivo Plasma Stability (Conjugated Drug Method)","Example 11","In Vivo Stability","Example 12","Pharmacokinetics","Example 13","Toxicology","Example 14","Plasma Concentration of Released Drug","Example 15","Xenograft Activity"],"brief-description-of-drawings":[{},{}],"description-of-drawings":{"heading":"BRIEF DESCRIPTION OF THE DRAWINGS","p":[{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0009","num":"0008"},"figref":["FIGS. 1A and 1B","FIG. 1A","FIG. 1B"]},{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0010","num":"0009"},"figref":["FIGS. 2A and 2B","FIG. 2A","FIG. 2B"]},{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0011","num":"0010"},"figref":"FIG. 3"},{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0012","num":"0011"},"figref":"FIG. 4"},{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0013","num":"0012"},"figref":"FIG. 5"},{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0014","num":"0013"},"figref":"FIG. 6"},{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0015","num":"0014"},"figref":"FIGS. 7A and 7B"},{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0016","num":"0015"},"figref":"FIG. 8"},{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0017","num":"0016"},"figref":"FIG. 9","b":"0"},{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0018","num":"0017"},"figref":"FIG. 10"},{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0019","num":"0018"},"figref":"FIG. 11","sup":"3 "}]},"DETDESC":[{},{}]}
