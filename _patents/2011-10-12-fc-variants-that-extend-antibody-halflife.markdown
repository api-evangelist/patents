In most mammals, including humans and mice, antibodies are constructed from paired heavy and light polypeptide chains. Each chain is made up of individual immunoglobulin (Ig) domains, and thus the generic term immunoglobulin is used for such proteins. Each chain is made up of two distinct regions, referred to as the variable and constant regions. The light and heavy chain variable regions show significant sequence diversity between antibodies, and are responsible for binding the target antigen. The constant regions show less sequence diversity, and are responsible for binding a number of natural proteins to elicit important biochemical events. In humans there are five different classes of antibodies including IgA (which includes subclasses IgA1 and IgA2), IgD, IgE, IgG (which includes subclasses IgG1, IgG2, IgG3, and IgG4), and IgM. The distinguishing feature between these antibody classes is their constant regions, although subtler differences may exist in the V region. IgG antibodies are tetrameric proteins composed of two heavy chains and two light chains. The IgG heavy chain is composed of four immunoglobulin domains linked from N- to C-terminus in the order VH-CH1-CH2-CH3, referring to the heavy chain variable domain, heavy chain constant domain 1, heavy chain constant domain 2, and heavy chain constant domain 3 respectively (also referred to as VH-C\u03b31-C\u03b32-C\u03b33, referring to the heavy chain variable domain, constant gamma 1 domain, constant gamma 2 domain, and constant gamma 3 domain respectively). The IgG light chain is composed of two immunoglobulin domains linked from N- to C-terminus in the order VL-CL, referring to the light chain variable domain and the light chain constant domain respectively.","In IgG, a site on Fc between the C\u03b32 and C\u03b33 domains mediates interaction with the neonatal receptor FcRn. Binding to FcRn recycles endocytosed antibody from the endosome back to the bloodstream (Raghavan et al., 1996, Annu Rev Cell Dev Biol 12:181-220; Ghetie et al., 2000, Annu Rev Immunol 18:739-766, both entirely incorporated by reference). This process, coupled with preclusion of kidney filtration due to the large size of the full-length molecule, results in favorable antibody serum half-lives ranging from one to three weeks. Binding of Fc to FcRn also plays a key role in antibody transport. The binding site on Fc for FcRn is also the site at which the bacterial proteins A and G bind. The tight binding by these proteins is typically exploited as a means to purify antibodies by employing protein A or protein G affinity chromatography during protein purification. Thus the fidelity of this region on Fc is important for both the clinical properties of antibodies and their purification. Available structures of the rat Fc\/FcRn complex (Burmeister et al., 1994, Nature, 372:379-383; Martin et al., 2001, Mol Cell 7:867-877, both entirely incorporated by reference), and of the complexes of Fc with proteins A and G (Deisenhofer, 1981, Biochemistry 20:2361-2370; Sauer-Eriksson et al., 1995, Structure 3:265-278; Tashiro et al., 1995, Curr Opin Struct Biol 5:471-481, all entirely incorporated by reference), provide insight into the interaction of Fc with these proteins. The FcRn receptor is also responsible for the transfer of IgG to the neo-natal gut and to the lumen of the intestinal epithelia in adults (Ghetie and Ward, Annu. Rev. Immunol., 2000, 18:739-766; Yoshida et al., Immunity, 2004, 20(6):769-783, both entirely incorporated by reference).","Antibodies have serum half-lives in vivo ranging from one to three weeks. This favorable property is due to the preclusion of kidney filtration due to the large size of the full-length molecule, and interaction of the antibody Fc region with the neonatal Fc receptor FcRn. Binding to FcRn recycles endocytosed antibody from the endosome back to the bloodstream (Raghavan et al., 1996, Annu Rev Cell Dev Biol 12:181-220; Ghetie et al., 2000, Annu Rev Immunol 18:739-766, both entirely incorporated by reference).","Other properties of the antibody may determine its clearance rate (e.g. stability and half-life) in vivo. In addition to antibody binding to the FcRn receptor, other factors that contribute to clearance and half-life are serum aggregation, enzymatic degradation in the serum, inherent immunogenicity of the antibody leading to clearing by the immune system, antigen-mediated uptake, FcR (non-FcRn) mediated uptake and non-serum distribution (e.g. in different tissue compartments).","There is a need for antibody modifications that improve the pharmacokinetic properties of antibodies. The present application meets these and other needs and provides novel engineered variants in the constant regions to improve serum half-life.","Accordingly, one problem to be solved is to increase serum half life of antibodies by altering the constant domains, thus allowing the same constant regions to be used with different antigen binding sequences, e.g. the variable regions including the CDRs, and minimizing the possibility of immunogenic alterations. Thus providing antibodies with constant region variants with extended half-life provides a modular approach to improving the pharmacokinetic properties of antibodies, as described herein. In addition, due to the methodologies outlined herein, the possibility of immunogenicity resulting from the FcRn variants is significantly reduced by importing variants from different IgG isotypes such that serum half-life is increased without introducing significant immunogenicity.","In one aspect, the present invention provides an antibody comprising a variant Fc region as compared to a parent Fc region, wherein the variant Fc region comprises a first mutation which is a serine at position 434 and a second mutation selected from the group: an isoleucine at position 311, a valine at position 311, an isoleucine at position 436, and a valine at position 436. In a further aspect, the antibody has increased serum half-life as compared to an antibody comprising the parent Fc region, wherein numbering is according to the EU index. In a still further aspect, the antibody has increased binding affinity to a human FcRn receptor as compared to an antibody comprising the parent Fc region, wherein numbering is according to the EU index.","In one embodiment, the present invention provides nucleic acids encoding any of the variant Fc regions described herein.","In a further embodiment, the present invention provides host cells comprising a nucleic acid encoding any of the variant Fc regions described herein.","In one aspect, the present invention provides methods of administering an antibody to a subject, where the antibody comprises a variant Fc region as compared to a parent Fc region, wherein the variant Fc region comprises a first mutation which is a serine at position 434 and a second mutation selected from the group: an isoleucine at position 311, a valine at position 311, an isoleucine at position 436, and a valine at position 436, where the antibody has increased serum half-life as compared to an antibody comprising the parent Fc region, and wherein numbering is according to the EU index.","The present invention discloses the generation of novel variants of Fc domains, including those found in antibodies, Fc fusions, and immuno-adhesions, which have an increased binding to the FcRn receptor. As noted herein, binding to FcRn results in longer serum retention in vivo. These variants of Fc domains are also referred to herein as \u201cFc variants\u201d or \u201cFcRn variants\u201d.","The substitutions in the Fc domains (\u201cFc substitutions\u201d) are chosen such that the resultant proteins (\u201cFc proteins\u201d) show improved serum half-life in vivo as compared to the wild type protein. In order to increase the retention of the Fc proteins in vivo, the increase in binding affinity must be at around pH 6 while maintaining lower affinity at around pH 7.4. Although still under examination, Fc regions are believed to have longer half-lives in vivo, because binding to FcRn at pH 6 in an endosome sequesters the Fc (Ghetie and Ward, 1997 Immunol Today. 18(12): 592-598, entirely incorporated by reference). The endosomal compartment then recycles the Fc to the cell surface. Once the compartment opens to the extracellular space, the higher pH, \u02dc7.4, induces the release of Fc back into the blood. In mice, Dall' Acqua et al. showed that Fc mutants with increased FcRn binding at pH 6 and pH 7.4 actually had reduced serum concentrations and the same half life as wild-type Fc (Dall' Acqua et al. 2002, J. Immunol. 169:5171-5180, entirely incorporated by reference). The increased affinity of Fc for FcRn at pH 7.4 is thought to forbid the release of the Fc back into the blood. Therefore, the Fc mutations that will increase Fc's half-life in vivo will ideally increase FcRn binding at the lower pH while still allowing release of Fc at higher pH. The amino acid histidine changes its charge state in the pH range of 6.0 to 7.4. Therefore, it is not surprising to find H is residues at important positions in the Fc\/FcRn complex.","An additional aspect of the invention is the increase in FcRn binding over wild type specifically at lower pH, about pH 6.0, to facilitate Fc\/FcRn binding in the endosome. Also disclosed are Fc variants with altered FcRn binding and altered binding to another class of Fc receptors, the Fc\u03b3R's (sometimes written FcgammaR's) as differential binding to Fc\u03b3R5, particularly increased binding to Fc\u03b3RIIIb and decreased binding to Fc\u03b3RIIb, has been shown to result in increased efficacy.","In addition, many embodiments of the invention rely on the \u201cimportation\u201d of substitutions at particular positions from one IgG isotype into another, thus reducing or eliminating the possibility of unwanted immunogenicity being introduced into the variants. That is, IgG1 is a common isotype for therapeutic antibodies for a variety of reasons, including high effector function. IgG2 residues at particular positions can be introduced into the IgG1 backbone to result in a protein that exhibits longer serum half-life.","In other embodiments, non-isotypic amino acid changes are made, to improve binding to FcRn and\/or to increase in vivo serum half-life, and\/or to allow accommodations in structure for stability, etc. as is more further described below.","As will be appreciated by those in the art and described below, a number of factors contribute to the in vivo clearance, and thus the half-life, of antibodies in serum. One factor involves the antigen to which the antibody binds; that is, antibodies with identical constant regions but different variable regions (e.g. Fv domains), may have different half-lives due to differential ligand binding effects. However, the present invention demonstrates that while the absolute half life of two different antibodies may differ due to these antigen specificity effects, the FcRn variants described herein, can transfer to different ligands to give the same trends of increasing half-life. That is, in general, the relative \u201corder\u201d of the FcRn binding\/half life increases will track to antibodies with the same variants of antibodies with different Fvs as is discussed herein.","The present invention relates to the generation of Fc variants of antibodies, generally therapeutic antibodies. As is discussed below, the term \u201cantibody\u201d is used generally. Antibodies that find use in the present invention can take on a number of formats as described herein, including traditional antibodies as well as antibody derivatives, fragments and mimetics, described below. In general, the term \u201cantibody\u201d includes any polypeptide that includes at least one constant domain, including, but not limited to, CH1, CH2, CH3 and CL.","Traditional antibody structural units typically comprise a tetramer. Each tetramer is typically composed of two identical pairs of polypeptide chains, each pair having one \u201clight\u201d (typically having a molecular weight of about 25 kDa) and one \u201cheavy\u201d chain (typically having a molecular weight of about 50-70 kDa). Human light chains are classified as kappa and lambda light chains. The present invention is directed to the IgG class, which has several subclasses, including, but not limited to IgG1, IgG2, IgG3, and IgG4. Thus, \u201cisotype\u201d as used herein is meant any of the subclasses of immunoglobulins defined by the chemical and antigenic characteristics of their constant regions. It should be understood that therapeutic antibodies can also comprise hybrids of isotypes and\/or subclasses. For example, as shown herein, the present invention covers Fc variant engineering of IgG1\/G2 hybrids.","The amino-terminal portion of each chain includes a variable region of about 100 to 110 or more amino acids primarily responsible for antigen recognition, generally referred to in the art and herein as the \u201cFv domain\u201d or \u201cFv region\u201d. In the variable region, three loops are gathered for each of the V domains of the heavy chain and light chain to form an antigen-binding site. Each of the loops is referred to as a complementarity-determining region (hereinafter referred to as a \u201cCDR\u201d), in which the variation in the amino acid sequence is most significant. \u201cVariable\u201d refers to the fact that certain segments of the variable region differ extensively in sequence among antibodies. Variability within the variable region is not evenly distributed. Instead, the V regions consist of relatively invariant stretches called framework regions (FRs) of 15-30 amino acids separated by shorter regions of extreme variability called \u201chypervariable regions\u201d that are each 9-15 amino acids long or longer.","Each VH and VL is composed of three hypervariable regions (\u201ccomplementary determining regions,\u201d \u201cCDRs\u201d) and four FRs, arranged from amino-terminus to carboxy-terminus in the following order: FR1-CDR1-FR2-CDR2-FR3-CDR3-FR4.","The hypervariable region generally encompasses amino acid residues from about amino acid residues 24-34 (LCDR1; \u201cL\u201d denotes light chain), 50-56 (LCDR2) and 89-97 (LCDR3) in the light chain variable region and around about 31-35B (HCDR1; \u201cH\u201d denotes heavy chain), 50-65 (HCDR2), and 95-102 (HCDR3) in the heavy chain variable region; Kabat et al., SEQUENCES OF PROTEINS OF IMMUNOLOGICAL INTEREST, 5Ed. Public Health Service, National Institutes of Health, Bethesda, Md. (1991) and\/or those residues forming a hypervariable loop (e.g. residues 26-32 (LCDR1), 50-52 (LCDR2) and 91-96 (LCDR3) in the light chain variable region and 26-32 (HCDR1), 53-55 (HCDR2) and 96-101 (HCDR3) in the heavy chain variable region; Chothia and Lesk (1987) J. Mol. Biol. 196:901-917. Specific CDRs of the invention are described below.","Throughout the present specification, the Kabat numbering system is generally used when referring to a residue in the variable domain (approximately, residues 1-107 of the light chain variable region and residues 1-113 of the heavy chain variable region) (e.g, Kabat et al., supra (1991)).","The CDRs contribute to the formation of the antigen-binding, or more specifically, epitope binding site of antibodies. \u201cEpitope\u201d refers to a determinant that interacts with a specific antigen binding site in the variable region of an antibody molecule known as a paratope. Epitopes are groupings of molecules such as amino acids or sugar side chains and usually have specific structural characteristics, as well as specific charge characteristics. A single antigen may have more than one epitope.","The epitope may comprise amino acid residues directly involved in the binding (also called immunodominant component of the epitope) and other amino acid residues, which are not directly involved in the binding, such as amino acid residues which are effectively blocked by the specifically antigen binding peptide; in other words, the amino acid residue is within the footprint of the specifically antigen binding peptide.","Epitopes may be either conformational or linear. A conformational epitope is produced by spatially juxtaposed amino acids from different segments of the linear polypeptide chain. A linear epitope is one produced by adjacent amino acid residues in a polypeptide chain. Conformational and nonconformational epitopes may be distinguished in that the binding to the former but not the latter is lost in the presence of denaturing solvents.","An epitope typically includes at least 3, and more usually, at least 5 or 8-10 amino acids in a unique spatial conformation. Antibodies that recognize the same epitope can be verified in a simple immunoassay showing the ability of one antibody to block the binding of another antibody to a target antigen, for example \u201cbinning.\u201d","As will be appreciated by those in the art, a wide variant of antigen binding domains, e.g. Fv regions, may find use in the present invention. Virtually any antigen may be targeted by the IgG variants, including but not limited to proteins, subunits, domains, motifs, and\/or epitopes belonging to the following list of target antigens, which includes both soluble factors such as cytokines and membrane-bound factors, including transmembrane receptors: 17-IA, 4-1BB, 4Dc, 6-keto-PGF1a, 8-iso-PGF2a, 8-oxo-dG, A1 Adenosine Receptor, A33, ACE,

defines a constant region primarily responsible for effector function. Kabat et al. collected numerous primary sequences of the variable regions of heavy chains and light chains. Based on the degree of conservation of the sequences, they classified individual primary sequences into the CDR and the framework and made a list thereof (see SEQUENCES OF IMMUNOLOGICAL INTEREST, 5edition, NIH publication, No. 91-3242, E. A. Kabat et al., entirely incorporated by reference).","In the IgG subclass of immunoglobulins, there are several immunoglobulin domains in the heavy chain. By \u201cimmunoglobulin (Ig) domain\u201d herein is meant a region of an immunoglobulin having a distinct tertiary structure. Of interest in the present invention are the heavy chain domains, including, the constant heavy (CH) domains and the hinge domains. In the context of IgG antibodies, the IgG isotypes each have three CH regions. Accordingly, \u201cCH\u201d domains in the context of IgG are as follows: \u201cCH1\u201d refers to positions 118-220 according to the EU index as in Kabat. \u201cCH2\u201d refers to positions 237-340 according to the EU index as in Kabat, and \u201cCH3\u201d refers to positions 341-447 according to the EU index as in Kabat. As shown herein and described below, the variants of the present invention can include substitutions in one or more of the CH regions, as well as the hinge region, discussed below.","It should be noted that the sequences depicted herein start at the CH1 region, position 118; the variable regions are not included except as noted. For example, the first amino acid of SEQ ID NO: 2, while designated as position\u201c1\u201d in the sequence listing, corresponds to position 118 of the CH1 region, according to EU numbering.","Another type of Ig domain of the heavy chain is the hinge region. By \u201chinge\u201d or \u201chinge region\u201d or \u201cantibody hinge region\u201d or \u201cimmunoglobulin hinge region\u201d herein is meant the flexible polypeptide comprising the amino acids between the first and second constant domains of an antibody. Structurally, the IgG CH1 domain ends at EU position 220, and the IgG CH2 domain begins at residue EU position 237. Thus for IgG the antibody hinge is herein defined to include positions 221 (D221 in IgG1) to 236 (G236 in IgG1), wherein the numbering is according to the EU index as in Kabat. In some embodiments, for example in the context of an Fc region, the lower hinge is included, with the \u201clower hinge\u201d generally referring to positions 226 or 230. As noted herein, Fc variant variants can be made in the hinge region as well.","The light chain generally comprises two domains, the variable light domain (containing the light chain CDRs and together with the variable heavy domains forming the Fv region), and a constant light chain region (often referred to as CL or C\u03ba.","Another region of interest for additional substitutions, outlined below, is the Fc region. By \u201cFc\u201d or \u201cFc region\u201d or \u201cFc domain\u201d as used herein is meant the polypeptide comprising the constant region of an antibody excluding the first constant region immunoglobulin domain and in some cases, part of the hinge. Thus Fc refers to the last two constant region immunoglobulin domains of IgA, IgD, and IgG, the last three constant region immunoglobulin domains of IgE and IgM, and the flexible hinge N-terminal to these domains. For IgA and IgM, Fc may include the J chain. For IgG, the Fc domain comprises immunoglobulin domains C\u03b32 and C\u03b33 (C\u03b32 and C\u03b33) and the lower hinge region between C\u03b31 (C\u03b31) and Cy2 (Cy2). Although the boundaries of the Fc region may vary, the human IgG heavy chain Fc region is usually defined to include residues C226 or P230 to its carboxyl-terminus, wherein the numbering is according to the EU index as in Kabat. In some embodiments, as is more fully described below, amino acid modifications are made to the Fc region, for example to alter binding to one or more Fc\u03b3R receptors or to the FcRn receptor.","In some embodiments, the antibodies are full length. By \u201cfull length antibody\u201d herein is meant the structure that constitutes the natural biological form of an antibody, including variable and constant regions, including one or more modifications as outlined herein.","Alternatively, the antibodies can be a variety of structures, including, but not limited to, antibody fragments, monoclonal antibodies, bispecific antibodies, minibodies, domain antibodies, synthetic antibodies (sometimes referred to herein as \u201cantibody mimetics\u201d), chimeric antibodies, humanized antibodies, antibody fusions (sometimes referred to as \u201cantibody conjugates\u201d), and fragments of each, respectively.","In one embodiment, the antibody is an antibody fragment, as long as it contains at least one constant domain which can be engineered. Specific antibody fragments include, but are not limited to, (i) the Fab fragment consisting of VL, VH, CL and CH1 domains, (ii) the Fd fragment consisting of the VH and CH1 domains, (iii) F(ab\u2032)2 fragments, a bivalent fragment comprising two linked Fab fragments (vii) single chain Fv molecules (scFv), wherein a VH domain and a VL domain are linked by a peptide linker which allows the two domains to associate to form an antigen binding site (Bird et al., 1988, Science 242:423-426, Huston et al., 1988, Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U.S.A. 85:5879-5883, entirely incorporated by reference), (iv) \u201cdiabodies\u201d or \u201ctriabodies\u201d, multivalent or multispecific fragments constructed by gene fusion (Tomlinson et. al., 2000, Methods Enzymol. 326:461-479; WO94\/13804; Holliger et al., 1993, Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U.S.A. 90:6444-6448, all entirely incorporated by reference).","Other antibody fragments that can be used include fragments that contain one or more of the CH1, CH2, CH3, hinge and CL domains of the invention that have been engineered. For example, Fc fusions are fusions of the Fc region (CH2 and CH3, optionally with the hinge region) fused to another protein. A number of Fc fusions are known the art and can be improved by the addition of the variants of the invention. In the present case, antibody fusions can be made comprising CH1; CH1, CH2 and CH3; CH2; CH3; CH2 and CH3; CH1 and CH3, any or all of which can be made optionally with the hinge region, utilizing any combination of Fc variants described herein.","In some embodiments, the antibody can be a mixture from different species, e.g. a chimeric antibody and\/or a humanized antibody. In general, both \u201cchimeric antibodies\u201d and \u201chumanized antibodies\u201d refer to antibodies that combine regions from more than one species. For example, \u201cchimeric antibodies\u201d traditionally comprise variable region(s) from a mouse (or rat, in some cases) and the constant region(s) from a human. \u201cHumanized antibodies\u201d generally refer to non-human antibodies that have had the variable-domain framework regions swapped for sequences found in human antibodies. Generally, in a humanized antibody, the entire antibody, except the CDRs, is encoded by a polynucleotide of human origin or is identical to such an antibody except within its CDRs. The CDRs, some or all of which are encoded by nucleic acids originating in a non-human organism, are grafted into the beta-sheet framework of a human antibody variable region to create an antibody, the specificity of which is determined by the engrafted CDRs. The creation of such antibodies is described in, e.g., WO 92\/11018, Jones, 1986, Nature 321:522-525, Verhoeyen et al., 1988, Science 239:1534-1536, all entirely incorporated by reference. \u201cBackmutation\u201d of selected acceptor framework residues to the corresponding donor residues is often required to regain affinity that is lost in the initial grafted construct (U.S. Pat. No. 5,530,101; U.S. Pat. No. 5,585,089; U.S. Pat. No. 5,693,761; U.S. Pat. No. 5,693,762; U.S. Pat. No. 6,180,370; U.S. Pat. No. 5,859,205; U.S. Pat. No. 5,821,337; U.S. Pat. No. 6,054,297; U.S. Pat. No. 6,407,213, all entirely incorporated by reference). The humanized antibody optimally also will comprise at least a portion of an immunoglobulin constant region, typically that of a human immunoglobulin, and thus will typically comprise a human Fc region. Humanized antibodies can also be generated using mice with a genetically engineered immune system. Roque et al., 2004, Biotechnol. Prog. 20:639-654, entirely incorporated by reference. A variety of techniques and methods for humanizing and reshaping non-human antibodies are well known in the art (See Tsurushita & Vasquez, 2004, Humanization of Monoclonal Antibodies, Molecular Biology of B Cells, 533-545, Elsevier Science (USA), and references cited therein, all entirely incorporated by reference). Humanization methods include but are not limited to methods described in Jones et al., 1986, Nature 321:522-525; Riechmann et al., 1988; Nature 332:323-329; Verhoeyen et al., 1988, Science, 239:1534-1536; Queen et al., 1989, Proc Natl Acad Sci, USA 86:10029-33; He et al., 1998, J.

Structure-based methods may be employed for humanization and affinity maturation, for example as described in U.S. Ser. No. 11\/004,590. Selection based methods may be employed to humanize and\/or affinity mature antibody variable regions, including but not limited to methods described in Wu et al., 1999, J. Mol.

These are antibodies that bind to two (or more) different antigens, or different epitopes on the same antigen. Diabodies can be manufactured in a variety of ways known in the art (Holliger and Winter, 1993, Current Opinion Biotechnol. 4:446-449, entirely incorporated by reference), e.g., prepared chemically or from hybrid hybridomas. In some cases, multispecific (for example bispecific) antibodies are not preferred.","In one embodiment, the antibody is a minibody. Minibodies are minimized antibody-like proteins comprising a scFv joined to a CH3 domain. Hu et al., 1996, Cancer Res. 56:3055-3061, entirely incorporated by reference. In the present instance, the CH3 domain can be engineered to improve binding to FcRn and\/or increase in vivo serum half-life. In some cases, the scFv can be joined to the Fc region, and may include some or the entire hinge region.","The antibodies of the present invention are generally isolated or recombinant. \u201cIsolated,\u201d when used to describe the various polypeptides disclosed herein, means a polypeptide that has been identified and separated and\/or recovered from a cell or cell culture from which it was expressed. Ordinarily, an isolated polypeptide will be prepared by at least one purification step. An \u201cisolated antibody,\u201d refers to an antibody which is substantially free of other antibodies having different antigenic specificities.","\u201cSpecific binding\u201d or \u201cspecifically binds to\u201d or is \u201cspecific for\u201d a particular antigen or an epitope means binding that is measurably different from a non-specific interaction. Specific binding can be measured, for example, by determining binding of a molecule compared to binding of a control molecule, which generally is a molecule of similar structure that does not have binding activity. For example, specific binding can be determined by competition with a control molecule that is similar to the target.","Specific binding for a particular antigen or an epitope can be exhibited, for example, by an antibody having a KD for an antigen or epitope of at least about 10M, at least about 10M, at least about 10M, at least about 10M, at least about 10M, at least about 10M, alternatively at least about 10M, at least about 10M, at least about 10M, or greater, where KD refers to a dissociation rate of a particular antibody-antigen interaction. Typically, an antibody that specifically binds an antigen will have a KD that is 20-, 50-, 100-, 500-, 1000-, 5,000-, 10,000- or more times greater for a control molecule relative to the antigen or epitope.","Also, specific binding for a particular antigen or an epitope can be exhibited, for example, by an antibody having a KA or Ka for an antigen or epitope of at least 20-, 50-, 100-, 500-, 1000-, 5,000-, 10,000- or more times greater for the epitope relative to a control, where KA or Ka refers to an association rate of a particular antibody-antigen interaction.","The present invention relates to the generation of Fc variants of antibodies. As discussed above, by \u201cFc\u201d or \u201cFc region\u201d or \u201cFc domain\u201d as used herein is meant the polypeptide comprising the constant region of an antibody excluding the first constant region immunoglobulin domain and in some cases, part of the hinge. Thus Fc refers to the last two constant region immunoglobulin domains of IgA, IgD, and IgG, the last three constant region immunoglobulin domains of IgE and IgM, and the flexible hinge N-terminal to these domains. For IgA and IgM, Fc may include the J chain. For IgG, the Fc domain comprises immunoglobulin domains C\u03b32 and C\u03b33 (C\u03b32 and C\u03b33) and the lower hinge region between C\u03b31 (C\u03b31) and C\u03b32 (C\u03b32). Although the boundaries of the Fc region may vary, the human IgG heavy chain Fc region is usually defined to include residues C226 or P230 to its carboxyl-terminus, wherein the numbering is according to the EU index as in Kabat. In some embodiments, as is more fully described below, amino acid modifications are made to the Fc region, for example to alter binding to one or more Fc\u03b3R receptors or to the FcRn receptor.","The present invention relates to the generation of Fc variants of antibodies to form \u201cFc variant antibodies\u201d. Fc variants are made by introducing amino acid mutations into the parent molecule. \u201cMutations\u201d in this context are usually amino acid substitutions, although as shown herein, deletions and insertions of amino acids can also be done and thus are defined as mutations.","The Fc variant antibodies of the invention show increased binding to FcRn and\/or increased in vivo serum half-life. By \u201cFcRn\u201d or \u201cneonatal Fc Receptor\u201d as used herein is meant a protein that binds the IgG antibody Fc region and is encoded at least in part by an FcRn gene. The FcRn may be from any organism, including but not limited to humans, mice, rats, rabbits, and monkeys. As is known in the art, the functional FcRn protein comprises two polypeptides, often referred to as the heavy chain and light chain. The light chain is beta-2-microglobulin and the heavy chain is encoded by the FcRn gene. Unless other wise noted herein, FcRn or an FcRn protein refers to the complex of FcRn heavy chain with beta-2-microglobulin. In some cases, the FcRn variants bind to the human FcRn receptor, or it may be desirable to design variants that bind to rodent or primate receptors in addition, to facilitate clinical trials.","A variety of such substitutions are known and described in U.S. Ser.

This is to be distinguished from affinity maturation substitutions in the variable region(s) that are made to increase binding affinity of the antibody to its antigen. That is, an Fc variant in the variable region(s) is generally significantly \u201csilent\u201d with respect to binding affinity.","As will be appreciated by those in the art, the Fc variant antibodies of the invention can contain additional amino acid substitutions in addition to the substitutions discussed above.","In some embodiments, amino acid substitutions are imported from one isotype into the Fc variant antibody.","In the hinge region (positions 233-236), changes can be made to increase effector function. That is, IgG2 has lowered effector function, and as a result, amino acid substitutions at these positions from PVA(deletion) can be changed to ELLG, and an additional G327A variant generated as well.","In the CH3 region, a mutation at position 384 can be made, for example substituting a non-native serine.","Additional mutations that can be made include adding either N-terminal or C-terminal (depending on the structure of the antibody or fusion protein) \u201ctails\u201d or sequences of one or more Fc amino acids; for example, glutamic acids and aspartic acids can be added to the CH3 C-terminus; generally, from 1 to 5 amino acids are added.","Properties of the Fc Variant Antibodies of the Invention","The Fc variant antibodies of the invention display increased binding to FcRn and\/or increased in vivo serum half-life.","In addition, some variants herein are generated to increase stability. As noted herein, a number of properties of antibodies affect the clearance rate (e.g. stability for half-life) in vivo. In addition to antibody binding to the FcRn receptor, other factors that contribute to clearance and half-life are serum aggregation, enzymatic degradation in the serum, inherent immunogenicity of the antibody leading to clearing by the immune system, antigen-mediated uptake, FcR (non-FcRn) mediated uptake and non-serum distribution (e.g. in different tissue compartments).","Fc Engineering","In addition to substitutions made to increase binding affinity to FcRn and\/or increase serum half life, other substitutions can be made in the Fc region, in general for altering binding to Fc\u03b3R receptors.","By \u201cFc gamma receptor\u201d, \u201cFc\u03b3R\u201d or \u201cFcgammaR\u201d as used herein is meant any member of the family of proteins that bind the IgG antibody Fc region and is encoded by an Fc\u03b3R gene. In humans this family includes but is not limited to Fc\u03b3RI (CD64), including isoforms Fc\u03b3RIa, Fc\u03b3RIb, and Fc\u03b3RIc; Fc\u03b3RII (CD32), including isoforms Fc\u03b3RIIa (including allotypes H131 and R131), Fc\u03b3RIIb (including Fc\u03b3RIIb-1 and Fc\u03b3RIIb-2), and Fc\u03b3RIIc; and Fc\u03b3RIII (CD16), including isoforms Fc\u03b3RIIIa (including allotypes V158 and F158) and Fc\u03b3RIIIb (including allotypes Fc\u03b3RIIIb-NA1 and Fc\u03b3RIIIb-NA2) (Jefferis et al., 200282:57-65, entirely incorporated by reference), as well as any undiscovered human Fc\u03b3Rs or Fc\u03b3R isoforms or allotypes. An Fc\u03b3R may be from any organism, including but not limited to humans, mice, rats, rabbits, and monkeys. Mouse Fc\u03b3Rs include but are not limited to Fc\u03b3RI (CD64), Fc\u03b3RII (CD32), Fc\u03b3RIII-1 (CD16), and Fc\u03b3RIII-2 (CD16-2), as well as any undiscovered mouse Fc\u03b3Rs or Fc\u03b3R isoforms or allotypes.","There are a number of useful Fc substitutions that can be made to alter binding to one or more of the Fc\u03b3R receptors. Substitutions that result in increased binding as well as decreased binding can be useful. For example, it is known that increased binding to Fc\u03b3RIIIa generally results in increased ADCC (antibody dependent cell-mediated cytotoxicity; the cell-mediated reaction wherein nonspecific cytotoxic cells that express Fc\u03b3Rs recognize bound antibody on a target cell and subsequently cause lysis of the target cell. Similarly, decreased binding to Fc\u03b3RIIb (an inhibitory receptor) can be beneficial as well in some circumstances. Amino acid substitutions that find use in the present invention include those listed in U.S. Ser. Nos. 11\/124,620 (particularly FIG. 41), 11\/174,287, 11\/396,495, 11\/538,406, all of which are expressly incorporated herein by reference in their entirety and specifically for the variants disclosed therein. Particular variants that find use include, but are not limited to, 236A, 239D, 239E, 332E, 332D, 239D\/332E, 267D, 267E, 328F, 267E\/328F, 236A\/332E, 239D\/332E\/330Y, 239D, 332E\/330L and 299T.","In addition to substitutions made to increase binding affinity to FcRn and\/or increase in vivo serum half life, additional antibody modifications can be made, as described in further detail below.","Affinity Maturation","In some embodiments, one or more amino acid modifications are made in one or more of the CDRs of the antibody. In general, only 1 or 2 or 3-amino acids are substituted in any single CDR, and generally no more than from 4, 5, 6, 7, 8 9 or 10 changes are made within a set of CDRs. However, it should be appreciated that any combination of no substitutions, 1, 2 or 3 substitutions in any CDR can be independently and optionally combined with any other substitution.","In some cases, amino acid modifications in the CDRs are referred to as \u201caffinity maturation\u201d. An \u201caffinity matured\u201d antibody is one having one or more alteration(s) in one or more CDRs which results in an improvement in the affinity of the antibody for antigen, compared to a parent antibody which does not possess those alteration(s). In some cases, although rare, it may be desirable to decrease the affinity of an antibody to its antigen, but this is generally not preferred.","Affinity maturation can be done to increase the binding affinity of the antibody for the antigen by at least about 10% to 50-100-150% or more, or from 1 to 5 fold as compared to the \u201cparent\u201d antibody. Preferred affinity matured antibodies will have nanomolar or even picomolar affinities for the target antigen. Affinity matured antibodies are produced by known procedures. See, for example, Marks et al., 1992, Biotechnology 10:779-783 that describes affinity maturation by variable heavy chain (VH) and variable light chain (VL) domain shuffling. Random mutagenesis of CDR and\/or framework residues is described in: Barbas, et al. 1994, Proc. Nat. Acad. Sci, USA 91:3809-3813; Shier et al., 1995, Gene 169:147-155; Yelton et al., 1995, J. Immunol. 155:1994-2004; Jackson et al., 1995, J. Immunol. 154(7):3310-9; and Hawkins et al, 1992, J. Mol. Biol. 226:889-896, for example.","Alternatively, amino acid modifications can be made in one or more of the CDRs of the antibodies of the invention that are \u201csilent\u201d, e.g. that do not significantly alter the affinity of the antibody for the antigen. These can be made for a number of reasons, including optimizing expression (as can be done for the nucleic acids encoding the antibodies of the invention).","Thus, included within the definition of the CDRs and antibodies of the invention are variant CDRs and antibodies; that is, the antibodies of the invention can include amino acid modifications in one or more of the CDRs of Ab79 and Ab19. In addition, as outlined below, amino acid modifications can also independently and optionally be made in any region outside the CDRs, including framework and constant regions.","ADC Modifications","In some embodiments, the Fc variant antibodies of the invention are conjugated with drugs to form antibody-drug conjugates (ADCs). In general, ADCs are used in oncology applications, where the use of antibody-drug conjugates for the local delivery of cytotoxic or cytostatic agents allows for the targeted delivery of the drug moiety to tumors, which can allow higher efficacy, lower toxicity, etc. An overview of this technology is provided in Ducry et al., Bioconjugate Chem., 21:5-13 (2010), Carter et al., Cancer J. 14(3):154 (2008) and Senter, Current Opin.

Generally, conjugation is done by covalent attachment to the antibody, as further described below, and generally relies on a linker, often a peptide linkage (which, as described below, may be designed to be sensitive to cleavage by proteases at the target site or not). In addition, as described above, linkage of the linker-drug unit (LU-D) can be done by attachment to cysteines within the antibody. As will be appreciated by those in the art, the number of drug moieties per antibody can change, depending on the conditions of the reaction, and can vary from 1:1 to 10:1 drug:antibody. As will be appreciated by those in the art, the actual number is an average.","Thus the invention provides Fc variant antibodies conjugated to drugs.

The cytotoxicity of the TA.1-maytansonoid conjugate was tested in vitro on the human breast cancer cell line SK-BR-3, which expresses 3\u00d7105 HER-2 surface antigens per cell. The drug conjugate achieved a degree of cytotoxicity similar to the free maytansinoid drug, which could be increased by increasing the number of maytansinoid molecules per antibody molecule.

For example, Mylotarg is the first commercial ADC drug and utilizes calicheamicin \u03b31 as the payload (see U.S. Pat. No. 4,970,198, incorporated by reference in its entirety). Additional calicheamicin derivatives are described in U.S. Pat. Nos. 5,264,586, 5,384,412, 5,550,246, 5,739,116, 5,773,001, 5,767,285 and 5,877,296, all expressly incorporated by reference. The calicheamicin family of antibiotics are capable of producing double-stranded DNA breaks at sub-picomolar concentrations.

Structural analogues of calicheamicin which may be used include, but are not limited to, \u03b31I, a2I, a2I, N-acetyl-\u03b31I, PSAG and \u03b8I1 (Hinman et al., Cancer Research 53:3336-3342 (1993), Lode et al., Cancer Research 58:2925-2928 (1998) and the aforementioned U.S. patents to American Cyanamid). Another anti-tumor drug that the antibody can be conjugated is QFA which is an antifolate. Both calicheamicin and QFA have intracellular sites of action and do not readily cross the plasma membrane. Therefore, cellular uptake of these agents through antibody mediated internalization greatly enhances their cytotoxic effects.","Duocarmycins","CC-1065 (see U.S. Pat. No. 4,169,888, incorporated by reference) and duocarmycins are members of a family of antitumor antibiotics utilized in ADCs. These antibiotics appear to work through sequence-selectively alkylating DNA at the N3 of adenine in the minor groove, which initiates a cascade of events that result in apoptosis.","Important members of the duocarmycins include duocarmycin A (U.S. Pat.

A variety of radioactive isotopes are available for the production of radioconjugated antibodies. Examples include At211, I131, I125, Y90, Re186, Re188, Sm153, Bi212, P32, Pb212 and radioactive isotopes of Lu.","The radio- or other labels may be incorporated in the conjugate in known ways. For example, the peptide may be biosynthesized or may be synthesized by chemical amino acid synthesis using suitable amino acid precursors involving, for example, fluorine-19 in place of hydrogen. Labels such as Tc99m or 1123, Re186, Re188 and In111 can be attached via a cysteine residue in the peptide. Yttrium-90 can be attached via a lysine residue. The IODOGEN method (Fraker et al (1978) Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun 80: 49-57 can be used to incorporate Iodine-123. \u201cMonoclonal Antibodies in Immunoscintigraphy\u201d (Chatal, CRC Press 1989) describes other methods in detail.","For compositions comprising a plurality of antibodies, the drug loading is represented by p, the average number of drug molecules per Antibody. Drug loading may range from 1 to 20 drugs (D) per Antibody. The average number of drugs per antibody in preparation of conjugation reactions may be characterized by conventional means such as mass spectroscopy, ELISA assay, and HPLC. The quantitative distribution of Antibody-Drug-Conjugates in terms of p may also be determined.","In some instances, separation, purification, and characterization of homogeneous Antibody-Drug-conjugates where p is a certain value from Antibody-Drug-Conjugates with other drug loadings may be achieved by means such as reverse phase HPLC or electrophoresis. In exemplary embodiments, p is 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, or 8 or a fraction thereof.","The generation of Antibody-drug conjugate compounds can be accomplished by any technique known to the skilled artisan. Briefly, the Antibody-drug conjugate compounds can include an Fc variant antibody as the Antibody unit, a drug, and optionally a linker that joins the drug and the binding agent.","A number of different reactions are available for covalent attachment of drugs and\/or linkers to binding agents. This is can be accomplished by reaction of the amino acid residues of the binding agent, for example, antibody molecule, including the amine groups of lysine, the free carboxylic acid groups of glutamic and aspartic acid, the sulfhydryl groups of cysteine and the various moieties of the aromatic amino acids. A commonly used non-specific methods of covalent attachment is the carbodiimide reaction to link a carboxy (or amino) group of a compound to amino (or carboxy) groups of the antibody. Additionally, bifunctional agents such as dialdehydes or imidoesters have been used to link the amino group of a compound to amino groups of an antibody molecule.","Also available for attachment of drugs to binding agents is the Schiff base reaction. This method involves the periodate oxidation of a drug that contains glycol or hydroxy groups, thus forming an aldehyde which is then reacted with the binding agent. Attachment occurs via formation of a Schiff base with amino groups of the binding agent. Isothiocyanates can also be used as coupling agents for covalently attaching drugs to binding agents. Other techniques are known to the skilled artisan and within the scope of the present invention.","In some embodiments, an intermediate, which is the precursor of the linker, is reacted with the drug under appropriate conditions. In other embodiments, reactive groups are used on the drug and\/or the intermediate. The product of the reaction between the drug and the intermediate, or the derivatized drug, is subsequently reacted with an Fc variant antibody of the invention under appropriate conditions.","It will be understood that chemical modifications may also be made to the desired compound in order to make reactions of that compound more convenient for purposes of preparing conjugates of the invention. For example a functional group e g amine, hydroxyl, or sulfhydryl, may be appended to the drug at a position which has minimal or an acceptable effect on the activity or other properties of the drug","Typically, the antibody-drug conjugate compounds comprise a Linker unit between the drug unit and the antibody unit. In some embodiments, the linker is cleavable under intracellular or extracellular conditions, such that cleavage of the linker releases the drug unit from the antibody in the appropriate environment. For example, solid tumors that secrete certain proteases may serve as the target of the cleavable linker; in other embodiments, it is the intracellular proteases that are utilized. In yet other embodiments, the linker unit is not cleavable and the drug is released, for example, by antibody degradation in lysosomes.","In some embodiments, the linker is cleavable by a cleaving agent that is present in the intracellular environment (for example, within a lysosome or endosome or caveolea). The linker can be, for example, a peptidyl linker that is cleaved by an intracellular peptidase or protease enzyme, including, but not limited to, a lysosomal or endosomal protease. In some embodiments, the peptidyl linker is at least two amino acids long or at least three amino acids long or more.","Cleaving agents can include, without limitation, cathepsins B and D and plasmin, all of which are known to hydrolyze dipeptide drug derivatives resulting in the release of active drug inside target cells (see, e.g., Dubowchik and Walker, 1999, Pharm. Therapeutics 83:67-123). Peptidyl linkers that are cleavable by enzymes that are present in CD38-expressing cells. For example, a peptidyl linker that is cleavable by the thiol-dependent protease cathepsin-B, which is highly expressed in cancerous tissue, can be used (e.g., a Phe-Leu or a Gly-Phe-Leu-Gly linker (SEQ ID NO: 11). Other examples of such linkers are described, e.g., in U.S. Pat. No. 6,214,345, incorporated herein by reference in its entirety and for all purposes.","In some embodiments, the peptidyl linker cleavable by an intracellular protease is a Val-Cit linker or a Phe-Lys linker (see, e.g., U.S. Pat. No. 6,214,345, which describes the synthesis of doxorubicin with the val-cit linker).","In other embodiments, the cleavable linker is pH-sensitive, that is, sensitive to hydrolysis at certain pH values. Typically, the pH-sensitive linker hydrolyzable under acidic conditions. For example, an acid-labile linker that is hydrolyzable in the lysosome (for example, a hydrazone, semicarbazone, thiosemicarbazone, cis-aconitic amide, orthoester, acetal, ketal, or the like) may be used. (See, e.g., U.S. Pat. Nos. 5,122,368; 5,824,805; 5,622,929; Dubowchik and Walker, 1999, Pharm. Therapeutics 83:67-123; Neville et al., 1989, Biol. Chem. 264:14653-14661.) Such linkers are relatively stable under neutral pH conditions, such as those in the blood, but are unstable at below pH 5.5 or 5.0, the approximate pH of the lysosome. In certain embodiments, the hydrolyzable linker is a thioether linker (such as, e.g., a thioether attached to the therapeutic agent via an acylhydrazone bond (see, e.g., U.S. Pat. No. 5,622,929).","In yet other embodiments, the linker is cleavable under reducing conditions (for example, a disulfide linker). A variety of disulfide linkers are known in the art, including, for example, those that can be formed using SATA (N-succinimidyl-5-acetylthioacetate), SPDP (N-succinimidyl-3-(2-pyridyldithio)propionate), SPDB (N-succinimidyl-3-(2-pyridyldithio)butyrate) and SMPT (N-succinimidyl-oxycarbonyl-alpha-methyl-alpha-(2-pyridyl-dithio)toluene)-, SPDB and SMPT. (See, e.g., Thorpe et al., 1987, Cancer Res. 47:5924-5931; Wawrzynczak et al., In Immunoconjugates: Antibody Conjugates in Radioimagery and Therapy of Cancer (C. W. Vogel ed., Oxford U. Press, 1987. See also U.S. Pat. No. 4,880,935.)","In other embodiments, the linker is a malonate linker (Johnson et al., 1995, Anticancer Res. 15:1387-93), a maleimidobenzoyl linker (Lau et al., 1995, Bioorg-Med-Chem. 3(10):1299-1304), or a 3\u2032-N-amide analog (Lau et al., 1995, Bioorg-Med-Chem. 3(10):1305-12).","In yet other embodiments, the linker unit is not cleavable and the drug is released by antibody degradation. (See U.S. Publication No. 2005\/0238649 incorporated by reference herein in its entirety and for all purposes).","In many embodiments, the linker is self-immolative. As used herein, the term \u201cself-immolative Spacer\u201d refers to a bifunctional chemical moiety that is capable of covalently linking together two spaced chemical moieties into a stable tripartite molecule. It will spontaneously separate from the second chemical moiety if its bond to the first moiety is cleaved. See for example, WO 2007059404A2, WO06110476A2, WO05112919A2, WO2010\/062171, WO09\/017,394, WO07\/089,149, WO 07\/018,431, WO04\/043493 and WO02\/083180, which are directed to drug-cleavable substrate conjugates where the drug and cleavable substrate are optionally linked through a self-immolative linker and which are all expressly incorporated by reference.","Often the linker is not substantially sensitive to the extracellular environment. As used herein, \u201cnot substantially sensitive to the extracellular environment,\u201d in the context of a linker, means that no more than about 20%, 15%, 10%, 5%, 3%, or no more than about 1% of the linkers, in a sample of antibody-drug conjugate compound, are cleaved when the antibody-drug conjugate compound presents in an extracellular environment (for example, in plasma).","Whether a linker is not substantially sensitive to the extracellular environment can be determined, for example, by incubating with plasma the antibody-drug conjugate compound for a predetermined time period (for example, 2, 4, 8, 16, or 24 hours) and then quantitating the amount of free drug present in the plasma.","In other, non-mutually exclusive embodiments, the linker promotes cellular internalization. In certain embodiments, the linker promotes cellular internalization when conjugated to the therapeutic agent (that is, in the milieu of the linker-therapeutic agent moiety of the antibody-drug conjugate compound as described herein). In yet other embodiments, the linker promotes cellular internalization when conjugated to both the auristatin compound and the Fc variant antibodies of the invention.","A variety of exemplary linkers that can be used with the present compositions and methods are described in WO 2004-010957, U.S. Publication No. 2006\/0074008, U.S. Publication No. 20050238649, and U.S. Publication No. 2006\/0024317 (each of which is incorporated by reference herein in its entirety and for all purposes).","Drug loading is represented by p and is the average number of Drug moieties per antibody in a molecule. Drug loading (\u201cp\u201d) may be 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10, 11, 12, 13, 14, 15, 16, 17, 18, 19, 20 or more moieties (D) per antibody, although frequently the average number is a fraction or a decimal. Generally, drug loading of from 1 to 4 is frequently useful, and from 1 to 2 is also useful. ADCs of the invention include collections of antibodies conjugated with a range of drug moieties, from 1 to 20. The average number of drug moieties per antibody in preparations of ADC from conjugation reactions may be characterized by conventional means such as mass spectroscopy and, ELISA assay.","The quantitative distribution of ADC in terms of p may also be determined In some instances, separation, purification, and characterization of homogeneous ADC where p is a certain value from ADC with other drug loadings may be achieved by means such as electrophoresis.","For some antibody-drug conjugates, p may be limited by the number of attachment sites on the antibody. For example, where the attachment is a cysteine thiol, as in the exemplary embodiments above, an antibody may have only one or several cysteine thiol groups, or may have only one or several sufficiently reactive thiol groups through which a linker may be attached. In certain embodiments, higher drug loading, e.g. p>5, may cause aggregation, insolubility, toxicity, or loss of cellular permeability of certain antibody-drug conjugates. In certain embodiments, the drug loading for an ADC of the invention ranges from 1 to about 8; from about 2 to about 6; from about 3 to about 5; from about 3 to about 4; from about 3.1 to about 3.9; from about 3.2 to about 3.8; from about 3.2 to about 3.7; from about 3.2 to about 3.6; from about 3.3 to about 3.8; or from about 3.3 to about 3.7. Indeed, it has been shown that for certain ADCs, the optimal ratio of drug moieties per antibody may be less than 8, and may be about 2 to about 5. See US 2005-0238649 A1 (herein incorporated by reference in its entirety).","In certain embodiments, fewer than the theoretical maximum of drug moieties are conjugated to an antibody during a conjugation reaction. An antibody may contain, for example, lysine residues that do not react with the drug-linker intermediate or linker reagent, as discussed below. Generally, antibodies do not contain many free and reactive cysteine thiol groups which may be linked to a drug moiety; indeed most cysteine thiol residues in antibodies exist as disulfide bridges. In certain embodiments, an antibody may be reduced with a reducing agent such as dithiothreitol (DTT) or tricarbonylethylphosphine (TCEP), under partial or total reducing conditions, to generate reactive cysteine thiol groups. In certain embodiments, an antibody is subjected to denaturing conditions to reveal reactive nucleophilic groups such as lysine or cysteine.","The loading (drug\/antibody ratio) of an ADC may be controlled in different ways, e.g., by: (i) limiting the molar excess of drug-linker intermediate or linker reagent relative to antibody, (ii) limiting the conjugation reaction time or temperature, (iii) partial or limiting reductive conditions for cysteine thiol modification, (iv) engineering by recombinant techniques the amino acid sequence of the antibody such that the number and position of cysteine residues is modified for control of the number and\/or position of linker-drug attachements (such as thioMab or thioFab prepared as disclosed herein and in WO2006\/034488 (herein incorporated by reference in its entirety)).","It is to be understood that where more than one nucleophilic group reacts with a drug-linker intermediate or linker reagent followed by drug moiety reagent, then the resulting product is a mixture of ADC compounds with a distribution of one or more drug moieties attached to an antibody. The average number of drugs per antibody may be calculated from the mixture by a dual ELISA antibody assay, which is specific for antibody and specific for the drug. Individual ADC molecules may be identified in the mixture by mass spectroscopy and separated by HPLC, e.g. hydrophobic interaction chromatography.","In some embodiments, a homogeneous ADC with a single loading value may be isolated from the conjugation mixture by electrophoresis or chromatography.","Methods of Determining Cytotoxic Effect of ADCs","Methods of determining whether a Drug or Antibody-Drug conjugate exerts a cytostatic and\/or cytotoxic effect on a cell are known. Generally, the cytotoxic or cytostatic activity of an Antibody Drug conjugate can be measured by: exposing mammalian cells expressing a target protein of the Antibody Drug conjugate in a cell culture medium; culturing the cells for a period from about 6 hours to about 5 days; and measuring cell viability. Cell-based in vitro assays can be used to measure viability (proliferation), cytotoxicity, and induction of apoptosis (caspase activation) of the Antibody Drug conjugate.","For determining whether an Antibody Drug conjugate exerts a cytostatic effect, a thymidine incorporation assay may be used. For example, cancer cells expressing a target antigen at a density of 5,000 cells\/well of a 96-well plated can be cultured for a 72-hour period and exposed to 0.5 \u03bcCi of H-thymidine during the final 8 hours of the 72-hour period. The incorporation of H-thymidine into cells of the culture is measured in the presence and absence of the Antibody Drug conjugate.","For determining cytotoxicity, necrosis or apoptosis (programmed cell death) can be measured. Necrosis is typically accompanied by increased permeability of the plasma membrane; swelling of the cell, and rupture of the plasma membrane. Apoptosis is typically characterized by membrane blebbing, condensation of cytoplasm, and the activation of endogenous endonucleases. Determination of any of these effects on cancer cells indicates that an Antibody Drug conjugate is useful in the treatment of cancers.","Cell viability can be measured by determining in a cell the uptake of a dye such as neutral red, trypan blue, or ALAMAR\u2122 blue (see, e.g., Page et al., 1993, Intl. J. Oncology 3:473-476). In such an assay, the cells are incubated in media containing the dye, the cells are washed, and the remaining dye, reflecting cellular uptake of the dye, is measured spectrophotometrically. The protein-binding dye sulforhodamine B (SRB) can also be used to measure cytoxicity (Skehan et al., 1990, J. Natl. Cancer Inst. 82:1107-12).","Alternatively, a tetrazolium salt, such as MTT, is used in a quantitative colorimetric assay for mammalian cell survival and proliferation by detecting living, but not dead, cells (see, e.g., Mosmann, 1983, J. Immunol. Methods 65:55-63).","Apoptosis can be quantitated by measuring, for example, DNA fragmentation. Commercial photometric methods for the quantitative in vitro determination of DNA fragmentation are available. Examples of such assays, including TUNEL (which detects incorporation of labeled nucleotides in fragmented DNA) and ELISA-based assays, are described in Biochemica, 1999, no. 2, pp. 34-37 (Roche Molecular Biochemicals).","Apoptosis can also be determined by measuring morphological changes in a cell. For example, as with necrosis, loss of plasma membrane integrity can be determined by measuring uptake of certain dyes (e.g., a fluorescent dye such as, for example, acridine orange or ethidium bromide). A method for measuring apoptotic cell number has been described by Duke and Cohen, Current Protocols in Immunology (Coligan et al. eds., 1992, pp. 3.17.1-3.17.16). Cells also can be labeled with a DNA dye (e.g., acridine orange, ethidium bromide, or propidium iodide) and the cells observed for chromatin condensation and margination along the inner nuclear membrane. Other morphological changes that can be measured to determine apoptosis include, e.g., cytoplasmic condensation, increased membrane blebbing, and cellular shrinkage.","The presence of apoptotic cells can be measured in both the attached and \u201cfloating\u201d compartments of the cultures. For example, both compartments can be collected by removing the supernatant, trypsinizing the attached cells, combining the preparations following a centrifugation wash step (e.g., 10 minutes at 2000 rpm), and detecting apoptosis (e.g., by measuring DNA fragmentation). (See, e.g., Piazza et al., 1995, Cancer Research 55:3110-16).","In vivo, the effect of a therapeutic composition of the Fc variant antibody of the invention can be evaluated in a suitable animal model. For example, xenogenic cancer models can be used, wherein cancer explants or passaged xenograft tissues are introduced into immune compromised animals, such as nude or SCID mice (Klein et al., 1997, Nature Medicine 3: 402-408). Efficacy can be measured using assays that measure inhibition of tumor formation, tumor regression or metastasis, and the like.","The therapeutic compositions used in the practice of the foregoing methods can be formulated into pharmaceutical compositions comprising a carrier suitable for the desired delivery method. Suitable carriers include any material that when combined with the therapeutic composition retains the anti-tumor function of the therapeutic composition and is generally non-reactive with the patient's immune system. Examples include, but are not limited to, any of a number of standard pharmaceutical carriers such as sterile phosphate buffered saline solutions, bacteriostatic water, and the like (see, generally, Remington's Pharmaceutical Sciences 16Edition, A. Osal., Ed., 1980).","Glycosylation","Another type of covalent modification is alterations in glycosylation. In another embodiment, the antibodies disclosed herein can be modified to include one or more engineered glycoforms. By \u201cengineered glycoform\u201d as used herein is meant a carbohydrate composition that is covalently attached to the antibody, wherein said carbohydrate composition differs chemically from that of a parent antibody. Engineered glycoforms may be useful for a variety of purposes, including but not limited to enhancing or reducing effector function. A preferred form of engineered glycoform is afucosylation, which has been shown to be correlated to an increase in ADCC function, presumably through tighter binding to the Fc\u03b3RIIIa receptor. In this context, \u201cafucosylation\u201d means that the majority of the antibody produced in the host cells is substantially devoid of fucose, e.g. 90-95-98% of the generated antibodies do not have appreciable fucose as a component of the carbohydrate moiety of the antibody (generally attached at N297 in the Fc region). Defined functionally, afucosylated antibodies generally exhibit at least a 50% or higher affinity to the Fc\u03b3RIIIa receptor.","Engineered glycoforms may be generated by a variety of methods known in the art (Uma\u00f1a et al., 1999, Nat Biotechnol 17:176-180; Davies et al., 2001, Biotechnol Bioeng 74:288-294; Shields et al., 2002, J Biol Chem 277:26733-26740; Shinkawa et al., 2003, J Biol Chem 278:3466-3473; U.S. Pat. No. 6,602,684; U.S. Ser. No. 10\/277,370; U.S. Ser. No. 10\/113,929; PCT WO 00\/61739A1; PCT WO 01\/29246A1; PCT WO 02\/31140A1; PCT WO 02\/30954A1, all entirely incorporated by reference; (Potelligent\u00ae technology [Biowa, Inc., Princeton, N.J.]; GlycoMAb\u00ae glycosylation engineering technology [Glycart Biotechnology AG, Zurich, Switzerland]). Many of these techniques are based on controlling the level of fucosylated and\/or bisecting oligosaccharides that are covalently attached to the Fc region, for example by expressing an IgG in various organisms or cell lines, engineered or otherwise (for example Lec-13 CHO cells or rat hybridoma YB2\/0 cells, by regulating enzymes involved in the glycosylation pathway (for example FUT8 [\u03b11,6-fucosyltranserase] and\/or \u03b21-4-N-acetylglucosaminyltransferase III [GnTIII]), or by modifying carbohydrate(s) after the IgG has been expressed. For example, the \u201csugar engineered antibody\u201d or \u201cSEA technology\u201d of Seattle Genetics functions by adding modified saccharides that inhibit fucosylation during production; see for example 20090317869, hereby incorporated by reference in its entirety. Engineered glycoform typically refers to the different carbohydrate or oligosaccharide; thus an antibody can include an engineered glycoform.","Alternatively, engineered glycoform may refer to the IgG variant that comprises the different carbohydrate or oligosaccharide. As is known in the art, glycosylation patterns can depend on both the sequence of the protein (e.g., the presence or absence of particular glycosylation amino acid residues, discussed below), or the host cell or organism in which the protein is produced. Particular expression systems are discussed below.","Glycosylation of polypeptides is typically either N-linked or O-linked. N-linked refers to the attachment of the carbohydrate moiety to the side chain of an asparagine residue. The tri-peptide sequences asparagine-X-serine and asparagine-X-threonine, where X is any amino acid except proline, are the recognition sequences for enzymatic attachment of the carbohydrate moiety to the asparagine side chain. Thus, the presence of either of these tri-peptide sequences in a polypeptide creates a potential glycosylation site. O-linked glycosylation refers to the attachment of one of the sugars N-acetylgalactosamine, galactose, or xylose, to a hydroxyamino acid, most commonly serine or threonine, although 5-hydroxyproline or 5-hydroxylysine may also be used.","Addition of glycosylation sites to the antibody is conveniently accomplished by altering the amino acid sequence such that it contains one or more of the above-described tri-peptide sequences (for N-linked glycosylation sites). The alteration may also be made by the addition of, or substitution by, one or more serine or threonine residues to the starting sequence (for O-linked glycosylation sites). For ease, the antibody amino acid sequence is preferably altered through changes at the DNA level, particularly by mutating the DNA encoding the target polypeptide at preselected bases such that codons are generated that will translate into the desired amino acids.","Another means of increasing the number of carbohydrate moieties on the antibody is by chemical or enzymatic coupling of glycosides to the protein. These procedures are advantageous in that they do not require production of the protein in a host cell that has glycosylation capabilities for N- and O-linked glycosylation. Depending on the coupling mode used, the sugar(s) may be attached to (a) arginine and histidine, (b) free carboxyl groups, (c) free sulfhydryl groups such as those of cysteine, (d) free hydroxyl groups such as those of serine, threonine, or hydroxyproline, (e) aromatic residues such as those of phenylalanine, tyrosine, or tryptophan, or (f) the amide group of glutamine These methods are described in WO 87\/05330 and in Aplin and Wriston, 1981, CRC Crit. Rev. Biochem., pp. 259-306, both entirely incorporated by reference.","Removal of carbohydrate moieties present on the starting antibody (e.g. post-translationally) may be accomplished chemically or enzymatically. Chemical deglycosylation requires exposure of the protein to the compound trifluoromethanesulfonic acid, or an equivalent compound. This treatment results in the cleavage of most or all sugars except the linking sugar (N-acetylglucosamine or N-acetylgalactosamine), while leaving the polypeptide intact. Chemical deglycosylation is described by Hakimuddin et al., 1987, Arch. Biochem. Biophys. 259:52 and by Edge et al., 1981, Anal. Biochem. 118:131, both entirely incorporated by reference. Enzymatic cleavage of carbohydrate moieties on polypeptides can be achieved by the use of a variety of endo- and exo-glycosidases as described by Thotakura et al., 1987, Meth. Enzymol. 138:350, entirely incorporated by reference. Glycosylation at potential glycosylation sites may be prevented by the use of the compound tunicamycin as described by Duskin et al., 1982, J. Biol. Chem. 257:3105, entirely incorporated by reference. Tunicamycin blocks the formation of protein-N-glycoside linkages.","Another type of covalent modification of the antibody comprises linking the antibody to various nonproteinaceous polymers, including, but not limited to, various polyols such as polyethylene glycol, polypropylene glycol or polyoxyalkylenes, in the manner set forth in, for example, 2005-2006 PEG Catalog from Nektar Therapeutics (available at the Nektar website) U.S. Pat. No. 4,640,835; 4,496,689; 4,301,144; 4,670,417; 4,791,192 or 4,179,337, all entirely incorporated by reference. In addition, as is known in the art, amino acid substitutions may be made in various positions within the antibody to facilitate the addition of polymers such as PEG. See for example, U.S. Publication No. 2005\/0114037A1, entirely incorporated by reference.","Included within the invention are the nucleic acids encoding the Fc variant antibodies of the invention. In the case where both a heavy and light chain constant domains are included in the Fc variant antibody, generally these are made using nucleic acids encoding each, that are combined into standard host cells (e.g. CHO cells, etc.) to produce the tetrameric structure of the antibody. If only one Fc variant engineered constant domain is being made, only a single nucleic acid will be used.","The use of the Fc variant antibodies of the invention in therapy will depend on the antigen binding component; e.g. in the case of full length standard therapeutic antibodies, on the antigen to which the antibody's Fv binds. That is, as will be appreciated by those in the art, the treatment of specific diseases can be done with the additional benefit of increased half life of the molecule. This can result in a variety of benefits, including, but not limited to, less frequent dosing (which can lead to better patient compliance), lower dosing, and lower production costs.","Formulations of the antibodies used in accordance with the present invention are prepared for storage by mixing an antibody having the desired degree of purity with optional pharmaceutically acceptable carriers, excipients or stabilizers (Remington's Pharmaceutical Sciences 16th edition, Osol, A. Ed. [1980]), in the form of lyophilized formulations or aqueous solutions. Acceptable carriers, excipients, or stabilizers are nontoxic to recipients at the dosages and concentrations employed, and include buffers such as phosphate, citrate, and other organic acids; antioxidants including ascorbic acid and methionine; preservatives (such as octadecyldimethylbenzyl ammonium chloride; hexamethonium chloride; benzalkonium chloride, benzethonium chloride; phenol, butyl or benzyl alcohol; alkyl parabens such as methyl or propyl paraben; catechol; resorcinol; cyclohexanol; 3-pentanol; and m-cresol); low molecular weight (less than about 10 residues) polypeptides; proteins, such as serum albumin, gelatin, or immunoglobulins; hydrophilic polymers such as polyvinylpyrrolidone; amino acids such as glycine, glutamine, asparagine, histidine, arginine, or lysine; monosaccharides, disaccharides, and other carbohydrates including glucose, mannose, or dextrins; chelating agents such as EDTA; sugars such as sucrose, mannitol, trehalose or sorbitol; salt-forming counter-ions such as sodium; metal complexes (e.g. Zn-protein complexes); and\/or non-ionic surfactants such as TWEENT\u2122, PLURONICS\u2122 or polyethylene glycol (PEG).","The formulation herein may also contain more than one active compound as necessary for the particular indication being treated, preferably those with complementary activities that do not adversely affect each other. For example, it may be desirable to provide antibodies with other specificities. Alternatively, or in addition, the composition may comprise a cytotoxic agent, cytokine, growth inhibitory agent and\/or small molecule antagonist. Such molecules are suitably present in combination in amounts that are effective for the purpose intended.","The active ingredients may also be entrapped in microcapsules prepared, for example, by coacervation techniques or by interfacial polymerization, for example, hydroxymethylcellulose or gelatin-microcapsules and poly-(methylmethacylate) microcapsules, respectively, in colloidal drug delivery systems (for example, liposomes, albumin microspheres, microemulsions, nano-particles and nanocapsules) or in macroemulsions. Such techniques are disclosed in Remington's Pharmaceutical Sciences 16th edition, Osol, A. Ed. (1980).","The formulations to be used for in vivo administration should be sterile, or nearly so. This is readily accomplished by filtration through sterile filtration membranes.","Sustained-release preparations may be prepared. Suitable examples of sustained-release preparations include semipermeable matrices of solid hydrophobic polymers containing the antibody, which matrices are in the form of shaped articles, e.g. films, or microcapsules. Examples of sustained-release matrices include polyesters, hydrogels (for example, poly(2-hydroxyethyl-methacrylate), or poly(vinylalcohol)), polylactides (U.S. Pat. No. 3,773,919), copolymers of L-glutamic acid and .gamma ethyl-L-glutamate, non-degradable ethylene-vinyl acetate, degradable lactic acid-glycolic acid copolymers such as the LUPRON DEPOT\u2122 (injectable microspheres composed of lactic acid-glycolic acid copolymer and leuprolide acetate), and poly-D-(\u2212)-3-hydroxybutyric acid. While polymers such as ethylene-vinyl acetate and lactic acid-glycolic acid enable release of molecules for over 100 days, certain hydrogels release proteins for shorter time periods.","When encapsulated antibodies remain in the body for a long time, they may denature or aggregate as a result of exposure to moisture at 37\u00b0 C., resulting in a loss of biological activity and possible changes in immunogenicity. Rational strategies can be devised for stabilization depending on the mechanism involved. For example, if the aggregation mechanism is discovered to be intermolecular S\u2014S bond formation through thio-disulfide interchange, stabilization may be achieved by modifying sulfhydryl residues, lyophilizing from acidic solutions, controlling moisture content, using appropriate additives, and developing specific polymer matrix compositions.","The antibodies and chemotherapeutic agents of the invention are administered to a subject, in accord with known methods, such as intravenous administration as a bolus or by continuous infusion over a period of time, by intramuscular, intraperitoneal, intracerobrospinal, subcutaneous, intra-articular, intrasynovial, intrathecal, oral, topical, or inhalation routes. Intravenous or subcutaneous administration of the antibody is preferred.","In the methods of the invention, therapy is used to provide a positive therapeutic response with respect to a disease or condition. By \u201cpositive therapeutic response\u201d is intended an improvement in the disease or condition, and\/or an improvement in the symptoms associated with the disease or condition. For example, a positive therapeutic response would refer to one or more of the following improvements in the disease: (1) a reduction in the number of neoplastic cells; (2) an increase in neoplastic cell death; (3) inhibition of neoplastic cell survival; (5) inhibition (i.e., slowing to some extent, preferably halting) of tumor growth; (6) an increased patient survival rate; and (7) some relief from one or more symptoms associated with the disease or condition.","Positive therapeutic responses in any given disease or condition can be determined by standardized response criteria specific to that disease or condition. Tumor response can be assessed for changes in tumor morphology (i.e., overall tumor burden, tumor size, and the like) using screening techniques such as magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) scan, x-radiographic imaging, computed tomographic (CT) scan, bone scan imaging, endoscopy, and tumor biopsy sampling including bone marrow aspiration (BMA) and counting of tumor cells in the circulation.","In addition to these positive therapeutic responses, the subject undergoing therapy may experience the beneficial effect of an improvement in the symptoms associated with the disease.","Thus for B cell tumors, the subject may experience a decrease in the so-called B symptoms, i.e., night sweats, fever, weight loss, and\/or urticaria. For pre-malignant conditions, therapy with an Fc variant therapeutic agent may block and\/or prolong the time before development of a related malignant condition, for example, development of multiple myeloma in subjects suffering from monoclonal gammopathy of undetermined significance (MGUS).","An improvement in the disease may be characterized as a complete response. By \u201ccomplete response\u201d is intended an absence of clinically detectable disease with normalization of any previously abnormal radiographic studies, bone marrow, and cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) or abnormal monoclonal protein in the case of myeloma.","Such a response may persist for at least 4 to 8 weeks, or sometimes 6 to 8 weeks, following treatment according to the methods of the invention. Alternatively, an improvement in the disease may be categorized as being a partial response. By \u201cpartial response\u201d is intended at least about a 50% decrease in all measurable tumor burden (i.e., the number of malignant cells present in the subject, or the measured bulk of tumor masses or the quantity of abnormal monoclonal protein) in the absence of new lesions, which may persist for 4 to 8 weeks, or 6 to 8 weeks.","Treatment according to the present invention includes a \u201ctherapeutically effective amount\u201d of the medicaments used. A \u201ctherapeutically effective amount\u201d refers to an amount effective, at dosages and for periods of time necessary, to achieve a desired therapeutic result.","A therapeutically effective amount may vary according to factors such as the disease state, age, sex, and weight of the individual, and the ability of the medicaments to elicit a desired response in the individual. A therapeutically effective amount is also one in which any toxic or detrimental effects of the antibody or antibody portion are outweighed by the therapeutically beneficial effects.","A \u201ctherapeutically effective amount\u201d for tumor therapy may also be measured by its ability to stabilize the progression of disease. The ability of a compound to inhibit cancer may be evaluated in an animal model system predictive of efficacy in human tumors.","Alternatively, this property of a composition may be evaluated by examining the ability of the compound to inhibit cell growth or to induce apoptosis by in vitro assays known to the skilled practitioner. A therapeutically effective amount of a therapeutic compound may decrease tumor size, or otherwise ameliorate symptoms in a subject. One of ordinary skill in the art would be able to determine such amounts based on such factors as the subject's size, the severity of the subject's symptoms, and the particular composition or route of administration selected.","Dosage regimens are adjusted to provide the optimum desired response (e.g., a therapeutic response). For example, a single bolus may be administered, several divided doses may be administered over time or the dose may be proportionally reduced or increased as indicated by the exigencies of the therapeutic situation. Parenteral compositions may be formulated in dosage unit form for ease of administration and uniformity of dosage. Dosage unit form as used herein refers to physically discrete units suited as unitary dosages for the subjects to be treated; each unit contains a predetermined quantity of active compound calculated to produce the desired therapeutic effect in association with the required pharmaceutical carrier.","The specification for the dosage unit forms of the present invention are dictated by and directly dependent on (a) the unique characteristics of the active compound and the particular therapeutic effect to be achieved, and (b) the limitations inherent in the art of compounding such an active compound for the treatment of sensitivity in individuals.","The efficient dosages and the dosage regimens for the Fc variant antibodies used in the present invention depend on the disease or condition to be treated and may be determined by the persons skilled in the art.","An exemplary, non-limiting range for a therapeutically effective amount of an Fc variant antibody used in the present invention is about 0.1-100 mg\/kg, such as about 0.1-50 mg\/kg, for example about 0.1-20 mg\/kg, such as about 0.1-10 mg\/kg, for instance about 0.5, about such as 0.3, about 1, or about 3 mg\/kg. In another embodiment, the antibody is administered in a dose of 1 mg\/kg or more, such as a dose of from 1 to 20 mg\/kg, e.g. a dose of from 5 to 20 mg\/kg, e.g. a dose of 8 mg\/kg.","A medical professional having ordinary skill in the art may readily determine and prescribe the effective amount of the pharmaceutical composition required. For example, a physician or a veterinarian could start doses of the medicament employed in the pharmaceutical composition at levels lower than that required in order to achieve the desired therapeutic effect and gradually increase the dosage until the desired effect is achieved.","In one embodiment, the Fc variant antibody is administered by infusion in a weekly dosage of from 10 to 500 mg\/kg such as of from 200 to 400 mg\/kg Such administration may be repeated, e.g., 1 to 8 times, such as 3 to 5 times. The administration may be performed by continuous infusion over a period of from 2 to 24 hours, such as of from 2 to 12 hours.","In one embodiment, the Fc variant antibody is administered by slow continuous infusion over a long period, such as more than 24 hours, if required to reduce side effects including toxicity.","In one embodiment the Fc variant antibody is administered in a weekly dosage of from 250 mg to 2000 mg, such as for example 300 mg, 500 mg, 700 mg, 1000 mg, 1500 mg or 2000 mg, for up to 8 times, such as from 4 to 6 times. The administration may be performed by continuous infusion over a period of from 2 to 24 hours, such as of from 2 to 12 hours. Such regimen may be repeated one or more times as necessary, for example, after 6 months or 12 months. The dosage may be determined or adjusted by measuring the amount of compound of the present invention in the blood upon administration by for instance taking out a biological sample and using anti-idiotypic antibodies which target the antigen binding region of the Fc variantantibody.","In a further embodiment, the Fc variant antibody is administered once weekly for 2 to 12 weeks, such as for 3 to 10 weeks, such as for 4 to 8 weeks.","In one embodiment, the Fc variant antibody is administered by maintenance therapy, such as, e.g., once a week for a period of 6 months or more.","In one embodiment, the Fc variant antibody is administered by a regimen including one infusion of an Fc variant antibody followed by an infusion of an Fc variant antibody conjugated to a radioisotope. The regimen may be repeated, e.g., 7 to 9 days later.","As non-limiting examples, treatment according to the present invention may be provided as a daily dosage of an antibody in an amount of about 0.1-100 mg\/kg, such as 0.5, 0.9, 1.0, 1.1, 1.5, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10, 11, 12, 13, 14, 15, 16, 17, 18, 19, 20, 21, 22, 23, 24, 25, 26, 27, 28, 29, 30, 40, 45, 50, 60, 70, 80, 90 or 100 mg\/kg, per day, on at least one of day 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10, 11, 12, 13, 14, 15, 16, 17, 18, 19, 20, 21, 22, 23, 24, 25, 26, 27, 28, 29, 30, 31, 32, 33, 34, 35, 36, 37, 38, 39, or 40, or alternatively, at least one of week 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10, 11, 12, 13, 14, 15, 16, 17, 18, 19 or 20 after initiation of treatment, or any combination thereof, using single or divided doses of every 24, 12, 8, 6, 4, or 2 hours, or any combination thereof.","In some embodiments the Fc variant antibody molecule thereof is used in combination with one or more additional therapeutic agents, e.g. a chemotherapeutic agent. Non-limiting examples of DNA damaging chemotherapeutic agents include topoisomerase I inhibitors (e.g., irinotecan, topotecan, camptothecin and analogs or metabolites thereof, and doxorubicin); topoisomerase II inhibitors (e.g., etoposide, teniposide, and daunorubicin); alkylating agents (e.g., melphalan, chlorambucil, busulfan, thiotepa, ifosfamide, carmustine, lomustine, semustine, streptozocin, decarbazine, methotrexate, mitomycin C, and cyclophosphamide); DNA intercalators (e.g., cisplatin, oxaliplatin, and carboplatin); DNA intercalators and free radical generators such as bleomycin; and nucleoside mimetics (e.g., 5-fluorouracil, capecitibine, gemcitabine, fludarabine, cytarabine, mercaptopurine, thioguanine, pentostatin, and hydroxyurea).","Chemotherapeutic agents that disrupt cell replication include: paclitaxel, docetaxel, and related analogs; vincristine, vinblastin, and related analogs; thalidomide, lenalidomide, and related analogs (e.g., CC-5013 and CC-4047); protein tyrosine kinase inhibitors (e.g., imatinib mesylate and gefitinib); proteasome inhibitors (e.g., bortezomib); NF-\u03baB inhibitors, including inhibitors of I\u03baB kinase; antibodies which bind to proteins overexpressed in cancers and thereby downregulate cell replication (e.g., trastuzumab, rituximab, cetuximab, and bevacizumab); and other inhibitors of proteins or enzymes known to be upregulated, over-expressed or activated in cancers, the inhibition of which downregulates cell replication.","In some embodiments, the antibodies of the invention can be used prior to, concurrent with, or after treatment with Velcade\u00ae (bortezomib).","Examples are provided below to illustrate the present invention. These examples are not meant to constrain the present invention to any particular application or theory of operation. For all constant region positions discussed in the present invention, numbering is according to the EU index as in Kabat (Kabat et al., 19915th Ed., United States Public Health Service, National Institutes of Health, Bethesda, entirely incorporated by reference). Those skilled in the art of antibodies will appreciate that this convention consists of nonsequential numbering in specific regions of an immunoglobulin sequence, enabling a normalized reference to conserved positions in immunoglobulin families. Accordingly, the positions of any given immunoglobulin as defined by the EU index will not necessarily correspond to its sequential sequence.","Amino acid modifications were engineered in the Fc region of IgG antibodies to improve their affinity for the neonatoal Fc receptor FcRn. Variants were screened in the context of a number of different human IgG constant chains (), including IgG1, IgG2, and a hybrid IgG sequences that contains the CH1 and upper hinge of IgG1 and the Fc region of IgG2. It will be appreciated by those skilled in the art that because of the different interactions of the IgG1 and IgG2 Fc region with Fc\u03b3Rs and complement, these different parent Fc regions will have different Fc\u03b3R- and complement-mediated effector function properties. Exemplary sequences of Fc variants in the context of these parent IgG constant chains are shown in .","Fc variants were engineered in the context of an antibody targeting vascular endothelial factor (VEGF). The heavy and light chain variable regions (VH and VL) are those of a humanized version of the antibody A4.6.1, also referred to as bevacizumab (Avastin\u00ae), which is approved for the treatment of a variety of cancers. The amino acid sequences of the VH and VL regions of this antibody are shown in .","Genes encoding the heavy and light chains of the anti-VEGF antibodies were contructed in the mammalian expression vector pTTS. Human IgG1 and IgG2 constant chain genes were obtained from IMAGE clones and subcloned into the pTTS vector. The IgG1\/2 gene was constructed using PCR mutagenesis. VH and VL genes encoding the anti-VEGF antibodies were synthesized commercially (Blue Heron Biotechnologies, Bothell Wash.), and subcloned into the vectors encoding the appropriate CL, IgG1, IgG2, and IgG1\/2 constant chains Amino acid modifications were constructed using site-directed mutagenesis using the QuikChange\u00ae site-directed mutagenesis methods (Stratagene, La Jolla Calif.). All DNA was sequenced to confirm the fidelity of the sequences.","Plasmids containing heavy chain gene (VH-C\u03b31-C\u03b32-C\u03b33) were co-transfected with plasmid containing light chain gene (VL-C\u03ba) into 293E cells using llipofectamine (Invitrogen, Carlsbad Calif.) and grown in FreeStyle 293 media (Invitrogen, Carlsbad Calif.). After 5 days of growth, the antibodies were purified from the culture supernatant by protein A affinity using the MabSelect resin (GE Healthcare). Antibody concentrations were determined by bicinchoninic acid (BCA) assay (Pierce).","The fidelity of the expressed variant antibodies was confirmed by demonstrating that they maintained specificity for antigen. VEGF binding was monitored using surface plasmon resonance (SPR, Biacore), performed using a Biacore 3000 instrument. Recombinant VEGF (VEGF-165, PeproTech, Rocky Hill, N.J.) was adhered to a CMS chip surface by coupling with N-hydroxysuccinimide\/N-ethyl-N\u2032-(\u22123-dimethylamino-propyl)carbodiimide (NHS\/EDC) using standard methods. WT and variant antibodies were injected as analytes, and response, measured in resonance units (RU), was acquired. The dissociation phase was too slow to measure true equilibrium constants, and so relative binding was determined by measuring RU's at the end of the association phase, which should be proportional to the protein concentration (which is held constant in the experiment) and the association rate constant. The data () show that the variant anti-VEGF antibodies maintain binding to antigen, in contrast to the negative control anti-Her2 antibody which does not bind VEGF.","Binding of variant antibodies to human FcRn was measured at pH 6.0, the pH at which it is naturally bound in endosomes. Vectors encoding beta 2 microglobulin and His-tagged alpha chain genes of FcRn were constructed, co-transfected into 293T cells, and purified using nickel chromatography. Antibody affinity for human FcRn (hFcRn) at pH 6.0 was measured on a Biacore 3000 instrument by coupling human FcRn to a CMS chip surface using standard NHS\/EDC chemistry. WT and variant antibodies were used in the mobile phase at 25-100 nM concentration and response was measured in resonance units. Association and dissocation phases at pH 6.0 were acquired, followed by an injection of pH 7.4 buffer to measure release of antibody from receptor at the higher pH. A cycle with antibody and buffer only provided baseline response, which was subtracted from each sample sensorgram.",{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0219","num":"0218"},"figref":"FIG. 6"},"The FcRn association\/dissociation curves did not fit to a simple Langmuir model, possibly due to the antibody and receptor multi-valency or chip heterogeneity. Pseudo-Ka values (referred to as Ka*) were determined by fitting to a conformational change model with the change in refractive index (RI) fixed at 0 RU. These values for select variant antibodies are plotted in . The relative affinity of each variant as compared to its parent IgG was calculated according to the equation Fold=(WT Ka*\/Variant Ka*).","To test the ability of select variants to improve half-life in vivo, pharmacokinetic experiments were performed in B6 mice that are homozygous knock-outs for murine FcRn and heterozygous knock-ins of human FcRn (mFcRn, hFcRn) (Petkova et al., 2006, Int Immunol 18(12):1759-69, entirely incorporated by reference), herein referred to as hFcRn or hFcRn mice. A single, intravenous tail vein injection of anti-VEGF antibody (2 mg\/kg) was given to groups of 4-7 female mice randomized by body weight (20-30 g range). Blood (\u02dc50 ul) was drawn from the orbital plexus at each time point, processed to serum, and stored at \u221280\u00b0 C. until analysis. Study durations were 28 or 49 days.","Antibody concentrations were determined using two ELISA assays. In the first two studies (referred to as Study 1 and Study 2), goat anti-human Fc antibody (Jackson Immuno research) was adhered to the plate, wells were washed with PBST (phosphate buffered saline with 0.05% Tween) and blocked with 3% BSA in PBST. Serum or calibration standards were the added, followed by PBST washing, addition of europium labeled anti-human IgG (Perkin Elmer), and further PBST washing. The time resolved fluorescence signal was collected. For Studies 3-5, serum concentration was detected using a similar ELISA, but recombinant VEGF (VEGF-165, PeproTech, Rocky Hill, N.J.) was used as capture reagent and detection was carried out with biotinylated anti-human kappa antibody and europium-labeled streptavidin. PK parameters were determined for individual mice with a non-compartmental model using WinNonLin (Pharsight Inc, Mountain View Calif.). Nominal times and dose were used with uniform weighing of points. The time points used (lambda Z ranges) were from 4 days to the end of the study, although all time points were used for the faster clearing mutants, P257N and P257L.","Five antibody PK studies in mFcRn hFcRn mice were carried out.  shows serum concentration data for WT and variant IgG1 (Study 3) and IgG2 (Study 5) antibodies respectively. Fitted PK parameters from all in vivo PK studies carried out in mFcRn hFcRn mice are provided in . PK data include half-life, which represents the beta phase that characterizes elimination of antibody from serum, Cmax, which represents the maximal observed serum concentration, AUC, which represents the area under the concentration time curve, and clearance, which represents the clearance of antibody from serum. Also provided for each variant is the calculated fold improvement or reduction in half-life relative to the IgG1 or IgG2 parent antibody [Fold half-life=half-life(variant)\/half-life (WT)].","The PK properties of biologics in non-human primates are well-established to be predictive of their properties in humans. A PK study was carried out in cynomolgus monkeys () in order to evaluate the capacity of the variant anti-VEGF antibodies to improve serum half-life in non-human primates.","In preparation for a PK study in cynomolgus monkeys, binding of the variant antibodies to cynomolgus (cyno) FcRn (cFcRn) at pH 6.0 was measured. cFcRn was constructed, expressed, and purified as described above for human FcRn. Binding of variant anti-VEGF antibodies to cFcRn was measured using Biacore as described above. The data are provided in . The results show that the variants improve affinity for cyno FcRn similarly as they do for human FcRn. Dissociation at the higher pH (7.4) was also very rapid (data not shown), similar to as was observed for binding to human FcRn. These results are not surprising given the high sequence homology of the human and cyno receptors (FcRn alpha chain 96%, beta-2-microglobulin 91%).","The PK of the variants were studied in vivo in non-human primates. Male cynomolgus monkeys (, also called crab-eating Macaque) weighing 2.3-5.1 kg were randomized by weight and divided into 5 groups with 3 monkeys per group. The monkeys were given a single, 1 hour peripheral vein infusion of 4 mg\/kg antibody. Blood samples (1 ml) were drawn from a separate vein from 5 minutes to 90 days after completion of the infusion, processed to serum and stored at \u221270 C. Animals were not harmed during these studies.","Antibody concentrations were determined using the VEGF capture method as described above. PK parameters were determined by fitting the concentrations versus time to a non-compartmental model as was done in the mouse PK studies. However, time points from day 10 to day 90 were used for PK parameter determinations. The PK results are plotted in , and the fitted parameters are provided in . The results show that the variants enhanced the in vivo half-life of antibody up to 3.2-fold. In the best case (the 428L\/434S variant) half-life was extended from 9.7 days to 31.1 days. The PK results obtained in cynomolgus monkeys are consistent with those obtained in mFcRn hFcRn mice, validating the hFcRn mouse model as a system for assessing the in vivo PK properties of the variants, and supporting the conclusions from those studies.","New variants were engineered to further screen for modifications that extend in vivo half-life. Designed substitutions are shown in . Variants were constructed in the context of an antibody with the bevacizumab variant region and IgG1\/2 N434S constant region; however, variants may be constructed in any IgG isotype. Variants were constructed, expressed, and purified as described above.","Variants were screened for binding to human FcRn at pH 6.0 by Biacore. Anti-VEGF antibodies were captured to a VEGF coupled chip, a single concentration of FcRn analyte was flowed over the chip (association phase), and then buffer was washed over to dissociatie FcRn analyte (dissociation phase). The dissociation off-rate (k) was determined by fitting the dissociation phase data to a 1:1 Langmuir dissociation model. The results are shown numerically in , and plotted in . As can be seen, a number of the designed variants improve FcRn binding (reduce the k) relative to the IgG1\/2 N434S background.","The FcRn binding of select variants was tested using the same Biacore format but with an analyte (FcRn) concentration series in order to obtain accurate equilibrium dissociation constants (Ks). Sensorgrams at multiple analyte concentrations were fit globally to a 1:1 Langmuir binding model. Resulting kinetic and equilibrium binding constants are presented in , along with the Fold Kand Fold krelative to IgG1 WT and IgG1\/2 N434S respectively. Data are plotted in . A number of variants, comprising several different substitutions improve binding to human FcRn. Beneficial substitutions include but are not limited to T307Q, Q311I, Q311V, A378V, S426V, S426T, Y436I, and Y436V. The successful engineering at positions 378 and 426 is surprising giving that they are more distal to the FcRn binding interface on Fc.","Additional substitutions were designed to explore whether other substitutions at these positions may provide improved binding to FcRn. These variants are listed in FIG. . Based on the collective data, a new library of variant combinations was designed to further screen for Fc variants that have the potential to extend antibody half-life in vivo. These variants are listed in .","Variants were constructed, expressed, and purified as described above. Variants were screened for binding to human FcRn at pH 6.0 by Biacore. Anti-VEGF antibodies were captured to a VEGF coupled chip, a single concentration of FcRn analyte was flowed over the chip (association phase), and then buffer was washed over to dissociatie FcRn analyte (dissociation phase). The dissociation off-rate (k) was determined by fitting the dissociation phase data to a 1:1 Langmuir dissociation model. The results are shown numerically in , and plotted in . As can be seen, a number of the designed variants improve FcRn binding (reduce the k).","In vivo pharmacokinetic properties of the variants were tested in hFcRn mice as described above. A single, intravenous tail vein injection of anti-VEGF antibody (2 mg\/kg) was given. Antibody concentrations were determined using the VEGF-capture ELISA assay described above.  shows mean serum concentration data for Fc variant and IgG1\/2 parent anti-VEGF antibodies. Fitted half-lives of individual mice and means are provided in .  shows a scatter plot of the fitted half-lives from the individual mice in the study. The results indicate that the engineered Fc variants extend half-life relative to the parent IgG1\/2 antibody, as well as the IgG1\/2 N434S variant.","Whereas particular embodiments of the invention have been described above for purposes of illustration, it will be appreciated by those skilled in the art that numerous variations of the details may be made without departing from the invention as described in the appended claims.
