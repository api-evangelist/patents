title: Method of fabricating an ink jet nozzle with a heater element
abstract: The invention relates to a method of fabricating an ink jet nozzle. The method includes the steps of depositing and etching a passivation layer on a silicon substrate having drive circuitry and an interlayer dielectric interconnect to form a first sacrificial scaffold. Also included are the steps of depositing heater material over the first sacrificial scaffold and etching said heater material to define a heater element, and depositing and developing a layer of photoresist to define a second sacrificial scaffold defining sidewalls for a nozzle chamber. The method also includes the steps of depositing silicon nitride onto the second sacrificial scaffold to form a roof over the nozzle chamber, and etching a nozzle aperture through the roof down to the second sacrificial scaffold.

present invention relates to the field of inkjet printers and, discloses an inkjet printing system using printheads manufactured with microelectro-mechanical systems (MEMS) techniques.","Many different types of printing have been invented, a large number of which are presently in use. The known forms of print have a variety of methods for marking the print media with a relevant marking media. Commonly used forms of printing include offset printing, laser printing and copying devices, dot matrix type impact printers, thermal paper printers, film recorders, thermal wax printers, dye sublimation printers and ink jet printers both of the drop on demand and continuous flow type. Each type of printer has its own advantages and problems when considering cost, speed, quality, reliability, simplicity of construction and operation etc.","In recent years, the field of ink jet printing, wherein each individual pixel of ink is derived from one or more ink nozzles has become increasingly popular primarily due to its inexpensive and versatile nature.","Many different techniques on ink jet printing have been invented. For a survey of the field, reference is made to an article by J Moore, \u201cNon-Impact Printing: Introduction and Historical Perspective\u201d, Output Hard Copy Devices, Editors R Dubeck and S Sherr, pages 207-220 (1988).","Ink Jet printers themselves come in many different types. The utilization of a continuous stream of ink in ink jet printing appears to date back to at least 1929 wherein U.S. Pat. No. 1,941,001 by Hansell discloses a simple form of continuous stream electro-static ink jet printing.","U.S. Pat. No. 3,596,275 by Sweet also discloses a process of a continuous ink jet printing including the step wherein the ink jet stream is modulated by a high frequency electro-static field so as to cause drop separation. This technique is still utilized by several manufacturers including Elmjet and Scitex (see also U.S. Pat. No. 3,373,437 by Sweet et al)","Piezoelectric ink jet printers are also one form of commonly utilized ink jet printing device. Piezoelectric systems are disclosed by Kyser et. al. in U.S. Pat. No. 3,946,398 (1970) which utilizes a diaphragm mode of operation, by Zolten in U.S. Pat. No. 3,683,212 (1970) which discloses a squeeze mode of operation of a piezoelectric crystal, Stemme in U.S. Pat. No. 3,747,120 (1972) discloses a bend mode of piezoelectric operation, Howkins in U.S. Pat. No. 4,459,601 discloses a piezoelectric push mode actuation of the ink jet stream and Fischbeck in U.S. Pat. No. 4,584,590 which discloses a shear mode type of piezoelectric transducer element.","Recently, thermal ink jet printing has become an extremely popular form of ink jet printing. The ink jet printing techniques include those disclosed by Endo et al in GB 2007162 (1979) and Vaught et al in U.S. Pat. No. 4,490,728. Both the aforementioned references disclosed ink jet printing techniques that rely upon the activation of an electrothermal actuator which results in the creation of a bubble in a constricted space, such as a nozzle, which thereby causes the ejection of ink from an aperture connected to the confined space onto a relevant print media. Printing devices utilizing the electro-thermal actuator are manufactured by manufacturers such as Canon and Hewlett Packard.","As can be seen from the foregoing, many different types of printing technologies are available. Ideally, a printing technology should have a number of desirable attributes. These include inexpensive construction and operation, high speed operation, safe and continuous long term operation etc. Each technology may have its own advantages and disadvantages in the areas of cost, speed, quality, reliability, power usage, simplicity of construction operation, durability and consumables.","A problem with inkjet printheads, and especially inkjet printheads having a high nozzle density, is that ink can flood across the printhead surface contaminating adjacent nozzles. This is undesirable because it results in reduced print quality. Moreover, cross-contamination of ink across the printhead surface can potentially result in electrolysis and accelerated corrosion of nozzle actuators.","Previous attempts to minimize ink flooding across the printhead surface typically involve coating the printhead with a hydrophobic material. However, hydrophobic coatings have only had limited success in minimizing the extent of flooding.","A further problem with inkjet printheads, especially inkjet printheads having sensitive MEMS nozzles formed on an ink ejection surface of the printhead, is that the nozzle structures can become damaged by cleaning the printhead surface. Typically, printheads are wiped regularly to remove particles of paper dust or paper fibers, which build up on the ink ejection surface. When a wiping mechanism comes into contact with nozzle structures on the printhead surface, there is an obvious risk of damaging the nozzles.","It would be desirable to provide a printhead, which minimizes cross-contamination by ink flooding between adjacent nozzles. It would be further desirable to provide a printhead, which allows regular cleaning of the printhead surface by a wiping mechanism without risk of damaging nozzle structures on the printhead.","In a first aspect, there is provided a printhead comprising:","a substrate including a plurality of nozzles for ejecting ink droplets onto a print medium, each nozzle having a nozzle aperture defined in an ink ejection surface of the substrate; and","a plurality of formations on the ink ejection surface, the surface formations being configured to isolate each nozzle from at least one adjacent nozzle.","In a second aspect, there is provided a method of operating a printhead, whilst minimizing cross-contamination of ink between adjacent nozzles, the method comprising the steps of:","(a) providing a printhead comprising:","a substrate including a plurality of nozzles for ejecting ink droplets onto a print medium, each nozzles having a nozzle aperture defined in an ink ejection surface of the substrate; and","a plurality of formations on the ink ejection surface, the surface formations being configured to isolate each nozzle from at least one adjacent nozzle; and","(b) printing onto a print medium using said printhead.","In a third aspect, there is provided a method of fabricating a printhead having isolated nozzles, the method comprising the steps of:","(a) providing a substrate, the substrate including a plurality of nozzles for ejecting ink droplets onto a print medium, each nozzle having a nozzle aperture defined in an ink ejection surface of the substrate;","(b) depositing a layer of photoresist over the ink ejection surface;","(c) defining recesses in the photoresist, each recess revealing a portion of the ink ejection surface surrounding a respective nozzle aperture;","(d) depositing a roof material over the photoresist and into the recesses;","(e) etching the roof material to define a nozzle enclosure around each nozzle aperture, each nozzle enclosure having an opening defined in a roof and sidewalls extending from the roof to the ink ejection surface; and","(f) removing the photoresist.","Optionally, the formations have a hydrophobic surface. Inkjet inks are typically aqueous-based inks and hydrophobic formations will repel any flooded ink. Hence, hydrophobic formations minimize as far as possible any cross-contamination of ink by acting as a physical barrier and by intermolecular repulsive forces. Moreover, hydrophobic formations promote ingestion of any flooded ink back into respective nozzle chambers and ink supply channels. Since nozzle chambers are typically hydrophilic, ink will tend to be drawn back into the nozzle and away from a surrounding hydrophobic formation.","Optionally, the formations are arranged in a plurality of nozzle enclosures, each nozzle enclosure comprising sidewalls surrounding a respective nozzle, the sidewalls forming a seal with the ink ejection surface. Hence, each nozzle is isolated from its adjacent nozzles by a nozzle enclosure.","Optionally, each nozzle enclosure further comprises a roof spaced apart from the respective nozzle, the roof having a roof opening aligned with a respective nozzle opening for allowing ejected ink droplets to pass therethrough onto the print medium. Hence, each nozzle enclosure may typically take the form of a cap, which covers or encapsulates an individual nozzle on the ink ejection surface. The roof not only provides additional containment of any flooded ink, it also provides further protection of each nozzle from, for example, the potentially damaging effects of paper dust, paper fibers or wiping.","Typically, the sidewalls extend from a perimeter region of each roof to the ink ejection surface. Sidewalls of adjacent nozzle enclosures are usually spaced apart across the ink ejection surface.","Optionally, the printhead is an inkjet printhead, such as a pagewidth inkjet printhead. Optionally, the printhead has a nozzle density, which is sufficient to print at up to 1600 dpi. The present invention is particularly beneficial for printheads having a high nozzle density, because high density printheads are especially prone to flooding between adjacent nozzles.","Bubble Forming Heater Element Actuator","With reference to , the unit cell  of one of the Applicant's printheads is shown. The unit cell  comprises a nozzle plate  with nozzles  therein, the nozzles having nozzle rims , and apertures  extending through the nozzle plate. The nozzle plate  is plasma etched from a silicon nitride structure which is deposited, by way of chemical vapor deposition (CVD), over a sacrificial material which is subsequently etched.","The printhead also includes, with respect to each nozzle , side walls  on which the nozzle plate is supported, a chamber  defined by the walls and the nozzle plate , a multi-layer substrate  and an inlet passage  extending through the multi-layer substrate to the far side (not shown) of the substrate. A looped, elongate heater element  is suspended within the chamber , so that the element is in the form of a suspended beam. The printhead as shown is a microelectromechanical system (MEMS) structure, which is formed by a lithographic process which is described in more detail below.","When the printhead is in use, ink  from a reservoir (not shown) enters the chamber  via the inlet passage , so that the chamber fills to the level as shown in . Thereafter, the heater element  is heated for somewhat less than 1 microsecond, so that the heating is in the form of a thermal pulse. It will be appreciated that the heater element  is in thermal contact with the ink  in the chamber  so that when the element is heated, this causes the generation of vapor bubbles  in the ink. Accordingly, the ink  constitutes a bubble forming liquid.  shows the formation of a bubble  approximately 1 microsecond after generation of the thermal pulse, that is, when the bubble has just nucleated on the heater elements . It will be appreciated that, as the heat is applied in the form of a pulse, all the energy necessary to generate the bubble  is to be supplied within that short time.","When the element  is heated as described above, the bubble  forms along the length of the element, this bubble appearing, in the cross-sectional view of , as four bubble portions, one for each of the element portions shown in cross section.","The bubble , once generated, causes an increase in pressure within the chamber , which in turn causes the ejection of a drop  of the ink  through the nozzle . The rim  assists in directing the drop  as it is ejected, so as to minimize the chance of drop misdirection.","The reason that there is only one nozzle  and chamber  per inlet passage  is so that the pressure wave generated within the chamber, on heating of the element  and forming of a bubble , does not affect adjacent chambers and their corresponding nozzles. The pressure wave generated within the chamber creates significant stresses in the chamber wall. Forming the chamber from an amorphous ceramic such as silicon nitride, silicon dioxide (glass) or silicon oxynitride, gives the chamber walls high strength while avoiding the use of material with a crystal structure. Crystalline defects can act as stress concentration points and therefore potential areas of weakness and ultimately failure.",{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0054","num":"0053"},"figref":["FIGS. 2 and 3","FIG. 3"],"b":["1","12","11","3","12","11","12"]},"The increase in pressure within the chamber  not only pushes ink  out through the nozzle , but also pushes some ink back through the inlet passage . However, the inlet passage  is approximately 200 to 300 microns in length, and is only approximately 16 microns in diameter. Hence there is a substantial viscous drag. As a result, the predominant effect of the pressure rise in the chamber  is to force ink out through the nozzle  as an ejected drop , rather than back through the inlet passage .","Turning now to , the printhead is shown at a still further successive stage of operation, in which the ink drop  that is being ejected is shown during its \u201cnecking phase\u201d before the drop breaks off. At this stage, the bubble  has already reached its maximum size and has then begun to collapse towards the point of collapse , as reflected in more detail in .","The collapsing of the bubble  towards the point of collapse  causes some ink  to be drawn from within the nozzle  (from the sides  of the drop), and some to be drawn from the inlet passage , towards the point of collapse. Most of the ink  drawn in this manner is drawn from the nozzle , forming an annular neck  at the base of the drop  prior to its breaking off.","The drop  requires a certain amount of momentum to overcome surface tension forces, in order to break off. As ink  is drawn from the nozzle  by the collapse of the bubble , the diameter of the neck  reduces thereby reducing the amount of total surface tension holding the drop, so that the momentum of the drop as it is ejected out of the nozzle is sufficient to allow the drop to break off.","When the drop  breaks off, cavitation forces are caused as reflected by the arrows , as the bubble  collapses to the point of collapse . It will be noted that there are no solid surfaces in the vicinity of the point of collapse  on which the cavitation can have an effect.","Advantages of Nozzle Enclosures","Referring to , an embodiment of the unit cell  according to the invention is shown. The aperture  is surrounded by a nozzle enclosure , which isolates adjacent apertures on the printhead. The nozzle enclosure  has a roof  and sidewalls , which extend from the roof to the nozzle plate  and form a seal therewith. An opening  is defined in the roof , which allows ink droplets (not shown) to pass through the nozzle enclosure and onto a print medium (not shown).","The nozzle enclosure  minimizes cross-contamination between adjacent apertures  by containing any flooded ink in the immediate vicinity of each nozzle. Flooding of ink from each nozzle may be caused by a variety of reasons, such as nozzle misfires or pressure fluctuations in ink supply channels. The nozzle enclosure may be formed from or coated with a hydrophobic material during the fabrication process, which further minimizes the risk of cross-contamination.","A further advantage of the printhead according to the invention is that it allows the nozzle plate  of the printhead to be wiped without risk of damaging the sensitive nozzle structures. Typically, inkjet printheads are cleaned by a wiping mechanism as part of a warm-up cycle. The nozzle enclosures  provide a protective barrier between the nozzles and the wiping mechanism (not shown).","Fabrication Process","In the interests of brevity, the fabrication stages have been shown for the unit cell of  only (see ). It will be appreciated that the other unit cells will use the same fabrication stages with different masking.","Referring to , there is shown the starting point for fabrication of the thermal inkjet nozzle shown in . CMOS processing of a silicon wafer provides a silicon substrate  having drive circuitry , and an interlayer dielectric (\u201cinterconnect\u201d) . The interconnect  comprises four metal layers, which together form a seal ring for the inlet passage  to be etched through the interconnect. The top metal layer , which forms an upper portion of the seal ring, can be seen in . The metal seal ring prevents ink moisture from seeping into the interconnect  when the inlet passage  is filled with ink.","A passivation layer  is deposited onto the top metal layer  by plasma-enhanced chemical vapour deposition (PECVD). After deposition of the passivation layer , it is etched to define a circular recess, which forms parts of the inlet passage . At the same as etching the recess, a plurality of vias  are also etched, which allow electrical connection through the passivation layer  to the top metal layer . The etch pattern is defined by a layer of patterned photoresist (not shown), which is removed by Oashing after the etch.","Referring to , in the next fabrication sequence, a layer of photoresist is spun onto the passivation later . The photoresist is exposed and developed to define a circular opening. With the patterned photoresist  in place, the dielectric interconnect  is etched as far as the silicon substrate  using a suitable oxide-etching gas chemistry (e.g. O\/CF). Etching through the silicon substrate is continued down to about 20 microns to define a front ink hole , using a suitable silicon-etching gas chemistry (e.g. \u2018Bosch etch\u2019). The same photoresist mask  can be used for both etching steps.  shows the unit cell after etching the front ink hole  and removal of the photoresist .","Referring to , in the next stage of fabrication, the front ink hole  is plugged with photoresist to provide a front plug . At the same time, a layer of photoresist is deposited over the passivation layer . This layer of photoresist is exposed and developed to define a first sacrificial scaffold  over the front plug , and scaffolding tracks  around the perimeter of the unit cell. The first sacrificial scaffold  is used for subsequent deposition of heater material  thereon and is therefore formed with a planar upper surface to avoid any buckling in the heater element (see heater element  in ). The first sacrificial scaffold  is UV cured and hardbaked to prevent reflow of the photoresist during subsequent high-temperature deposition onto its upper surface.","Importantly, the first sacrificial scaffold  has sloped or angled side faces . These angled side faces  are formed by adjusting the focusing in the exposure tool (e.g. stepper) when exposing the photoresist. The sloped side faces  advantageously allow heater material  to be deposited substantially evenly over the first sacrificial scaffold .","Referring to , the next stage of fabrication deposits the heater material  over the first sacrificial scaffold , the passivation layer  and the perimeter scaffolding tracks . The heater material  is typically a monolayer of TiAlN. However, the heater material  may alternatively comprise TiAlN sandwiched between upper and lower passivating materials, such as tantalum or tantalum nitride. Passivating layers on the heater element  minimize corrosion of the and improve heater longevity.","Referring to , the heater material  is subsequently etched down to the first sacrificial scaffold  to define the heater element . At the same time, contact electrodes  are defined on either side of the heater element . The electrodes  are in contact with the top metal layer  and so provide electrical connection between the CMOS and the heater element . The sloped side faces of the first sacrificial scaffold  ensure good electrical connection between the heater element  and the electrodes , since the heater material is deposited with sufficient thickness around the scaffold . Any thin areas of heater material (due to insufficient side face deposition) would increase resistivity and affect heater performance.","Adjacent unit cells are electrically insulated from each other by virtue of grooves etched around the perimeter of each unit cell. The grooves are etched at the same time as defining the heater element .","Referring to , in the subsequent step a second sacrificial scaffold  of photoresist is deposited over the heater material. The second sacrificial scaffold  is exposed and developed to define sidewalls for the cylindrical nozzle chamber and perimeter sidewalls for each unit cell. The second sacrificial scaffold  is also UV cured and hardbaked to prevent any reflow of the photoresist during subsequent high-temperature deposition of the silicon nitride roof material.","Referring to , silicon nitride is deposited onto the second sacrificial scaffold  by plasma enhanced chemical vapour deposition. The silicon nitride forms a roof  over each unit cell, which is the nozzle plate  for a row of nozzles. Chamber sidewalls  and unit cell sidewalls  are also formed by deposition of silicon nitride.","Referring to , the nozzle rim  is etched partially through the roof , by placing a suitably patterned photoresist mask over the roof, etching for a controlled period of time and removing the photoresist by ashing.","Referring to , the nozzle aperture  is etched through the roof  down to the second sacrificial scaffold . Again, the etch is performed by placing a suitably patterned photoresist mask over the roof, etching down to the scaffold  and removing the photoresist mask.","Referring to , in the next stage a third sacrificial scaffold  is deposited over the roof . The third sacrificial scaffold  is exposed and developed to define sidewalls for the cylindrical nozzle enclosure over each aperture . The third sacrificial scaffold  is also UV cured and hardbaked to prevent any reflow of the photoresist during subsequent high-temperature deposition of the nozzle enclosure material.","Referring to , silicon nitride is deposited onto the third sacrificial scaffold  by plasma enhanced chemical vapour deposition. The silicon nitride forms an enclosure roof  over each aperture . Enclosure sidewalls  are also formed by deposition of silicon nitride. Whilst silicon nitride is deposited in the embodiment shown, the enclosure roof  may equally be formed from silicon oxide, silicon oxynitride etc. Optionally, a layer of hydrophobic material (e.g. fluoropolymer) is deposited onto the enclosure roof  after deposition. This extra deposition step may be performed at any stage after deposition (e.g. after etching or after ashing).","Referring to , the nozzle enclosure  is formed by etching through the enclosure roof layer . The enclosure opening  is defined by this etch. In addition, the enclosure roof material which is located outside the enclosure sidewalls  is removed. The etch pattern is defined by standard photoresist masking.","With the nozzle structure, including nozzle enclosure , now fully formed on a frontside of the silicon substrate , an ink supply channel  is etched from the backside of the substrate , which meets with the front plug .","Referring to , after formation of the ink supply channel , the first, second and sacrificial scaffolds of photoresist, together with the front plug  are ashed off using an Oplasma. Accordingly, fluid connection is made from the ink supply channel  through to the nozzle aperture  and the nozzle enclosure opening .","It should be noted that a portion of photoresist, on either side of the nozzle chamber sidewalls , remains encapsulated by the roof , the unit cell sidewalls  and the chamber sidewalls . This portion of photoresist is sealed from the Oashing plasma and, therefore, remains intact after fabrication of the printhead. This encapsulated photoresist advantageously provides additional robustness for the printhead by supporting the nozzle plate . Hence, the printhead has a robust nozzle plate spanning continuously over rows of nozzles, and being supported by solid blocks of hardened photoresist, in addition to support walls.","The invention has been described above with reference to printheads using bubble forming heater elements. However, it is potentially suited to a wide range of printing system including: color and monochrome office printers, short run digital printers, high speed digital printers, offset press supplemental printers, low cost scanning printers high speed pagewidth printers, notebook computers with inbuilt pagewidth printers, portable color and monochrome printers, color and monochrome copiers, color and monochrome facsimile machines, combined printer, facsimile and copying machines, label printers, large format plotters, photograph copiers, printers for digital photographic \u201cminilabs\u201d, video printers, PHOTO CD (PHOTO CD is a registered trade mark of the Eastman Kodak Company) printers, portable printers for PDAs, wallpaper printers, indoor sign printers, billboard printers, fabric printers, camera printers and fault tolerant commercial printer arrays.","It will be appreciated by ordinary workers in this field that numerous variations and\/or modifications may be made to the present invention as shown in the specific embodiments without departing from the spirit or scope of the invention as broadly described. The present embodiments are, therefore, to be considered in all respects to be illustrative and not restrictive.","Ink Jet Technologies","The embodiments of the invention use an ink jet printer type device. Of course many different devices could be used. However presently popular ink jet printing technologies are unlikely to be suitable.","The most significant problem with thermal ink jet is power consumption. This is approximately 100 times that required for high speed, and stems from the energy-inefficient means of drop ejection. This involves the rapid boiling of water to produce a vapor bubble which expels the ink. Water has a very high heat capacity, and must be superheated in thermal ink jet applications. In conventional thermal inkjet printheads, this leads to an efficiency of around 0.02%, from electricity input to drop momentum (and increased surface area) out.","The most significant problem with piezoelectric ink jet is size and cost. Piezoelectric crystals have a very small deflection at reasonable drive voltages, and therefore require a large area for each nozzle. Also, each piezoelectric actuator must be connected to its drive circuit on a separate substrate. This is not a significant problem at the current limit of around 300 nozzles per printhead, but is a major impediment to the fabrication of pagewidth printheads with 19,200 nozzles.","Ideally, the ink jet technologies used meet the stringent requirements of in-camera digital color printing and other high quality, high speed, low cost printing applications. To meet the requirements of digital photography, new ink jet technologies have been created. The target features include:","low power (less than 10 Watts)","high resolution capability (1,600 dpi or more)","photographic quality output","low manufacturing cost","small size (pagewidth times minimum cross section)","high speed (<2 seconds per page).","All of these features can be met or exceeded by the ink jet systems described below with differing levels of difficulty. Forty-five different ink jet technologies have been developed by the Assignee to give a wide range of choices for high volume manufacture. These technologies form part of separate applications assigned to the present Assignee as set out in the table under the heading Cross References to Related Applications.","The ink jet designs shown here are suitable for a wide range of digital printing systems, from battery powered one-time use digital cameras, through to desktop and network printers, and through to commercial printing systems.","For ease of manufacture using standard process equipment, the printhead is designed to be a monolithic 0.5 micron CMOS chip with MEMS post processing. For color photographic applications, the printhead is 100 mm long, with a width which depends upon the ink jet type. The smallest printhead designed is IJ38, which is 0.35 mm wide, giving a chip area of 35 square mm. The printheads each contain 19,200 nozzles plus data and control circuitry.","Ink is supplied to the back of the printhead by injection molded plastic ink channels. The molding requires 50 micron features, which can be created using a lithographically micromachined insert in a standard injection molding tool. Ink flows through holes etched through the wafer to the nozzle chambers fabricated on the front surface of the wafer. The printhead is connected to the camera circuitry by tape automated bonding.","Tables of Drop-on-Demand Ink Jets","Eleven important characteristics of the fundamental operation of individual ink jet nozzles have been identified. These characteristics are largely orthogonal, and so can be elucidated as an eleven dimensional matrix. Most of the eleven axes of this matrix include entries developed by the present assignee.","The following tables form the axes of an eleven dimensional table of ink jet types.","Actuator mechanism (18 types)","Basic operation mode (7 types)","Auxiliary mechanism (8 types)","Actuator amplification or modification method (17 types)","Actuator motion (19 types)","Nozzle refill method (4 types)","Method of restricting back-flow through inlet (10 types)","Nozzle clearing method (9 types)","Nozzle plate construction (9 types)","Drop ejection direction (5 types)","Ink type (7 types)","The complete eleven dimensional table represented by these axes contains 36.9 billion possible configurations of ink jet nozzle. While not all of the possible combinations result in a viable ink jet technology, many million configurations are viable. It is clearly impractical to elucidate all of the possible configurations. Instead, certain ink jet types have been investigated in detail. These are designated IJ01 to IJ45 above which matches the docket numbers in the table under the heading Cross References to Related Applications.","Other ink jet configurations can readily be derived from these forty-five examples by substituting alternative configurations along one or more of the 11 axes. Most of the IJ01 to IJ45 examples can be made into ink jet printheads with characteristics superior to any currently available ink jet technology.","Where there are prior art examples known to the inventor, one or more of these examples are listed in the examples column of the tables below. The IJ01 to IJ45 series are also listed in the examples column. In some cases, print technology may be listed more than once in a table, where it shares characteristics with more than one entry.","Suitable applications for the ink jet technologies include: Home printers, Office network printers, Short run digital printers, Commercial print systems, Fabric printers, Pocket printers, Internet WWW printers, Video printers, Medical imaging, Wide format printers, Notebook PC printers, Fax machines, Industrial printing systems, Photocopiers, Photographic minilabs etc.","The information associated with the aforementioned 11 dimensional matrix are set out in the following tables.",{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0116","num":"0115"},"tables":{"@attributes":{"id":"TABLE-US-00002","num":"00002"},"table":{"@attributes":{"frame":"none","colsep":"0","rowsep":"0","pgwide":"1"},"tgroup":[{"@attributes":{"align":"left","colsep":"0","rowsep":"0","cols":"1"},"colspec":{"@attributes":{"colname":"1","colwidth":"357pt","align":"center"}},"tbody":{"@attributes":{"valign":"top"},"row":[{"entry":{"@attributes":{"namest":"1","nameend":"1","align":"center","rowsep":"1"}}},{"entry":"ACTUATOR MECHANISM (APPLIED ONLY TO SELECTED INK DROPS)"}]}},{"@attributes":{"align":"left","colsep":"0","rowsep":"0","cols":"5"},"colspec":[{"@attributes":{"colname":"offset","colwidth":"42pt","align":"left"}},{"@attributes":{"colname":"1","colwidth":"84pt","align":"left"}},{"@attributes":{"colname":"2","colwidth":"84pt","align":"left"}},{"@attributes":{"colname":"3","colwidth":"63pt","align":"left"}},{"@attributes":{"colname":"4","colwidth":"84pt","align":"left"}}],"tbody":{"@attributes":{"valign":"top"},"row":[{"entry":[{},"Description","Advantages","Disadvantages","Examples"]},{"entry":[{},{"@attributes":{"namest":"offset","nameend":"4","align":"center","rowsep":"1"}}]}]}},{"@attributes":{"align":"left","colsep":"0","rowsep":"0","cols":"5"},"colspec":[{"@attributes":{"colname":"1","colwidth":"42pt","align":"left"}},{"@attributes":{"colname":"2","colwidth":"84pt","align":"left"}},{"@attributes":{"colname":"3","colwidth":"84pt","align":"left"}},{"@attributes":{"colname":"4","colwidth":"63pt","align":"left"}},{"@attributes":{"colname":"5","colwidth":"84pt","align":"left"}}],"tbody":{"@attributes":{"valign":"top"},"row":[{"entry":["Thermal","An electrothermal","Large force","High power","Canon Bubblejet"]},{"entry":["bubble","heater heats the ink to","generated","Ink carrier","1979 Endo et al GB"]},{"entry":[{},"above boiling point,","Simple","limited to water","patent 2,007,162"]},{"entry":[{},"transferring significant","construction","Low efficiency","Xerox heater-in-"]},{"entry":[{},"heat to the aqueous","No moving parts","High","pit 1990 Hawkins et"]},{"entry":[{},"ink.
