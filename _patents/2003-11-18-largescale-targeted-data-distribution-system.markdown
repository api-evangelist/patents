title: Large-scale targeted data distribution system
abstract: A method, system, computer system and computer program product to distribute data to arbitrarily large subsets of a very large client base, with each client computer system running client software referred to as an agent. The data distribution system uses minimal server resources and a large-scale network such as the Internet. The data to be distributed may include, for example, agent software configuration data; agent software programs, plug-ins, and associated data; announcements; and other data that is centrally managed by an administrator. Using this invention, millions of client computer systems, such as computer systems for subscribers to a broadband service, can be configured and managed centrally, while allowing data to be distributed to all or a subset of subscribers efficiently and using minimal bandwidth. Agents assist in determining whether particular data are to be distributed to them, enabling much larger-scale applications to be supported with limited server-side resources.

Field of the Invention","This invention relates to communication between clients and servers in a large-scale distributed client\/server system.","2. Description of the Related Art","Computer component manufacturers, software developers, and Internet service providers (\u201cISPs\u201d) continue to develop technology that increases the speed of Internet communication. The emergence of broadband technology, including DSL (digital subscriber lines), ISDN (integrated services digital network), and other broadband communication schemes are due in large part to this common goal. Many software developers are now re-designing existing software to take advantage of new Internet technologies.","User computers must be configured to access broadband Internet communication. Typically, a special modem must be configured, appropriate drivers installed, accounts established and other steps taken to implement the communication link. Moreover, because computer systems are very seldom sold ready for broadband communication, configuration often requires a service person to visit the physical location of the computer to configure it for access to a broadband network.","Rather than send service personnel, broadband service providers have begun to provide client software to be installed on subscribers' computer systems. This client software, also referred to herein as an agent, enables a user to configure access to broadband services automatically, i.e., without the need for a service person to be onsite. The agent solution works well for basic modem installation and configuration. However, the agent must be updated so that the computers, in which the agent is installed, can take advantage of changes to broadband services offered. Accordingly, a need exists to centrally manage and automatically update these agents or other application programs on each of the subscribers' computer systems.","Central management of agents can be performed by a server in communication with client computer systems that contain the agent. One problem in achieving such central management is that at Internet scales, it is impractical for the server to maintain persistent connections to a very large number of clients. Also, in the modern networking world, firewalls, Port Address Translators, Network Address Translators, and the like make it impractical for a server to contact its clients. Furthermore, a large scale deployment of intermittently connected clients requires synchronization of software and configuration information for each client when that client establishes a connection with the server.","A model has been used where the clients periodically poll one or more servers. Servers process each request as it is received, but individually providing a response to each of millions of clients requires significant server hardware and a significant database investment, in addition to the costs of personnel to maintain such a large system.","Broadcasting technology enables servers to broadcast messages to a very large number of clients. However, the bandwidth requirement to send messages to millions of clients can severely degrade network performance. It is desirable to have the capability to provide a message or set of data to an arbitrarily large subset of clients without degrading network performance.","To achieve Internet scales, it may be necessary to provide multiple, equivalent servers to share the load. Clients should see the group of servers as a single source. A large group of servers presents management challenges to server administrators. Common server software and system state information should be efficiently maintained and communicated to all servers, while preserving the clients' unified view.","Furthermore, many large-scale client\/server applications require configuration data on the client to correctly operate. This configuration data may evolve as the network environment and business needs change. It is desirable to proactively deliver configuration data to distributed clients by a central administrator as configuration data evolves. In addition, the capability should exist for administrators to post information to the users of broadband networks. Mechanisms exist that rely on user action, but it is desirable that an administrator be able to proactively post generally applicable information onto users' desktops in a large-scale deployment of client computers.","A solution is needed that allows data to be distributed to a very large client base using minimal server resources. The solution should be scalable, efficient, and capable of using a publicly available network, such as the Internet, for distributing data.","The present invention is used to distribute data to arbitrarily large subsets of a very large client base, with most or each client computer system of the client base running client software referred to as an agent. The data distribution system uses a large-scale network such as the Internet. The data to be distributed may include, for example, agent software configuration data; agent software programs, plug-ins, and associated data; announcements; and other data that is centrally managed by an administrator. Using this invention, millions of client computer systems, such as computer systems for subscribers to a broadband service, can be configured or managed centrally, while allowing data to be distributed to all or a subset of subscribers efficiently and using minimal bandwidth. Agents may assist in determining whether particular data are to be distributed to them, enabling much larger-scale applications to be supported with limited server-side resources.","The use of the same reference symbols in different drawings indicates similar or identical items.","For a thorough understanding of the subject invention, refer to the following Detailed Description, including the appended Claims, in connection with the above-described Drawings.","References in the specification to \u201cone embodiment\u201d or \u201can embodiment\u201d mean that a particular feature, structure, or characteristic described in connection with the embodiment is included in at least one embodiment of the invention.

Each of the server computer systems , , and in server group  has a processor (not shown) and a memory (not shown) in which software components can run. In one embodiment, each server computer system in server group  provides substantially identical functionality and includes substantially identical components. Examples of these components are shown within server and are described in further detail below.","In the embodiment shown, server group  represents a server farm or cluster, where server computer systems , , and share a hostname and other resources. The location of particular data is provided as a Uniform Resource Locator (URL) accessible in server group , and any one of servers , , and can provide that particular data to an agent requesting it. This embodiment enables load balancing to manage a very large number of agents with as few servers as possible in server group . In one embodiment, data to be distributed are stored as static web pages in web page storage .","Client computer system  communicates with one of server computer systems , , or in server group  via a communication link, such as communication link  between client computer system  and server . In one embodiment, communication link  is implemented via an Internet connection.","Administrative computer system  hosts administrative interface , which uses web browser . Administrative interface  can be used, for example, to provide data for indirect distribution to agents, such as agent , in data distribution system . Typically, data to be communicated are provided in the form of a data file or a message. Administrative computer system  can also communicate with one or more of server computer systems , , and in server group  via a communication link, such as the communication link  between administrative computer system  and server . Communication link  can be implemented, for example, as an intranet, as a connection to a local area network for servers , , and in server group , as an Internet connection, or in other ways known to those skilled in the art.","In the embodiment illustrated, each of the server computer systems in server group  has access to shared resources, such as database  and event queue . These shared resources are used to communicate data between server computer systems in server group . The data communicated between server computer systems may include data to be distributed to agents (e.g., agent ) and\/or other servers. One of skill in the art will readily understand that information can be made commonly available to servers in a client\/server system using shared resources implemented in a variety of ways. The present invention is not limited to use of a database or an event queue, as long as data for distribution can be made commonly available to a group of servers in a client\/server system.","Server provides an example embodiment of a server operating in data distribution system . Server includes server component S (also designated as Agent Configuration Service server component S), server component S (also designated as an Agent Update Service server component S), server component S (also designated as an Announcement Service server component S), and server component S (also designated as an Administrative Service server component S). Server also includes a Data Publishing Service S used for communicating between servers in server group . Data Publishing Service S includes a publisher component P and a listener component L.","Server also includes a web server . In one embodiment, Administrative Service server component  provides a web-based application that uses web server  to serve web pages from web page storage . One of skill in the art will understand that a single web server may provide server components for multiple services, such as S, S, S, and S. In addition, web server  may reside on a different server computer system than server , and the servers in server group  may use the same or different web servers. Furthermore, web page storage  need not reside on server itself, but may reside on a separate storage device accessible by server ","Each of the server components S, S, and S has a respective client component on client computer system . These client components include, respectively, Agent Configuration Service client component C, Agent Update Service client component C, and Announcement Service client component C. Each service is described in further detail below. One of ordinary skill in the art will recognize that these are three examples of services for distributing respective types of data, and that services distributing other types of data are also within the scope of the invention.","Referring again to client computer system , in one embodiment, agent communication module  acts as a container including instructions implementing each of the service client components C, C, and C. Agent communication module  also includes filter engine , which processes data as explained in further detail below.","In one embodiment, agent communication module  is implemented as a process that runs on a client computer system hosting an agent, even when the respective agent is not active. The service client components within agent communication module  are examples of service client components, but agent communication module  may include other service client components for distributing different types of data.","Each of these service client components C, C, and C provides code to implement service-specific functionality. In one embodiment, this code is provided in the form of an application programming interface (API). Agent  is configured to periodically request respective service-specific data stored at a pre-specified location in server group , as well as to request respective service-specific data upon starting.","The operation of the Agent Configuration Service is described in further detail below as an example of distributing one type of data in data distribution system .","Agent Configuration Service","Client application programs, such as agent , use configuration data describing how to perform their duties. For example, configuration data, stored in the Windows Registry by most software applications running in the Windows operating system, controls the application's behavior with regard to visual display or user preferences. Broadband applications may also use configuration data to control how they manage, monitor, and use the broadband network.

In action ., agent  is started. In action ., agent  calls a function provided by Agent Configuration Service client component C to check for updated configuration data. In one embodiment, agent communication module  calls a function provided by an application programming interface (API) represented by Agent Configuration Service client component C, which was provided by the service provider with software for agent .","In action ., the function call to Agent Configuration Service client component C calls web server  requesting a pre-determined web page to check for configuration data. Each service within agent communication module  has a specific, pre-determined web page to request. For Agent Configuration Service client component C, this pre-determined web page is a static web page at the location of index file  in web page storage .","In one embodiment, the pre-determined web page is obtained by examining an entry for the Agent Configuration Service in a Service Point Map. The Service Point Map entry for the Agent Configuration Service points to a Uniform Resource Locator (URL), in this case a URL for index file , managed by the Agent Configuration Service. Service Point Maps are described in further detail in the \u201cService Point Map\u201d section of the \u201cBroadband Service Control Network\u201d patent application and in the \u201cDistributed Services Architecture through use of a Dynamic Service Point Map\u201d patent application described in the \u201cCross-References to Related Applications\u201d section of this document.","In one embodiment, a request for the index file is implemented using an HTTP get-if-modified-since command. Web server  is configured to ensure that index file  and data file  are located at pre-specified locations. If index file  has not been updated, index file  is not transmitted across connection , thereby saving bandwidth.","Index file  is requested first, rather than data file , to minimize the amount of data transferred across the network. If each of millions of client computer systems were to request a copy of data file , transfers of large data files would likely overwhelm the network. However, index file , an example of which is shown in , is typically much smaller than data file . Requesting index file  and processing it on client computer system  to determine whether data file  should be requested provides significant bandwidth savings and much greater scalability of data distribution system .","In the embodiment using the HTTP get-if-modified-since command, if index file  has been updated after a specified time, this update indicates that the respective data file  to be distributed has changed since that time. In action ., index file  is retrieved from web page storage . In action ., web server  then provides index file  to the requesting Agent Configuration Service client component C. Index file  is considered to be updated both when index file  is first created and when index file  is modified.","When the requesting service client component, such as one of service client components C, C, and C, receives index file , the index file is processed to determine whether to request data file . In the embodiment shown in , the index file is processed by filter engine . In action ., index file  is made available to filter engine . Processing index file  by filter engine  determines whether agent  meets filtering criteria specified in index file  and, if so, determines that data file  should be requested. The structure of an index file is illustrated in  and described below, followed by further discussion of processing the index file by the filter engine.",{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0062","num":"0061"},"figref":"FIG. 6","b":["102","610","610","620","620","620","610","630","100","610","630","640","640"]},"Each of configuration criterion A and B provides a respective filter criterion A or B to describe specific properties of agents to which the corresponding data apply. Finally, each of configuration criterion A and B provides the respective data file location A or B for the corresponding data file. Only agents that have the specific properties described by the respective filter criterion A or B should request the corresponding data file at location A or B.","Returning to , in action ., filter engine  processes data of the index file to determine whether data file  should be downloaded to client computer . In one embodiment, filter engine  processes the index file to determine if agent  satisfies the filtering criteria for one configuration in the index file. If filter  determines that agent  satisfies the filtering criteria for one configuration in the index file, then filter  generates a positive result indicating that data file  should be requested and subsequently downloaded to client . This positive result is provided to Agent Configuration Service client component C. The result may also include the location (e.g., data file location A) of data file . If filter engine  determines that agent  does not meet the filtering criteria for one configuration in index file , a negative result is returned to Agent Configuration Service client component C.","In one embodiment, a configuration name, such as configuration name , and a configuration version number, such as version number 644, uniquely identify a configuration in the index file. Other types of services also have identifiers delimiting respective information for data to be distributed. For configuration data, filter engine  searches for configurations that have not been processed. When a new configuration is encountered, filter engine  examines the filter criterion for the configuration to determine whether the configuration data are applicable to the corresponding agent . The filter describes a set of criteria that the agent  and\/or hosting client computer system  should satisfy to download the corresponding configuration data. Filter engine  compares the filter criteria to a set of data about the agent  and\/or client computer . This set of agent data can be maintained locally on the client computer system  and\/or on server in a Profile for the agent (as described in the \u201cProfile\u201d section of the \u201cBroadband Service Control Network\u201d application described in the \u201cCross References to Related Applications\u201d section of this document).","Referring back to , assume that filter engine  indicates that agent  meets filtering criteria specified in index file  and should obtain data file  from web page storage .

In this case, a pointer to an entry point to Agent Configuration Services server component S for acknowledgements is obtained from the Service Point Map described above. The acknowledgement message may include a receipt code indicating success or failure of the receipt of data file . The corresponding Agent Configuration Service server component S archives the receipt code in database , using a technique described in the \u201cProfile\u201d section of the \u201cBroadband Service Control Network\u201d patent application described in the \u201cCross-References to Related Applications\u201d section of this document. Receipt codes can be used to identify agents that have successfully received data file  and\/or agents that encountered a problem with data file .

Upon receipt of the executable program, Agent Update Service client component C causes the executable program to be run, resulting in new or replacement software and\/or data being installed on the client computer system . Typically, agent communication module  obtains the user's permission to run the executable program via a graphical user interface (GUI). The text for the permission request presented by this GUI can be retrieved independently from the server. Permission requests can be customized for a particular agent profile. For example, an agent running on a computer system in Texas can be targeted to receive an English message, whereas an agent running on a computer system in France can present a message in French. The text to be presented in the permission request can be distributed as a separate text file in the same manner that index file  and data file  are distributed, as described in .","Executable programs can replace agent software, or they can update an individual component (or \u201cplug-in\u201d) of the software for agent , as described in patent application Ser.

The Announcement Service allows an administrator to produce a text message and provide the message to a set of the client computer systems running agents. Announcement Service S differs from an e-mail service in that e-mail is targeted at specific users, either directly using the users' email addresses or indirectly using mailing lists. The Announcement Service allows an administrator to target users based on characteristics of their client computer system and\/or broadband service account, rather than requiring the administrator to identify the mailing address for each user to receive the announcement. For example, recipients of announcements can be based upon the location of the user as identified in the agent profile, rather than requiring the administrator to identify all users' e-mail addresses at that location.","At the receiving client computer system, the announcement can be provided to the user via a user interface provided by the agent. Typically, an indicator changes in the context of the agent, indicating that a new message is available. The user can then view the message from the agent. Announcements can contain formatted text, graphics, and hyperlinks.","In one embodiment, delivery of an announcement to a given client computer system may be delayed until an appropriate time. A process continuously runs on the client computer system and watches for incoming announcements. If an announcement is detected, the process can either launch the targeted agent or save the announcement for the next time the agent is started. In one embodiment, this choice is configurable by an administrator for the agent.","Targeting and distribution of an Announcement is handled using an index file, a filter engine, and the Data Publishing Service, in a manner similar to that described for the Agent Configuration Service in .","The foregoing describes an embodiment wherein some components are contained within other components (e.g., web browser  of Administrative Interface  in ).
