title: Compliance testing communication protocols implemented on resource-constrained computing devices
abstract: One embodiment of the present invention provides a system that supports compatibility testing of functionality provided through an Application Programming Interface (API) on a computing device. During operation, the system loads a client testing module on the computing device. The system also loads a remote testing module on a server. Once the client testing module and the remote testing module have been loaded, the system identifies a communication protocol that is available between the computing device and the server, and configures a communication-protocol-specific portion of the client testing module to communicate with the remote testing module through the available communication protocol. The system then compatibility tests the functionality provided through the API on the computing device. During this compatibility testing, certain portions of the test execute within the client testing module while other portions of the test execute within the remote testing module. Hence, the client testing module and the remote testing module work together in a distributed manner to compatibility test the computing device.

{"@attributes":{"id":"description"},"BRFSUM":[{},{}],"heading":["BACKGROUND","SUMMARY","DETAILED DESCRIPTION"],"p":["1. Field of the Invention","The present invention relates to techniques for testing computing devices. More specifically, the present invention relates to a method and apparatus for compliance testing communication protocols supported on resource-constrained computing devices.","2. Related Art","The explosive growth of the Internet has fueled the demand for Internet-connected devices such as PDAs and cell phones. Initially, these devices were simple; they could send and receive simple text messages, as well as browse special text-only web sites. Over the years, these devices have become much more complex and are able to perform tasks that once required a much larger desktop computer. Many of these devices on the market today support numerous protocols and have built-in platform-independent virtual machines which allow them to run numerous platform-independent applications.","As these devices become more complex and support an ever increasing number of protocols, compliance testing becomes increasingly more important to ensure that the protocols supported by the device adhere to standardized protocol specifications. Note that applications that perform compliance testing need to be sufficiently large to test the functionality implemented on the device. Unfortunately, these devices typically provide only limited computing resources for running such compliance testing applications. Cell phones, for example, typically have small screens, small amounts of memory, limited processor power, and in many cases, limited communication bandwidth. More often than not, the resources available on the computing device are insufficient to perform a complete compliance test.","What is needed is a method and an apparatus for compliance testing computing devices without the problems mentioned above.","One embodiment of the present invention provides a system that supports compatibility testing of functionality provided through an Application Programming Interface (API) on a computing device. During operation, the system loads a client testing module on the computing device. The system also loads a remote testing module on a server. Once the client testing module and the remote testing module have been loaded, the system identifies a communication protocol that is available between the computing device and the server, and configures a communication-protocol-specific portion of the client testing module to communicate with the remote testing module through the available communication protocol. The system then compatibility tests the functionality provided through the API on the computing device. During this compatibility testing, certain portions of the test execute within the client testing module while other portions of the test execute within the remote testing module. Hence, the client testing module and the remote testing module work together in a distributed manner to compatibility test the computing device.","In a variation on this embodiment, as the tests are completed, the system exchanges information between the client testing module and the remote testing module and assembles the results of the tests.","In a variation on this embodiment, the system configures a communication-protocol-specific portion of the remote testing module to communicate with the client testing module through the available communication protocol.","In a variation on this embodiment, the client testing module is run within a platform-independent virtual machine within the computing device.","In a variation on this embodiment, the remote testing module is run within a platform-independent virtual machine within the server.","In a variation on this embodiment, the compatibility testing is initiated at the server.","In a variation on this embodiment, the compatibility testing is initiated at the computing device.","In a variation on this embodiment, the results of the compatibility tests are sent to the server and are displayed on the server.","In a variation on this embodiment, the results of the compatibility tests are displayed on the computing device.","In a variation on this embodiment, the computing device receives one or more tests from the server during the compatibility testing process.","The following description is presented to enable any person skilled in the art to make and use the invention, and is provided in the context of a particular application and its requirements. Various modifications to the disclosed embodiments will be readily apparent to those skilled in the art, and the general principles defined herein may be applied to other embodiments and applications without departing from the spirit and scope of the present invention. Thus, the present invention is not intended to be limited to the embodiments shown, but is to be accorded the widest scope consistent with the principles and features disclosed herein.","The data structures and code described in this detailed description are typically stored on a computer readable storage medium, which may be any device or medium that can store code and\/or data for use by a computer system. This includes, but is not limited to, magnetic and optical storage devices such as disk drives, magnetic tape, CDs (compact discs) and DVDs (digital versatile discs or digital video discs), and computer instruction signals embodied in a transmission medium (with or without a carrier wave upon which the signals are modulated). For example, the transmission medium may include a communications network, such as the Internet.","Computer Network",{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0023","num":"0022"},"figref":"FIG. 1","b":["102","104","100","100","100","102","104"]},"Compliance Testing a Computing Device",{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0024","num":"0023"},"figref":["FIG. 2","FIG. 2"],"b":["104","102","200","206","200","202","210","214","104","201","208","201","204","212","216"]},"API for protocol access  is coupled to API under test  via protocol under test . Additionally, interface implementation  is coupled to interface implementation  via control channel . Control channel  includes message server , which abstracts the implementation of control channel , which makes it easier to facilitate message exchanges through control channel  using any reliable communication channel.","In one embodiment of the present invention, API for protocol access  is implemented as a \u201cplugin\u201d on server . This allows the underlying transport mechanism of the protocol under test  to be abstracted.","During operation, remote testing module  communicates with client testing module  via control channel . This allows remote testing module  to work with client testing module  in a distributed fashion, wherein remote testing module  executes portions of a test and sends commands to client testing module  to perform specified operations on computing device . In one embodiment of the present invention, most of the processing is performed within remote testing module , which sends requests through control channel  to client testing module . In another embodiment, most of the processing is performed within client testing module , which sends requests through control channel  to remote testing module .","In one embodiment of the present invention, control channel  is implemented using the \u201chttp\u201d protocol, which is commonly supported on resource-constrained computing devices.","Interfaces  contains simple methods that allow the exchange of information between server  and computing device . In one embodiment of the present invention, interfaces  contains a \u201csend\u201d method, which has a message argument and an argument that specifies a test or a set of instructions to send, and a \u201creceive\u201d method which has no arguments. The send method allows server  to send a test or an instruction to computing device  along with a message. The receive method allows server  to receive a message and\/or a component from computing device .

In one embodiment of the present invention, a test is loaded onto computing device  via a storage medium such as a flash card. In another embodiment, server  makes tests available to computing device  (step ) via control channel . Once a communication link via control channel  has been established, the tests are executed on both remote testing module  and client testing module  (step ). In one embodiment of the present invention, tests are run on remote testing module  and client testing module  in a distributed manner where remote testing module  sends commands to client testing module .","During testing, remote testing module  and client testing module  exchange information via control channel  as necessary (step ), and each module determines its outcome independently (step ). Once testing is complete, server  assembles the results of the testing (step ). Optionally, the results can be displayed on computing device , saved to storage medium, or sent to a third party.","Compliance testing can encompass any functionality provided by computing device . In the example shown in , API under test  can be tested to verify that it adheres to protocol under test . This can be accomplished by sending test messages between computing device  and server  through API under test . At the same time client testing module  and remote testing module  continue to communicate with each other through control channel  because API under test  yet guaranteed to be operating properly.","Note that this distributed approach to testing facilitates a more complete testing of the communication process because test messages can be sent both from computing device  to server , and from server  to computing device  through protocol under test . During this testing process, the implementation of the communication protocol on computing device  can be tested against a stable implementation of the communication protocol on server .","Note that client testing module  and remote testing module  can also be used to verify that JVM  on computing device  adheres to the JAVA VIRTUAL MACHINE standard.","The foregoing descriptions of embodiments of the present invention have been presented for purposes of illustration and description only. They are not intended to be exhaustive or to limit the present invention to the forms disclosed. Accordingly, many modifications and variations will be apparent to practitioners skilled in the art.
