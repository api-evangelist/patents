Thus, for every machining operations, it is a general practice to set a typical parameter by which an affect is offered to some extent. Further, with a special purpose machine tool specifically structured for performing a specific machining operation, it is a usual practice for a specific tuning to be implemented so as to meet such a particular machining operation each time the special purpose machine tool is manufactured and delivered.","However, the numerical control device is complicated in function in a recently developed machine tool that requires to be operated at a high speed and at a high accuracy, with a resultant difficulty arising for a user to understand which function is utilized to perform a desired machining operation.","In addition, the servo tuning value and the corrected value have optimum values different from one another depending on machining conditions, resulting in an issue in which the parameter tunings, typically conducted up to now, are unable to cover a range under which the machining condition is optimum for entire machining operations.","The present invention has been completed with a view to addressing the issues as set forth above and has an object to provide a numerical control device which enables optimum parameters, such as a servo gain, a velocity limit value and a corrected value for a reversed rotation of an axis, to be easily set in dependence on a variety of machining operations while, at the same time, enabling tuning of the optimum parameters to be easily executed in dependence on the various machining operations on the basis of an evaluation of machined results.","To achieve the above object, according to a first aspect of the present invention, a numerical control device comprises a memory section that stores discrete optimum parameters suitable for operational modes, respectively, an operational mode setting section that allows a particular operational mode to be set through a user's operation, wherein a particular parameter, suited for the particular operational mode selected and set with the operational mode setting section, is retrieved from the memory section to allow setting of the particular parameter to be executed.","With the numerical control device of such a structure, the operational modes are set for various machining operations such as a kind of machining operations, respectively. Selecting the operational modes allows the optimum parameter suited for the selected operational mode to be executed.","According to a second aspect of the present invention, the discrete optimum parameters for the respective operational modes include servo parameters for respective control axes and, in addition, the optimum parameter includes a corrected value for a reversed rotation of an axis, a velocity limit value and an acceleration limit value, etc.","According to a third aspect of the present invention, the numerical control device further comprises a defect content setting unit permitting a defect content of a machined result to be set through the user's operation, wherein a parameter, correlated with occurrence of the defect content that is set with the defect content setting unit, is retrieved from the memory section in accordance with a preset rule to permit the retrieved parameter to be updated.","With the numerical control device according to the third aspect of the present invention, it is possible for the optimum parameter to be set in dependence on the various machining operations on the basis of an evaluation of machined results.","According to a fourth aspect of the present invention, the numerical control device further comprises a machining history memory section that stores a parameter set value appearing when executing a machining program and information related to a machined result for each machining program which is executed.","With the numerical control device according to the fourth aspect mentioned above, referring to information stored in the machining history memory section may also set the optimum parameter.","An embodiment of the present invention is described below in detail with reference to the accompanying drawings.",{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0040","num":"0039"},"figref":"FIG. 1"},"The numerical control device  is configured to have a structure in a computer type that includes a CPU , a memory unit , a NC device section , a PLC (programmable logic controller) control section , an input\/output control section , a bus  that mutually interconnects these components with respect to one another, and an operation panel  that serves as a machine interface section.","The memory unit  is comprised of re-writable memories such as RAMs. The memory unit  has memory areas allocated with a program memory section A that stores machining programs, a parameter memory section B that stores an optimum parameter discretely provided for each operational mode, and a machining history memory section C, that stores a parameter set value for executing the machine program and information correlated with a machined result for each of the machine programs which are executed.","The operation panel  has a cycle start button , a cycle stop button , a keyboard , operational mode selector switches , and a display , such as a CRT, LCD, etc. A user is able to execute various settings on an inactive basis.","Connected to the NC control section  is a feed drive servo motor amplifier  that performs control of electric power to be applied to a servo motor . The PLC control section  is connected to a spindle motor control amplifier  that performs control of electric power to be applied to a spindle motor , and a peripheral unit control section  that controls operations of peripheral units , such as a coolant supply unit, etc.","The input\/output control section  is connected to a CCD camera  that pickups an image of a workpiece who's machining is terminated.","The operational mode selector switches  of the operation panel  serve as operational mode selecting and setting means through which operational modes are selectively set responsive to user's operations. The CPU  is operative to read out the optimum parameter, suitable for the operational mode selected with the operational mode selection switches , from the parameter memory section B to allow the read out optimum parameter to be automatically set for the NC control section , the feed drive servo motor amplifier  and the spindle motor control amplifier .","The operational modes include the following items of which one operational mode is set through the user's operation with the use of the operational mode selection switches .
