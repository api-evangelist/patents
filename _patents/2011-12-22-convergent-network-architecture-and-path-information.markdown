title: Convergent network architecture and path information
abstract: Convergent network architecture and path information. Within a convergent network composed of different respective networks, each respective network may be controlled or managed internally and independently with respect to the other networks. For example, each respective network includes a forwarding and link metrics database and is managed by its own respective control entity (e.g., which may be any one of the given devices were nodes within that network). Generally speaking, each respective network may be modeled as an Ethernet bridge such that each respective bridge natively maintains its own forwarding and link metrics database. Such link metrics are specific to a given network and may cover one or both of prioritized Quality of Service (QoS) and parameterized QoS. Relays between neighboring bridges may effectively propagate and/or forward their respective databases, and update of any given database may be made asynchronously or based on a neighboring bridge query.

Technical Field of the Invention","The invention relates generally to communication systems; and, more particularly, it relates to convergent networks composed of any number of different respective network types.","2. Description of Related Art","Data communication systems have been under continual development for many years. One particular type of communication system is particularly related to heterogeneous networking technologies which may be implemented in accordance with home networking technologies. For example, within certain such network environments, as few as one or two or more different types of different respective network technologies may be implemented in accordance with a common abstract layer for supporting communications among such different network technologies.","As an example, different types of networks that may be implemented within such a heterogeneous networking technology environment may be varied. In addition, while it is noted that such different types of networks may be implemented within such a heterogeneous networking technology environment, the present art does not provide a means by which different respective networks may operate effectively and seamlessly with respect to another. For example, within any one respective network, there may be multiple respective communication links therein. Moreover, different respective networks may interface with respect to one another at more than one node or point.","The prior art fails to provide for effective operation of such heterogeneous networking technologies in regards to a number of issues including considerations such as network management, neighbor discovery, topology discovery, path selection, network control and management. While research and development continues in attempts to address these and other deficiencies within such convergent networks employing heterogeneous technologies, the prior art does not adequately provide acceptable solutions to allow for high levels of performance and broad implementation of such convergent networks.","Within communication systems, signals are transmitted between various communication devices therein. The goal of digital communications systems is to transmit digital data from one location, or subsystem, to another either error free or with an acceptably low error rate. As shown in , data may be transmitted over a variety of communications channels in a wide variety of communication systems: magnetic media, wired, wireless, fiber, copper, and other types of media as well.",{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0033","num":"0037"},"figref":["FIG. 1","FIG. 2","FIG. 3","FIG. 4"],"b":["100","200","300","400"]},"Referring to , this embodiment of a communication system  is a communication channel  that communicatively couples a communication device  (including a transmitter  having an encoder  and including a receiver  having a decoder ) situated at one end of the communication channel  to another communication device  (including a transmitter  having an encoder  and including a receiver  having a decoder ) at the other end of the communication channel . In some embodiments, either of the communication devices  and  may only include a transmitter or a receiver. There are several different types of media by which the communication channel  may be implemented (e.g., a satellite communication channel  using satellite dishes  and , a wireless communication channel  using towers  and  and\/or local antennae  and , a wired communication channel , and\/or a fiber-optic communication channel  using electrical to optical (E\/O) interface  and optical to electrical (O\/E) interface )). In addition, more than one type of media may be implemented and interfaced together thereby forming the communication channel .","To reduce transmission errors that may undesirably be incurred within a communication system, error correction and channel coding schemes are often employed. Generally, these error correction and channel coding schemes involve the use of an encoder at the transmitter end of the communication channel  and a decoder at the receiver end of the communication channel .","Any of various types of ECC codes described can be employed within any such desired communication system (e.g., including those variations described with respect to ), any information storage device (e.g., hard disk drives (HDDs), network information storage devices and\/or servers, etc.) or any application in which information encoding and\/or decoding is desired.","Generally speaking, when considering a communication system in which video data is communicated from one location, or subsystem, to another, video data encoding may generally be viewed as being performed at a transmitting end of the communication channel , and video data decoding may generally be viewed as being performed at a receiving end of the communication channel .","Also, while the embodiment of this diagram shows bi-directional communication being capable between the communication devices  and , it is of course noted that, in some embodiments, the communication device  may include only video data encoding capability, and the communication device  may include only video decoding capability, or vice versa (e.g., in a uni-directional communication embodiment such as in accordance with a video broadcast embodiment).","Referring to the communication system  of , at a transmitting end of a communication channel , information bits  (e.g., corresponding particularly to video data in one embodiment) are provided to a transmitter  that is operable to perform encoding of these information bits  using an encoder and symbol mapper  (which may be viewed as being distinct elements as shown in the diagram, namely, encoder  and symbol mapper  such that the encoder  generates encoded information bits  that get provided to the symbol mapper ) thereby generating a sequence of discrete-valued modulation symbols  that is provided to a transmit driver  that uses a DAC (Digital to Analog Converter)  to generate a continuous-time transmit signal  and a transmit filter  to generate a filtered, continuous-time transmit signal  that substantially comports with the communication channel . At a receiving end of the communication channel , continuous-time receive signal  is provided to an AFE (Analog Front End)  that includes a receive filter  (that generates a filtered, continuous-time receive signal ) and an ADC (Analog to Digital Converter)  (that generates discrete-time receive signals ). A metric generator  calculates metrics  (e.g., on either a symbol and\/or bit basis) that are employed by a decoder  to make best estimates of the discrete-valued modulation symbols and information bits encoded therein .","Within each of the transmitter  and the receiver , any desired integration of various components, blocks, functional blocks, circuitries, etc. Therein may be implemented. For example, this diagram shows a processing module as including the encoder and symbol mapper  and all associated, corresponding components therein, and a processing module  is shown as including the metric generator  and the decoder  and all associated, corresponding components therein. Such processing modules and may be respective integrated circuits. Of course, other boundaries and groupings may alternatively be performed without departing from the scope and spirit of the invention. For example, all components within the transmitter  may be included within a first processing module or integrated circuit, and all components within the receiver  may be included within a second processing module or integrated circuit. Alternatively, any other combination of components within each of the transmitter  and the receiver  may be made in other embodiments.","As with the previous embodiment, such a communication system  may be employed for the communication of video data is communicated from one location, or subsystem, to another (e.g., from transmitter  to the receiver  via the communication channel ).","Referring to the embodiment  of , such a communication system may generally be viewed as including multiple networks that can interface with each other. Generally speaking, such an embodiment  can include a network 1, a network 2, a network 3, and so on up to a network n (e.g., where n is an integer). Such an overall communication system, composed of multiple networks, can generally be referred to as a convergent network (e.g., in which multiple networks are converged with one another thereby generating or forming a larger communication system, namely, a convergent network).","To interface communications between the respective networks, certain interfaces (e.g., relays) may be implemented within certain communication devices that are operative to communication with at least two of the types of network. In some embodiments, a given communication device may include functionality to interface with more than two networks (e.g., 3 networks, 4, networks, etc.). As may be seen in the diagram, an interface by which communications are made between two of the networks is via a network interface (or relay). As some specific examples, communications made between network 1 and network 2 are made via network 1\/2 interface (or relay); communications made between network 1 and network 3 are made via network 1\/3 interface (or relay); communications made between network n and network x are made via network n\/x interface (or relay); and so on.","Generally speaking, for a communication device to support communications with more than one network will typically result in greater functionality and\/or complexity of such a communication device. In some embodiments, a given communication device includes functionality to interface with and support communications with, at most, two of the networks within the overall communication system or convergent network.","Of course, some of the communication devices therein only include functionality to interface with and support communications with one of the networks within the overall communication system or convergent network. When such a communication device (e.g., one including functionality to interface with and support communications with one of the networks) communicates with another communication device including functionality to interface with and support communications with another one of the networks, such communications are made via at least one interface (or relay) by which communications are made from one network to another.","The types of networks that the networks 1 to n may represent may be varied. For examples, such networks may be wired networks, wireless network, optical networks, cellular networks, satellite networks, power line based networks, etc. Of course, certain of these networks may not only operate in accordance with different types of media (e.g., wired, wireless [air], optical, etc.), but certain of these networks may operate in accordance with different communication standards, protocols, and\/or recommended practices.","Referring to the embodiment  of , such a communication system is a convergent network including interfacing and supporting of communications between various types of communication networks. This diagram particularly depicts a wireless local area network (WLAN\/WiFi), a multimedia over coax alliance (MoCA\u00ae, or generally referred to as MoCA) network, a local area network (LAN) such as one that operates in accordance with Ethernet or in accordance with IEEE 802.3, a HomePlug network (e.g., a communication network operating in accordance with various power line communication standards, protocols, and\/or recommended practices and can operate using power system related hardware and infrastructure), and\/or a wireless point to point (P2P) system (shown as Wireless P2P in the diagram).","Various communication devices are operative to support communications with more than one of these various network types within the overall communication system or convergent network. Such communication devices may generally be referred to as relays that perform the appropriate conversion, transcoding, interfacing, etc. of signals received from and compliant with a first type of network in accordance with generating signals compliant with a second type of network; such a relay then forwards the newly generated signal via the second type of network. It is also noted that such relay functionality may be included within any desired communication device within the convergent network. While certain relays may be dedicated relays within the convergent network, any such type of communication device within the convergent network may include such relaying or interfacing functionality therein.","Of course, certain communications may be transmitted across multiple network interfaces and, as such, may undergo appropriate processing in accordance with more than one relay (e.g., from a first type of network to a second type of network, then from the second type of network to a third second type of network, etc.).","In certain communication devices that includes such relaying or interfacing functionality therein, a P1905.1 Layer may be implemented above the respective media access control (MAC) layers corresponding to two or more network types. For example, a P1905.1 Layer may be implemented above a first MAC layer corresponding to a WLAN and also above a second MAC layer corresponding to a MoCA network. Alternatively, a P1905.1 Layer may be implemented above a first MAC layer corresponding to a LAN or Ethernet network and also above a second MAC layer corresponding to a HomePlug network. Generally, for a relay device, such a P1905.1 Layer may be implemented above at least two MAC layers corresponding respectively to at least two types of networks within the convergent network. Of course, for a terminal device (e.g., one not implemented to effectuate relaying of frames between two or more interfaces), such a P1905.1 Layer may be implemented over a single MAC layer corresponding to one of the types of networks within the convergent network. In some embodiments, such a terminal device may also be implemented using a P1905.1 layer to allow the device to be seen as a P1905.1 device and to be controlled by the P1905.1 network management entity in accordance with a P1905.1 control protocol (e.g., so that the device will not be seen as a legacy device in the convergent network).","Herein, a novel architecture for is presented for use in convergent networks. It is noted that such architecture may be broadly applied to a variety of types of network in which various types of communication systems and\/or communication networks may be interacting with one another (e.g., such as in accordance with a convergent home network (CHN)). Of course, such functionality may be broadly and generally applied to any types of communication systems and\/or communication networks that interact with one another, including any such combination of the various types of communication systems, communication networks, such as with respect to . Also, the media employed for the various communication links and\/or communication channels within such convergent networks may be varied including any one and\/or any combination of the various types depicted with reference to .","In accordance with one embodiment, a convergent network may be managed as a bridged local area network (LAN) in which each respective communication system and\/or communication network type is modeled generally as an Ethernet bridge. For example, instead of handling a convergent network as a flat mesh network, the convergent network may be managed as a bridged LAN, and each respective sub-network therein may be modeled as a respective Ethernet bridge.","In accordance with such an architecture, information related to path information and propagation of such information through the overall convergent network may be made for use in path selection among the various paths that may be available within the overall convergent network. For example, a mechanism is presented or defined to propagate the P1905.1 path information required for path selection between various nodes and\/or bridges in the convergent network.","In one embodiment, this involves propagating the P1905.1 path information between neighboring bridges only, and this path selection propagating P1905.1 path metric information within the bridges through bridge specific transports. For example, in accordance with a convergent network (e.g., a convergent home network (CHN)), the architecture and functionality herein provides for a means to look at each node as a respective bridge and instead of creating a mesh architecture there among (which can be difficult to manage), a bridged LAN architecture is employed so that each respective sub-network therein may be modeled as a respective Ethernet bridge. Also, with this novel architecture and modeling, path selection is greatly facilitated and made more efficient.",{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0055","num":"0059"},"figref":"FIG. 5","b":"500"},"In one embodiment, a unique (per P1905.1 network) 48_bit MAC address is allocated to the P1905.1 AL. As may be seen in the diagram, the hatched portion indicates the P1905 abstraction layer, which interfaces with a link layer control (LLC) layer.","Generally speaking, this is operative to create a virtual MAC, which is operative to control the convergence layer, so that the communication device looks like a single device to the upper layer(s). In addition, in accordance with such metrics as may be collected, selection of either the MAC_n or MAC_m may be made.",{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0058","num":"0062"},"figref":"FIG. 6","b":"600"},{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0059","num":"0063"},"figref":"FIG. 7","b":"700"},{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0060","num":"0064"},"figref":"FIG. 8","b":"800"},"Also, these respective MAC_i SAPs interface communicate with a number of respective PHY_i's (e.g., generally shown as PHY_n through PHY_m, which may include as few as one or as many as any desired integer number of PHYs as shown on the right hand side associated with the data plane, and the number of PHY_i's including a same number of MAC_i's) via a number of respective PHY_i SAPs (Service Access Points). The respective PHY_i's may communicate with any of a number of other devices via one or more communication networks.","With respect to the control and\/or management plane, a P1905.1 Abstraction Layer Management Entity (ALME) interfaces with the underlying MAC\/PHY Service Management Entities (SMEs) as shown on the left hand side associated with the control or management plane.",{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0063","num":"0067"},"figref":"FIG. 9","b":"900"},{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0064","num":"0068"},"figref":["FIG. 10","FIG. 4"],"b":"1000"},{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0065","num":"0069"},"figref":"FIG. 11","b":"1100"},{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0066","num":"0070"},"figref":"FIG. 12","b":"1200"},"Each respective DB is operative to perform the handling and control\/management (e.g., address learning, aging, updating as needed, etc.) are specific to the bridge (including distributed bridges).

Therefore, with respect to each respective communication link by which communication may be effectuated between a first node and a second (e.g., perhaps via multiple communication links or hops), and each respective communication link has a corresponding and respective metric.","By using not only path information, but also the associated metric information associated with each respective communication link within the overall convergent network, it may be learned how to reach each respective node within the overall convergent network using the one or more metrics associated therewith, and the addresses as well as metrics may be passed to assist in decision making regarding which path to employ between two different nodes within the overall convergent network.","As may be understood, the metrics associated with the propagation of a bridge is therefore internal to the bridge (e.g., not outside of the respective bridge). Also, information between the bridges is only propagated through respective relays (e.g., a relay being a port connected to bridge to another port connected to another bridge). As the reader may understand, this allows for an architecture and model of such a convergent network not in accordance with a mesh pattern.",{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0072","num":"0076"},"figref":"FIG. 14","b":"1400"},"As may be seen, such respective information may get forwarded via multiple hops across the communication network and across multiple bridges.",{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0074","num":"0078"},"figref":"FIG. 15","b":"1500"},"Such updating may be performed at the neighboring bridge rate. Also, such forwarding that is operative to effectuate internal change to a bridge does not necessarily trigger a DB update to the neighboring bridge if the one or more changes do not affect the external routing (e.g., such as with respect to relaying, link metric increase, etc.).",{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0076","num":"0080"},"figref":"FIG. 16","b":"1600"},"With respect to the relative ranking\/use of metrics herein, a higher metric is relatively worse, and a lower metric is relatively better (e.g., a metric of 7 is worse than a metric of 4, etc.).","As may be seen, the metric associated with the communication link from P2 to P3 degrades from 4 to 7. As such, relaying of communications from P2 to P3 may be effectuated via P4 (e.g., the 2 respective metrics associated with these two communication links are 3 and 1 for a total of 4 [metric of 3 from P2 to P4, and metric of 1 from P4 to P3]). This path (in accordance with relaying via P4) is therefore better\/more desirable than the direct communication link path between P2 to P3 as may be seen with respect to their respective metrics.","Also, it is noted that such updating may be performed non-synchronously, in that, the update of the DB may be performed internally only to the relevant distributed bridge (e.g., need only update the change with respect to that internal DB). Of course, alternative embodiments may provide such update information external to the bridge for use by other bridges. However, it may be understood that such updating may be only internally the relevant distributed bridge in a preferred embodiment.",{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0080","num":"0084"},"figref":"FIG. 17","b":"1700"},"With respect to the throughput availability of such an embodiment, the throughput availability could be based on a variety of parameters including one or both of (1) PRI QoS (priority QoS [e.g., such as that a packet has an associated priority, such as data vs. voice, and the functionality can forward the packet immediately, or via a certain path, etc.]) based on traffic statistics, transmit and\/or receive counters, bit rate, and (2) pQoS (parameterized QoS such as in accordance with bandwidth reservation (e.g., in which a particular bandwidth is reserved and cannot be employed by any other devices)).","Also, a variety of types of metrics may be employed in various embodiments including:\n\n","On a P1905.1 relay, the MAC addresses are both the MACs addresses bridged locally, if any, and the MAC addresses bridged by the neighboring bridge.

Also, such PATH DB relaying may be performed via a \u2018round robin\u2019 manner between bounded MACs, that is preempt-able by the upper layers in case of (PATH_INFO) indication.","Alternatively, in another embodiment, if a \u2018round robin\u2019 mode of operation is not desired in a given application, then such relaying can be performed immediately (e.g., the \u2018round robin\u2019 order can be pre-empted).",{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0086","num":"0093"},"figref":"FIG. 18","b":"1800"},"In some embodiments, such functionality does not modify the underlying MAC protocol.

As may still further be used herein, the term \u201cassociated with\u201d, includes direct and\/or indirect coupling of separate items and\/or one item being embedded within another item. As may be used herein, the term \u201ccompares favorably\u201d, indicates that a comparison between two or more items, signals, etc., provides a desired relationship. For example, when the desired relationship is that signal  has a greater magnitude than signal , a favorable comparison may be achieved when the magnitude of signal  is greater than that of signal  or when the magnitude of signal  is less than that of signal .","As may also be used herein, the terms \u201cprocessing module\u201d, \u201cmodule\u201d, \u201cprocessing circuit\u201d, and\/or \u201cprocessing unit\u201d (e.g., including various modules and\/or circuitries such as may be operative, implemented, and\/or for encoding, for decoding, for baseband processing, etc.) may be a single processing device or a plurality of processing devices. Such a processing device may be a microprocessor, micro-controller, digital signal processor, microcomputer, central processing unit, field programmable gate array, programmable logic device, state machine, logic circuitry, analog circuitry, digital circuitry, and\/or any device that manipulates signals (analog and\/or digital) based on hard coding of the circuitry and\/or operational instructions. The processing module, module, processing circuit, and\/or processing unit may have an associated memory and\/or an integrated memory element, which may be a single memory device, a plurality of memory devices, and\/or embedded circuitry of the processing module, module, processing circuit, and\/or processing unit. Such a memory device may be a read-only memory (ROM), random access memory (RAM), volatile memory, non-volatile memory, static memory, dynamic memory, flash memory, cache memory, and\/or any device that stores digital information. Note that if the processing module, module, processing circuit, and\/or processing unit includes more than one processing device, the processing devices may be centrally located (e.g., directly coupled together via a wired and\/or wireless bus structure) or may be distributedly located (e.g., cloud computing via indirect coupling via a local area network and\/or a wide area network). Further note that if the processing module, module, processing circuit, and\/or processing unit implements one or more of its functions via a state machine, analog circuitry, digital circuitry, and\/or logic circuitry, the memory and\/or memory element storing the corresponding operational instructions may be embedded within, or external to, the circuitry comprising the state machine, analog circuitry, digital circuitry, and\/or logic circuitry. Still further note that, the memory element may store, and the processing module, module, processing circuit, and\/or processing unit executes, hard coded and\/or operational instructions corresponding to at least some of the steps and\/or functions illustrated in one or more of the Figures. Such a memory device or memory element can be included in an article of manufacture.","The present invention has been described above with the aid of method steps illustrating the performance of specified functions and relationships thereof. The boundaries and sequence of these functional building blocks and method steps have been arbitrarily defined herein for convenience of description. Alternate boundaries and sequences can be defined so long as the specified functions and relationships are appropriately performed. Any such alternate boundaries or sequences are thus within the scope and spirit of the claimed invention. Further, the boundaries of these functional building blocks have been arbitrarily defined for convenience of description. Alternate boundaries could be defined as long as the certain significant functions are appropriately performed. Similarly, flow diagram blocks may also have been arbitrarily defined herein to illustrate certain significant functionality. To the extent used, the flow diagram block boundaries and sequence could have been defined otherwise and still perform the certain significant functionality. Such alternate definitions of both functional building blocks and flow diagram blocks and sequences are thus within the scope and spirit of the claimed invention. One of average skill in the art will also recognize that the functional building blocks, and other illustrative blocks, modules and components herein, can be implemented as illustrated or by discrete components, application specific integrated circuits, processors executing appropriate software and the like or any combination thereof.","The present invention may have also been described, at least in part, in terms of one or more embodiments. An embodiment of the present invention is used herein to illustrate the present invention, an aspect thereof, a feature thereof, a concept thereof, and\/or an example thereof. A physical embodiment of an apparatus, an article of manufacture, a machine, and\/or of a process that embodies the present invention may include one or more of the aspects, features, concepts, examples, etc. described with reference to one or more of the embodiments discussed herein. Further, from figure to figure, the embodiments may incorporate the same or similarly named functions, steps, modules, etc. that may use the same or different reference numbers and, as such, the functions, steps, modules, etc. may be the same or similar functions, steps, modules, etc. or different ones.","Unless specifically stated to the contra, signals to, from, and\/or between elements in a figure of any of the figures presented herein may be analog or digital, continuous time or discrete time, and single-ended or differential. For instance, if a signal path is shown as a single-ended path, it also represents a differential signal path. Similarly, if a signal path is shown as a differential path, it also represents a single-ended signal path. While one or more particular architectures are described herein, other architectures can likewise be implemented that use one or more data buses not expressly shown, direct connectivity between elements, and\/or indirect coupling between other elements as recognized by one of average skill in the art.","The term \u201cmodule\u201d is used in the description of the various embodiments of the present invention. A module includes a functional block that is implemented via hardware to perform one or module functions such as the processing of one or more input signals to produce one or more output signals. The hardware that implements the module may itself operate in conjunction software, and\/or firmware. As used herein, a module may contain one or more sub-modules that themselves are modules.","While particular combinations of various functions and features of the present invention have been expressly described herein, other combinations of these features and functions are likewise possible. The present invention is not limited by the particular examples disclosed herein and expressly incorporates these other combinations."],"BRFSUM":[{},{}],"brief-description-of-drawings":[{},{}],"description-of-drawings":{"heading":"BRIEF DESCRIPTION OF THE SEVERAL VIEWS OF THE DRAWINGS","p":[{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0014","num":"0018"},"figref":["FIG. 1","FIG. 2","FIG. 3","FIG. 4"]},{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0015","num":"0019"},"figref":"FIG. 5"},{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0016","num":"0020"},"figref":"FIG. 6"},{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0017","num":"0021"},"figref":"FIG. 7"},{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0018","num":"0022"},"figref":"FIG. 8"},{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0019","num":"0023"},"figref":"FIG. 9"},{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0020","num":"0024"},"figref":"FIG. 10"},{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0021","num":"0025"},"figref":"FIG. 11"},{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0022","num":"0026"},"figref":"FIG. 12"},{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0023","num":"0027"},"figref":"FIG. 13"},{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0024","num":"0028"},"figref":"FIG. 14"},{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0025","num":"0029"},"figref":"FIG. 15"},{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0026","num":"0030"},"figref":"FIG. 16"},{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0027","num":"0031"},"figref":"FIG. 17"},{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0028","num":"0032"},"figref":"FIG. 18"},{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0029","num":"0033"},"figref":"FIG. 19"},{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0030","num":"0034"},"figref":"FIG. 20"},{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0031","num":"0035"},"figref":["FIG. 21A","FIG. 21B"]}]},"DETDESC":[{},{}]}
