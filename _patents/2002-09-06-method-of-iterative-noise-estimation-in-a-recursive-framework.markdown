title: Method of iterative noise estimation in a recursive framework
abstract: A method and apparatus estimate additive noise in a noisy signal using an iterative technique within a recursive framework. In particular, the noisy signal is divided into frames and the noise in each frame is determined based on the noise in another frame and the noise determined in a previous iteration for the current frame. In one particular embodiment, the noise found in a previous iteration for a frame is used to define an expansion point for a Taylor series approximation that is used to estimate the noise in the current frame. In one embodiment, noise estimation employs a recursive-Expectation-Maximization framework with a maximum likelihood (ML) criteria. In a further embodiment, noise estimation employs a recursive-Expectation-Maximization framework based on a MAP (maximum a posterior) criteria.

{"@attributes":{"id":"description"},"RELAPP":[{},{}],"heading":["CROSS REFERENCE TO RELATED APPLICATIONS","BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION","SUMMARY OF THE INVENTION","DETAILED DESCRIPTION OF ILLUSTRATIVE EMBODIMENTS"],"p":["This application is a continuation-in-part of application Ser. No. 10\/116,792, filed Apr. 5, 2002, now U.S. Pat. No. 6,644,590 the priority of which is hereby claimed.","The present invention relates to noise estimation. In particular, the present invention relates to estimating noise in signals used in pattern recognition.","A pattern recognition system, such as a speech recognition system, takes an input signal and attempts to decode the signal to find a pattern represented by the signal. For example, in a speech recognition system, a speech signal (often referred to as a test signal) is received by the recognition system and is decoded to identify a string of words represented by the speech signal.","Input signals are typically corrupted by some form of noise. To improve the performance of the pattern recognition system, it is often desirable to estimate the noise in the noisy signal.","In the past, two general frameworks have been used to estimate the noise in a signal. In one framework, batch algorithms are used that estimate the noise in each frame of the input signal independent of the noise found in other frames in the signal. The individual noise estimates are then averaged together to form a consensus noise value for all of the frames. In the second framework, a recursive algorithm is used that estimates the noise in the current frame based on noise estimates for one or more previous or successive frames. Such recursive techniques allow for the noise to change slowly over time.","In one recursive technique, a noisy signal is assumed to be a non-linear function of a clean signal and a noise signal. To aid in computation, this non-linear function is often approximated by a truncated Taylor series expansion, which is calculated about some expansion point. In general, the Taylor series expansion provides its best estimates of the function at the expansion point. Thus, the Taylor series approximation is only as good as the selection of the expansion point. Under the prior art, however, the expansion point for the Taylor series was not optimized for each frame. As a result, the noise estimate produced by the recursive algorithms has been less than ideal.","In light of this, a noise estimation technique is needed that is more effective at estimating noise in pattern signals.","A method and apparatus estimate additive noise in a noisy signal using an iterative technique within a recursive framework. In particular, the noisy signal is divided into frames and the noise in each frame is determined based on the noise in another frame and the noise determined in a previous iteration for the current frame. In one particular embodiment, the noise found in a previous iteration for a frame is used to define an expansion point for a Taylor series approximation that is used to estimate the noise in the current frame.","In one embodiment, noise estimation employs a recursive-Expectation-Maximization framework with a maximum likelihood (ML) criteria. In a further embodiment, noise estimation employs a recursive-Expectation-Maximization framework based on a MAP (maximum a posterior) criteria. The noise estimate utilizing MAP criteria uses and improves upon the ML criteria by including prior information based on portions of a pattern signal that contains only noise, for example, portions preceding and\/or following a portion with observation data. The prior information constrains the maximum likelihood auxiliary function by providing, in effect, a range in which the noise should fall within.",{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0017","num":"0016"},"figref":"FIG. 1","b":["100","100","100","100"]},"The invention is operational with numerous other general purpose or special purpose computing system environments or configurations.

In a further embodiment, noise estimation can be based on a MAP (maximum a posterior) criteria. In the embodiment illustrated, this algorithm is based on the maximum likelihood (ML) criteria as discussed above within the recursive-Expectation-Maximization framework.","The recursive-Expectation-Maximization framework includes an Expectation step and a Maximization step.

From the terms contained therein, the prior information does not contain any data, i.e., observations y, but rather, as based only on noise. In contrast, the auxiliary function Q(n) is based both on observations yand noise n. The prior information constrains Q(n) by providing, in effect, a range in which the noise should fall within. The variance scaling factor \u03c1 weights the prior information relative to the ML auxiliary function Q(n).","The prior information, and in particular, p(n) is obtained from non-speech portions of an utterance. Referring to , a given pattern signal , herein by example an utterance, may have a preceding portion  and a following portion  that have no speech contained therein, and therefore, comprise only noise. In , portion  represents speech data. The prior information can be based on one or both of the portions  and . The prior information is made Gaussian by taking the mean and the variance. For example, in one embodiment, the portions used to compute the prior information can be identified by a level detector, which identifies corresponding portions as speech data if a level or energy content is exceeded, while those portions that do not exceed the selected level or energy content can be identified and used to calculate the prior information. However, it should be noted that calculation of the prior information is not limited to those portions immediately adjacent the speech portion  for a given utterance .","Referring back to equation 20, the maximum likelihood (ML) auxiliary function Q(n) can be expressed as the following conditional expectation:",{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0066","num":"0065"},"maths":{"@attributes":{"id":"MATH-US-00010","num":"00010"},"math":{"@attributes":{"overflow":"scroll"},"mtable":{"mtr":{"mtd":[{"mtable":{"mtr":[{"mtd":{"mrow":{"mrow":[{"msub":{"mi":["Q","ML"]},"mo":"\u2061","mrow":{"mo":["(",")"],"msub":{"mi":["n","t"]}}},{"mi":"E","mo":"\u2061","mrow":{"mo":["[","]"],"mrow":{"mrow":{"mi":"log","mo":["\u2062","\u2062","\u2062"],"mstyle":{"mspace":{"@attributes":{"width":"0.3em","height":"0.3ex"}}},"mrow":{"mi":"p","mo":["(","\uf604"],"mrow":{"msubsup":{"mi":["y","t"],"mn":"1"},"mo":",","mrow":{"msubsup":{"mi":["M","t"],"mn":"1"},"mo":"\u2062","mrow":{"mo":["\uf603",")"],"msub":{"mi":["n","t"]}}}}},"msubsup":{"mi":["y","t"],"mn":"1"}},"mo":",","msubsup":{"mi":"n","mn":"1","mrow":{"mi":"t","mo":"-","mn":"1"}}}}}],"mo":["=","\u2062"],"mi":{}}}},{"mtd":{"mrow":{"mo":["=","\u2062"],"mi":{},"mrow":{"munderover":{"mo":"\u2211","mrow":{"mi":"\u03c4","mo":"=","mn":"1"},"mi":"l"},"mo":["\u2062","\u2062"],"mstyle":{"mspace":{"@attributes":{"width":"0.3em","height":"0.3ex"}}},"mrow":{"munderover":{"mo":"\u2211","mrow":{"mi":"m","mo":"=","mn":"1"},"mi":"M"},"mo":["\u2062","\u2062"],"mstyle":{"mspace":{"@attributes":{"width":"0.3em","height":"0.3ex"}}},"mrow":{"mrow":[{"msub":{"mi":["\u03be","\u03c4"]},"mo":"\u2061","mrow":{"mo":["(",")"],"mi":"m"}},{"mi":"p","mo":"(","mrow":{"mrow":{"msub":{"mi":["y","\u03c4"]},"mo":"\u2062","mrow":{"mo":["\uf603",")"],"mrow":{"mi":"m","mo":",","msub":{"mi":["n","t"]}}}},"mo":","}}],"mo":["\u2062","\u2062","\u2062"],"mi":"log","mstyle":{"mspace":{"@attributes":{"width":"0.3em","height":"0.3ex"}}}}}}}}}]}},{"mrow":{"mi":"EQ","mo":[".","\u2062"],"mstyle":{"mspace":{"@attributes":{"width":"0.6em","height":"0.6ex"}}},"mn":"22"}}]}}}},"br":{}},{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0067","num":"0066"},"maths":{"@attributes":{"id":"MATH-US-00011","num":"00011"},"math":{"@attributes":{"overflow":"scroll"},"mtable":{"mtr":{"mtd":[{"mtable":{"mtr":[{"mtd":{"mrow":{"msub":{"mi":"Q","mrow":{"mi":"ML","mo":"\u2061","mrow":{"mo":["(",")"],"msub":{"mi":["n","t"]}}}},"mo":["\u2248","\u2062"],"mi":{},"mrow":{"munderover":{"mo":"\u2211","mrow":{"mi":"\u03c4","mo":"=","mn":"1"},"mi":"t"},"mo":"\u2062","mrow":{"msup":{"mi":"\u03b5","mrow":{"mi":["t","\u03c4"],"mo":"-"}},"mo":["\u2062","\u2062"],"mstyle":{"mspace":{"@attributes":{"width":"0.3em","height":"0.3ex"}}},"mrow":{"munderover":{"mo":"\u2211","mrow":{"mi":"m","mo":"=","mn":"1"},"mi":"M"},"mo":"\u2062","mrow":{"mrow":[{"msub":{"mi":["\u03be","\u03c4"]},"mo":"\u2061","mrow":{"mo":["(",")"],"mi":"m"}},{"mi":"p","mo":"\u2061","mrow":{"mo":["(",")"],"mrow":{"mrow":{"msub":{"mi":["y","\u03c4"]},"mo":"|","mi":"m"},"mo":",","msub":{"mi":["n","t"]}}}}],"mo":["\u2062","\u2062","\u2062","\u2062"],"mstyle":[{"mspace":{"@attributes":{"width":"0.3em","height":"0.3ex"}}},{"mspace":{"@attributes":{"width":"0.3em","height":"0.3ex"}}}],"mi":"log"}}}}}}},{"mtd":{"mrow":{"mo":["=","\u2062"],"mi":{},"mrow":{"mrow":[{"mo":"-","mrow":{"munderover":{"mo":"\u2211","mrow":{"mi":"\u03c4","mo":"=","mn":"1"},"mi":"t"},"mo":"\u2062","mrow":{"msup":{"mi":"\u03b5","mrow":{"mi":["t","\u03c4"],"mo":"-"}},"mo":"\u2062","mrow":{"munderover":{"mo":"\u2211","mrow":{"mi":"m","mo":"=","mn":"1"},"mi":"M"},"mo":"\u2062","mrow":{"mrow":{"msub":{"mi":["\u03be","\u03c4"]},"mo":"\u2061","mrow":{"mo":["(",")"],"mi":"m"}},"mo":["\u2062","\u2062"],"mstyle":{"mspace":{"@attributes":{"width":"0.3em","height":"0.3ex"}}},"mfrac":{"msup":{"mrow":{"mo":["(",")"],"mrow":{"msub":{"mi":["y","\u03c4"]},"mo":"-","msubsup":{"mi":["\u03bc","m","y"]}}},"mn":"2"},"mrow":{"mn":"2","mo":["\u2062","\u2062"],"mstyle":{"mspace":{"@attributes":{"width":"0.6em","height":"0.6ex"}}},"msubsup":{"mi":["\u03a3","m","y"]}}}}}}}},{"mi":"Const","mo":"."}],"mo":"+"}}}}]}},{"mrow":{"mi":"EQ","mo":[".","\u2062"],"mstyle":{"mspace":{"@attributes":{"width":"0.8em","height":"0.8ex"}}},"mn":"23"}}]}}}}},"The forgetting factor \u03b5 controls the balance between the ability of the algorithm to track noise non-stationary and the reliability of the noise estimate, Mis the sequence of the speech model's mixture components up to frame t, and \u03be(m)=p(m|y,n) is the posterior probability.","It should be noted that the exponential decay of the forgetting factor \u03b5 herein illustrated is but one distribution for forgetting (i.e. weighting) factors that can be used.

The invention may also be used more directly as part of a noise reduction system in which the estimated noise identified for each frame is removed from the noisy signal to produce a clean signal such as described in patent application entitled NON-LINEAR OBSERVATION MODEL FOR REMOVING NOISE FROM CORRUPTED SIGNALS, application Ser. No. 10\/237,163, filed on even date herewith.",{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0082","num":"0081"},"figref":["FIG. 6","FIG. 6"]},"In , a speaker , either a trainer or a user, speaks into a microphone . Microphone  also receives additive noise from one or more noise sources . The audio signals detected by microphone  are converted into electrical signals that are provided to analog-to-digital converter .","Although additive noise  is shown entering through microphone  in the embodiment of , in other embodiments, additive noise  may be added to the input speech signal as a digital signal after A-to-D converter .","A-to-D converter  converts the analog signal from microphone  into a series of digital values. In several embodiments, A-to-D converter  samples the analog signal at 16 kHz and 16 bits per sample, thereby creating 32 kilobytes of speech data per second. These digital values are provided to a frame constructor , which, in one embodiment, groups the values into 25 millisecond frames that start 10 milliseconds apart.","The frames of data created by frame constructor  are provided to feature extractor , which extracts a feature from each frame. Examples of feature extraction modules include modules for performing Linear Predictive Coding (LPC), LPC derived cepstrum, Perceptive Linear Prediction (PLP), Auditory model feature extraction, and Mel-Frequency Cepstrum Coefficients (MFCC) feature extraction. Note that the invention is not limited to these feature extraction modules and that other modules may be used within the context of the present invention.","The feature extraction module produces a stream of feature vectors that are each associated with a frame of the speech signal. This stream of feature vectors is provided to noise reduction module , which uses the noise estimation technique of the present invention to estimate the noise in each frame.","The output of noise reduction module  is a series of \u201cclean\u201d feature vectors. If the input signal is a training signal, this series of \u201cclean\u201d feature vectors is provided to a trainer , which uses the \u201cclean\u201d feature vectors and a training text  to train an acoustic model . Techniques for training such models are known in the art and a description of them is not required for an understanding of the present invention.","If the input signal is a test signal, the \u201cclean\u201d feature vectors are provided to a decoder , which identifies a most likely sequence of words based on the stream of feature vectors, a lexicon , a language model , and the acoustic model . The particular method used for decoding is not important to the present invention and any of several known methods for decodeing may be used.","The most probable sequence of hypothesis words is provided to a confidence measure module . Confidence measure module  identifies which words are most likely to have been improperly identified by the speech recognizer, based in part on a secondary acoustic model (not shown). Confidence measure module  then provides the sequence of hypothesis words to an output module  along with identifiers indicating which words may have been impoperly identified. Those skilled in the art will recognize that confidence measure module  is not necessary for the practice of the present invention.","Although  depicts a speech recognition system, the present invention may be used in any pattern recognition system and is not limited to speech.","Although the present invention has been described with reference to particular embodiments, workers skilled in the art will recognize that changes may be made in form and detail without departing from the spirit and scope of the invention."],"BRFSUM":[{},{}],"brief-description-of-drawings":[{},{}],"description-of-drawings":{"heading":"BRIEF DESCRIPTION OF THE DRAWINGS","p":[{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0011","num":"0010"},"figref":"FIG. 1"},{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0012","num":"0011"},"figref":"FIG. 2"},{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0013","num":"0012"},"figref":"FIG. 3"},{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0014","num":"0013"},"figref":"FIG. 4"},{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0015","num":"0014"},"figref":"FIG. 5"},{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0016","num":"0015"},"figref":"FIG. 6"}]},"DETDESC":[{},{}]}
