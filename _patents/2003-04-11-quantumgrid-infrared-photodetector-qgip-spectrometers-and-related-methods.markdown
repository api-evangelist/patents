title: Quantum-grid infrared photodetector (QGIP) spectrometers and related methods
abstract: A plurality of quantum-grid infrared photodetector (QGIP) elements are concatenated to form a spectrometer. Each of the QGIP elements is adapted to detect light at a particular range of wavelengths. Additionally, each QGIP element is adapted to produce a photocurrent that is proportional to the amount of light detected at its respective range of wavelengths. This type of configuration permits spectrometry within a spectrum that spans the aggregate ranges of wavelengths of each QGIP element.

{"@attributes":{"id":"description"},"GOVINT":[{},{}],"heading":["GOVERNMENT INTEREST","TECHNICAL FIELD","DESCRIPTION OF RELATED ART","SUMMARY","DETAILED DESCRIPTION"],"p":["The invention described herein may be manufactured, used, and licensed by or for the United States Government.","The present disclosure relates generally to spectrometry and, more particularly, to infrared spectrometry.","Spectrometers are commonly used to characterize or identify chemicals and biological specimens in laboratories. Spectrometers are also used to characterized semiconductor materials and optical materials.","Many conventional spectrometers, such as Fourier Transform (FT) infrared (IR) spectrometers, are expensive, bulky, and fragile. Often, optical elements such as diffraction gratings or prisms are used in conventional spectrometers to separate incident light into its various wavelength components. For many conventional spectrometers, a source generates light across the spectrum of interest and a monochromater (e.g., diffraction grating or prism) separates the source radiation into its various wavelengths. A slit selects a collection of wavelengths that shine through a sample at any given time. The sample absorbs light according to its chemical properties, and a detector collects the radiation that passes through the sample. The detector outputs an electrical signal, which is normally sent directly to an analog recorder, thereby allowing recordation of energy as a function of frequency or wavelength.","For such spectrometers, the use of optical elements often results in optical attenuation, thereby reducing system sensitivity. Given these deficiencies in conventional spectrometers, it is desirable to have alternatives. For example, it is desirable to have spectrometers that are comparatively inexpensive, portable, and robust.","The present disclosure provides spectrometers and related methods.","Briefly described, an embodiment of a spectrometer comprises a plurality of quantum-grid infrared photodetector (QGIP) elements. Each QGIP element is adapted to detect energy at a particular range of wavelengths and generate a photocurrent that is proportional to the energy detected at that particular range of wavelengths.","An embodiment of a method comprises the steps of detecting energy at a plurality of quantum-grid infrared photodetector (QGIP) elements and generating photocurrents in response to the detected energy. The detected energy is defined by a plurality of wavelengths that, in the aggregate, form a substantially continuous spectrum. Each photocurrent is proportional to the detected energy at one range of wavelengths.","Other systems, methods, features and\/or advantages will be or may become apparent to one with skill in the art upon examination of the following drawings and detailed description. It is intended that all such additional systems, methods, features and\/or advantages be included within this description.","Quantum-grid infrared photodetector (QGIP) elements are relatively small and inexpensive devices that can be configured to detect energy at various wavelengths. QGIP elements typically detect light at a particular wavelength (or particular range of wavelengths) due to their inherent light-scattering properties. The properties of QGIP elements are discussed in detail in U.S. Pat. No. 5,485,015, which is incorporated herein by reference as if set forth in its entirety. Thus, only a truncated discussion of the properties of QGIP elements is provided here. For reasons discussed below, the characteristics of QGIP elements can permit construction of fairly cost-effective, portable, and robust spectrometers. Consequently, a spectroscopy system that employs a spectrometer having QGIP elements in robust and compact due to advantageous features provided by the QGIP elements.","Reference is now made in detail to the description of the embodiments as illustrated in the drawings. While several embodiments are described in connection with these drawings, there is no intent to limit the invention to embodiments disclosed herein. On the contrary, the intent is to cover all alternatives, modifications, and\/or equivalents.",{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0026","num":"0025"},"figref":["FIG. 1A","FIG. 1A"],"b":["10","100","10","102","104","106","100","100","102","104","108","106"]},"As is shown in , the displayed spectrum  depicts a distribution of detected wavelengths.

Thus, the QGIP spectrometer  of  may be fabricated within a very compact area. The incident light detected by each QGIP element  is introduced through the substrate . In other words, the incident light propagates through the substrate  prior to detection. Therefore, at least a portion of the substrate  is optically transparent with respect to the range of wavelengths that are to be detected. Hence, during fabrication, the metal layer  is deposited around the array of QGIP elements  so that the incident light is unobstructed when entering the QGIP elements  through the substrate . Photocurrents from each QGIP element  are independently measured by current amplifiers (not shown), which reside in the amplifier circuit .","Since the ten QGIP elements  detect energy at ten different ranges of wavelengths for the QGIP spectrometer  of , ten sets of photocurrents are generated, each of which is proportional to the energy at one of the ten different ranges of wavelengths. If the ten different ranges of wavelengths are relatively close to each other, then the aggregate of the wavelengths forms a substantially continuous spectrum. Consequently, measurement of the photocurrents generated by the QGIP elements  results in a spectroscopic measurement of the incident light. The compact nature of the QGIP spectrometer  provides a very compact and portable spectroscopy system for performing spectroscopic measurements.",{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0031","num":"0030"},"figref":["FIG. 2A","FIG. 1B","FIG. 2A"],"b":["110","100","110","200","200","205","210","215","220","225","215"]},"Each QGIP element  comprises a grid pattern of metal that is first deposited on top of a quantum-well infrared photodetector (QWIP) material. Since QWIP materials are discussed in detail in U.S. Pat. Nos. 5,485,015 and Re 34,649, which are incorporated herein by reference as if set forth in their entireties, only a truncated discussion of QWIP material is presented here. The grid pattern of metal serves as the top metal layer  and also as a mask for etching (e.g., plasma etching, etc.). The QWIP material has a number of layers that constitute a superlattice active region. Using the mask, the QWIP material is etched vertically through the superlattice active region and down into a portion of the bottom contact layer. The etching process results in a number of gridlines  having superlattices . An unetched portion  resides on one side of the QGIP element  for the purpose of wire bonding. Another layer of metal  is deposited on the bottom contact layer surrounding the QGIP element . As described above, this layer of metal  is deposited around the QGIP elements  to provide unobstructed access of incident light  to the superlattices . As is known, the propagating incident light  defines an optical-electric field  that is perpendicular to the propagation direction of the incident light . The metal contacts ,  are subsequently annealed to provide ohmic contacts.","The result of the fabrication process yields a lamellar grid pattern as shown in . In other words, the fabrication process yields a plurality of gridlines  that each has a fixed width (w), a fixed depth (t), and a fixed spacing (s). While a three-dimensional perspective view of the QGIP element  having a lamellar grid pattern is shown in , it should be appreciated that a cross-grid pattern or other equivalent patterns may also be used to generate the QGIP element .","As shown in , the lamellar grid pattern of the QGIP element  includes gridlines  of a fixed length (l) that are arranged in a linear array across the breadth (b) of the QGIP element . The two ohmic contacts (e.g., wire bonding , ) are shown in  at one end of the QGIP element . The length (l) of the gridlines  and the number of gridlines  in a QGIP element  do not significantly affect light-coupling characteristics (e.g., light absorption, resonant scattering of light, etc.) of the QGIP element . However, the width (w) of the gridlines  affects light-coupling characteristics of the QGIP element . In some embodiments, it is desirable to have the width (w) of the gridlines  be an odd multiple of the half-wavelength of the detection wavelength in the superlattice material. In other words, if the superlattice material is adapted to detect a wavelength of \u03bb, then the width (w) of the gridline  should be approximately: \n\n\nwhere N is an odd integer and \u03bbis the incident wavelength in the material. The incident wavelength of the material is defined as: \n\n\nwhere \u03bb is the wavelength in free space and \u03b5 is the dielectric constant of the material. Given Equations 1 and 2, the metal layer  on top of each gridline  acts as a resonant multi-pole antenna due to the selected width (w). The resonant properties of the metal layer  result in scattering of any incident light  that enters through the substrate . In other words, the width (w) of the metal layer  on each gridline  defines a scattered field, which further defines the absorption characteristics of the QGIP element .\n","As shown in , the gridlines , in addition to being the active absorbing material, also provide a two-fold function. First, the gridlines  behave as dielectric waveguides  for normal incident light . Second the gridlines  behave as resonators for scattered light . In operation, as incident light  enters through the substrate , each gridline  directs the incident light  through the superlattice  to the top metal layer . In this regard, the gridline  behaves as a dielectric waveguide  for the incident light . Upon being directed to the top metal layer , the light is reflected and scattered by the metal layer . The reflected and scattered light  resonates through each of the gridlines  and is absorbed by the superlattice  structure of the gridlines .","Due to the selected width (w), the wave-guiding properties of the gridlines  have fundamental modes of approximately \n\n\nSince the fundamental modes of the waveguide  are integer multiples of half-wavelengths, these wave-guiding properties further strengthen the scattered field at the multi-pole resonant wavelengths and sharpen the absorption width for each QGIP element .\n","Electromagnetic simulations have shown that the optical absorption increases and the absorption bandwidth decreases when the height (t) of the gridlines  increases. Additionally, beyond a certain gridline height (t), the absorption decreases with increasing height (t). In other words, according to simulation results, an optimum wavelength-dependent gridline depth (t) exists. For example, for \u03bb of approximately 9 \u03bcm, the optimum gridline depth (t) would be approximately 3.0 \u03bcm. Since each gridline  also affects the scattering field of other gridlines , the spacing (s) between gridlines  should, preferably, be large. Simulations have shown that a gridline spacing of between approximately 3 \u03bcm to approximately 5 \u03bcm should be adequate to isolate scattering fields from adjacent gridlines .","In one simulation, when the spectrometer  of  was designed to detect wavelengths (\u03bb) of approximately:\n\n\u03bb={7.5, 8, 8.5, 9, 9.5, 10, 10.5, 11, 11.5, 12 \u03bcm}\u2003\u2003[Equation 3],\n\neach QGIP element was configured to have corresponding gridline widths (w) of approximately:\n\nw={3.45, 3.74, 4.03, 4.32, 4.61, 4.9, 5.19, 5.48, 5.77, 6.06 \u03bcm}\u2003\u2003[Equation 4],\n\na gridline spacing (s) of approximately 3 \u03bcm, and a gridline depth (t) of approximately 3 \u03bcm. The electromagnetic simulations showed that the full-width-at-half-maximum (\u0393) of the detected peak was approximately 0.8 \u03bcm when the spectrometer  had a resonance of N=3.\n","In another simulation, when the spectrometer  was designed to detect at wavelengths of approximately:\n\n\u03bb={6, 7, 8, 9, 10, 11, 12, 13, 14, 15 \u03bcm}\u2003\u2003[Equation 5],\n\neach QGIP element  was configured to have corresponding gridline widths (w) of approximately:\n\nw={0.736, 0.942, 1.148, 1.354, 1.56, 1.766, 1.972, 2.178, 2.384, 2.59 \u03bcm}\u2003\u2003[Equation 6],\n\nand a gridline spacing (s) of approximately 5 \u03bcm. Here, the spectrometer  utilized an N=1 dipole resonance, and the calculated \u0393 was approximately 0.7 \u03bcm when the gridline depth (t) was approximately 3 \u03bcm.\n",{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0040","num":"0039"},"figref":["FIG. 3A","FIGS. 2A through 2C","FIG. 4A"],"b":["215","215","215","310","310","310","310","430","420","310","310","310","110","310","420","430"],"i":["a, ","b "]},{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0041","num":"0040"},"figref":["FIG. 3B","FIG. 3B"],"b":["215","260","430","330","420","215","330","420","332","334","420","310","310","420","430","310","460","470","310","460","470","420","430","310"],"i":["a ","a ","a, ","a ","a ","b.

In some embodiments, the basis unit  is a binary basis unit that comprises two quantum wells , . However, it should be appreciated that the basis unit  may be a single quantum well, a ternary quantum well, or a basis unit  having any integer value k as a basis.","The superlattice unit  further comprises several relatively thin inter-unit barriers (B) . . . (hereinafter simply referred to as \u201cinter-unit barrier(s) \u201d). Each inter-unit barrier  separates adjacent basis units . Additionally, each inter-unit barrier  permits energy coupling between adjacent basis units . In the embodiment of , the basis units  are binary basis units  that each having a first quantum well . . . (hereinafter simply referred to as \u201cfirst quantum well(s) \u201d) and a second quantum well . . . (hereinafter simply referred to as \u201csecond quantum well(s) \u201d). The first quantum well  and the second quantum well  may be manufactured using quantum-well infrared photodetector (QWIP) material. In each binary basis unit , the first quantum well  is separated from the second quantum well  by an inter-well barrier (B) . . . (hereinafter simply referred to as \u201cinter-well barrier(s) \u201d). Similar to the inter-unit barriers , the inter-well barriers  are relatively thin barriers that permit well-to-well energy coupling.","The inter-well energy coupling and the inter-unit energy coupling result in a degeneration of energy levels. The degeneration of energy levels forms the minibands , . The upper miniband  of energy levels are grouped together at approximately the upper energy level of the quantum well while the lower miniband  of energy levels are grouped together at approximately the lower energy level of the quantum well. Hence, the degeneration of energy levels manifests itself as a separation of energy (or wavelength) peaks in a spectrum. As shown in , for three binary basis units , the lower miniband  has six degenerate energy levels that range from a lower degenerate energy level of \u03b51 through an upper degenerate energy level of \u03b56. Similarly, the three binary basis units  result in an upper miniband  having six degenerate energy levels that range from a lower degenerate energy level of \u03b57 through an upper degenerate energy level of \u03b512. These degenerate energy levels are described in greater detail by Choi et al. in \u201cQWIP Structural Optimization,\u201d (hereinafter \u201cthe SPIE reference\u201d) presented at the 47th Annual Meeting of the SPIE, held on Jul. 7 through 13, 2002 in Seattle, Wash. The SPIE reference is incorporated herein by reference as if set forth in its entirety. Additionally, the formation of the degenerate energy levels is described in greater detail with reference to .","The superlattice unit  further comprises superlattice barriers , , which are located at each end of the superlattice unit . As discussed above, the superlattice barriers ,  are adapted to prevent electron transfer between the lower minibands  of the superlattice units  while permitting electron transfer between the upper minibands  of the superlattice units .","A specific example of a broadband QWIP material may have parameters adapted to detect between an approximately 7 \u03bcm- to 15 \u03bcm-wavelength range. In one embodiment of a binary basis unit , the wells ,  are made of GaAs while the inter-well barriers  are made of AlGaAs. In that embodiment, the well thicknesses are approximately 70 \u212b and 75 \u212b, respectively, and the inter-well barrier thickness is approximately 25 \u212b. The inter-unit barriers are made of AlGaAs, and the inter-unit barrier thickness is approximately 25 \u212b. Given an absorption line broadening (\u03c3) of approximately 11 meV, four basis units  are typically needed to obtain a smooth absorption spectrum. With approximately 11 meV in line broadening, the QWIP material maintains a relatively uniform absorption between approximately 7 \u03bcm to approximately 15 \u03bcm wavelength range.","An example embodiment of the superlattice  comprises eight periods of superlattice units . Each superlattice unit  comprises four periods of binary basis units , and each superlattice unit  is separated from an adjacent superlattice unit  by an approximately 600 \u212b undoped AlGaAs superlattice barrier ,  and an approximately 25 \u212b undoped AlGaAs inter-unit barrier . Each binary basis unit  comprises an approximately 70 \u212b GaAs well , an approximately 25 \u212b AlGaAs inter-well barrier , and an approximately 75 \u212b GaAs well . Each binary basis unit  is separated from adjacent binary basis units  by an approximately 25 \u212b AlGaAs inter-unit barrier . All of the barriers and the wells have a Si doping density of approximately 4\u00d710cm. The eight-period superlattice units  are sandwiched between an approximately 1000 \u212b GaAs top contact layer  and an approximately 2.5 \u03bcm GaAs bottom contact layer , both doped to approximately 4\u00d710cm. The material layers are grown on a GaAs semi-insulating substrate.",{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0049","num":"0048"},"figref":["FIGS. 4B and 4C","FIG. 4A","FIG. 4C"],"b":["410","412","414","412","412","1","432","2","422","414","414","1","2","1","434","2","424","270","270"]},"When a plurality of quantum wells ,  are stacked together but separated by relatively thick barriers, a multiple quantum well (MQW) is formed as an aggregate of the stacked, individual quantum wells , . Typically, due to the relatively thick barriers, each of the quantum wells ,  maintains its own absorption characteristics with very little effect on adjacent quantum wells , . However, when barrier thicknesses are reduced, the electron wave functions in each well ,  begin to spread into adjacent wells , . The spreading of the electron wave functions into adjacent wells results in degenerate energy levels ,  that are common to all of the quantum wells , . In other words, if there are N quantum wells in a given structure, then there will be N slightly-separated energy levels that form an upper miniband  and N slightly-separated energy levels that form a lower miniband . Optical transitions can initiate from any one of the N slightly-separated energy levels in the lower miniband  to any one of the N slightly-separated energy levels in upper miniband  with certain oscillator strength.","In a specific example, if two quantum wells ,  are of different sizes (e.g., different well width, different well depth, or both), then each quantum well ,  has a different quantized energy level (e.g., E to E for the first well, and E\u2032 to E\u2032 for the second well). The different quantized energy levels result in different absorption energies by each of the quantum wells ,  when the quantum wells ,  are far apart. When the sizes of the wells are sufficiently different, the two absorption energies may be separated from each other, resulting in two distinct absorption peaks. By joining the two quantum wells ,  together using a relatively thin inter-well barrier  to form a binary basis unit , the original energy levels change into degenerate common energy levels (e.g., e, e, e, and e) \u2032, \u2032 in the binary basis unit . The four possible new transitions (e.g., e to c, c to e, e to e, and e to e) create four absorption peaks. Since the separation between e and e is relatively small, the four peaks typically group into two widely separated pairs of peaks. The aggregation of additional binary basis units  results in a superlattice unit  having a greater number of degenerate energy levels. The increasing number of degenerate energy levels (as shown, for example, by ) results in a relatively continuous spectrum. Since the quantum wells having binary basis units  are further discussed in U.S. Pat. No. Re 34,649, further discussion of binary basis units  is omitted here.","As shown from , since the wavelength selectivity is built into each QGIP element , the operation of the QGIP spectrometer  is simple and reliable. Additionally, due to the inherent characteristics of the QGIP elements , the QGIP spectrometer  is portable, small, and light. Furthermore, the QGIP spectrometer  need not be calibrated in the field because the wavelength selectivity is fabricated into each QGIP element . In this regard, many deficiencies associated with conventional spectrometers are addressed by the QGIP spectrometer  as shown and described above.","While an individual QGIP spectrometer  may be used for performing spectroscopic measurements, several QGIP spectrometers  may be combined to create imaging systems. For example,  shows a QGIP imager  formed by concatenating multiple QGIP spectrometers . . . (hereinafter simply referred to in the aggregate as \u201cQGIP spectrometer(s) \u201d). As shown in , the two-dimensional array of QGIP spectrometers  may yield spatial images as well as spectra for a particular scene. If many rows of QGIP spectrometers , from 1 to n, are arranged as shown, and the entire array is moved from right to left at constant speed, a scene may be sequentially imaged at different wavelengths. Alternatively, the image of the scene may be scanned into each column of the array sequentially using moving mirrors (not shown) to detect the scene at different wavelengths. Under such conditions, hyperspectral imaging may be performed.","In other embodiments, an areal image may be obtained by adding repeating columns of QGIP spectrometers . By reading signals from different rows and columns of the corresponding spectrometer elements, an image of a particular wavelength may be formed. This arrangement eliminates the need for a scanning mirror.","It can be appreciated from the example of  that the compact and robust nature of the QGIP spectrometer  permits use of the QGIP spectrometer  as a building block for many types of imaging systems. While an imaging system is specifically illustrated in , the QGIP spectrometer  may be a component part of other, more complex systems employing spectroscopic measurements.",{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0056","num":"0055"},"figref":["FIGS. 6 through 8","FIG. 6","FIG. 7"],"b":["600","700","800","600","620","620","620","600","630","620","720","730"]},"In some embodiments, the step of detecting () energy may further be defined as shown in  to include the steps of receiving () incident light through a substrate layer of each of the QGIP elements.

Preferably, the scattered incident light resonates through the QGIP element at a predefined frequency that preferably corresponds to an integer multiple of a half wavelength. The scattered () light is then absorbed by the QGIP element.","Embodiments of processes adapted for imaging may also include the step of arranging the plurality of QGIP elements into a matrix of elements.
