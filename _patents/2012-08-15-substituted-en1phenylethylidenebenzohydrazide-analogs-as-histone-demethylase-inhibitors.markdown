C. and Baylin, S. B. 2011, 21 (3), 502-17; and Fullgrabe, J., Kavanagh, E., and Joseph, B. 2011). The regulation of the modifications on DNA and the proteins associated with DNA has become an area of intense interest and the enzymes involved in these processes have been suggested as a new class of protein targets for drug development. The major proteins associated with DNA are histone proteins. Histone tails are subject to a variety of posttranslational modifications, such as phosphorylation, acetylation, methylation, and ubiquitination, and these modifications, especially acetylation and methylation on lysine residues, play a major role in the regulation of gene expression, and are often dysregulated in cancer (Fullgrabe, J., Kavanagh, E., and Joseph, B. 2011).","Recently an enzyme called Lysine-Specific Demethylase 1 (LSD1) was found to catalyze the oxidative demethylation of monomethylated and dimethylated histone H3 at lysine 4 (H3K4me1 and H3K4me2) and lysine 9 (H3K9me1 and H3K9me2) through a flavin adenine dinucleotide (FAD)-dependent reaction (Shi, Y., et al. 2004, 119 (7), 941-53; and Metzger, E., et al. 2005, 437 (7057), 436-9), Whereas histone acetylation is associated with loose chromatin and gene activation, methylation of histones is less straightforward. Using the lysine residues regulated by LSD1 as an example, methylation at H3K4 is generally associated with gene activation, while methylation of H3K9 is associated with transcriptional repression.","There is currently one known mammalian homolog of LSD1 which is a protein variously designated LSD2, KDM1b, and AOF1. It shares a similar domain homology, but exhibits less than 31% sequence identity (Fang, R. et al. 2010, 39:222-233). It has been shown that LSD2 is a H3K4me1\/2 demethylase that specifically regulates histone H3K4 methylation within intragenic regions of its target genes (ibid.). Both LSD1 and LSD2 contain a SWIRM domain, a FAD coenzyme-binding motif, and a C-terminal amine oxidase domain, all of which are critical to the enzymatic activity. However, unlike LSD1, the protein LSD2 contains a CW-type zinc finger domain in its N-terminal domain, a region which is unstructured in LSD1. Furthermore, LSD2 lacks the \u201ctower domain\u201d of LSD1. At a cellular level, it has been suggested that LSD2 has a role in transcriptional regulation (ibid.). As expected, LSD2 appears to play a role in regulating DNA methylation as well, although the role in DNA methylation may be developmental stage specific (ibid.; Ciccone, D. N., et al. 2009 461:415-418; Karytinos, A., et al. 2009 284:17775-17782; and Yang, Z., et al. 2010 20:276-287).","Several lines of evidence point to LSD1 as being a possible therapeutic target in cancer. LSD1 is reportedly over-expressed in a variety of tumors including neuroblastoma, ER-negative breast, bladder, lung, and colorectal tumors (Schulte, J. H., et al. 2009, 69 (5), 2065-71; Lim, S., et al. 2010, 31 (3), 512-20; and Hayami, S., et al. 2011, 128 (3), 574-86). Increased methylation of the permissive H3K4 mark by LSD1 inhibition has been shown to reactivate expression of tumor suppressor genes in cancer models (Huang, Y., et al. 2009, 15 (23), 7217-28). In addition, LSD1 has been found to associate with estrogen and androgen receptors leading to the specific demethylation of the repressive H3K9 mark, thereby increasing target gene expression (Metzger, E., et al. 2005, 437 (7057), 436-9; and Garcia-Bassets, I., et al. 2007, 128 (3), 505-18). Thus, depending upon cofactors bound to LSD1, demethylation by LSD1 can contribute to cancer through both the permissive H3K4 and the repressive H3K9 mark. Therefore, the inhibition of LSD1 might be an effective strategy for re-expression of epigenetically silenced tumor suppressor genes as well as down regulation of important cancer pathways in a number of cancer types. Several LSD1 inhibitors have been reported, but they have shown poor selectivity and\/or pharmacological properties, making further exploration of LSD1 biology difficult.","Monoamine oxidase (MAO) inhibitors such as tranylcypromine and pargyline have been reported as LSD1 inhibitors, and there have been several reports regarding attempts to discover derivatives with increased selectivity for LSD1 over MAO (Mimasu, S., et al. 2010, 49 (30), 6494-503; Binda, C., et al. 2010, 132 (19), 6827-33; Culhane, J. C., et al. 2006, 128 (14), 4536-7; Culhane, J. C., et al. 2010, 132 (9), 3164-76; and Ueda, R., et al. 2009, 131 (48), 17536-7). These compounds irreversibly inactivate LSD1 by covalent binding to the FAD cofactor. Polyamine derivatives have also been evaluated as LSD1 inhibitors, where compounds with activity in the \u03bcM range have been described (Huang, Y., et al. 2009, 15 (23), 7217-28; Sharma, S. K., et al. 2010, 53 (14), 5197-212; and Huang, Y., et al. 2007, 104 (19), 8023-8). In general, these and other reported LSD1 inhibitors are neither adequately selective nor potent enough to optimally interact with the crucial amino acid residues of the substrate-binding site present in LSD1.","In summary, the LSD proteins play a key role in epigenetic and transcriptional regulation, and they are frequently altered in mammalian cancers, thus making them an attractive target for therapeutic intervention. Despite advances in drug discovery directed to identifying inhibitors of LSD1 and\/or LSD2 protein activity, there is still a scarcity of compounds that are both potent, efficacious, and selective inhibitors of either LSD1 or LSD2. Furthermore, there is a scarcity of compounds effective in the treatment of cancer and other diseases associated with dysfunction in LSD1 and\/or LSD2. These needs and other needs are satisfied by the present invention.","In accordance with the purpose(s) of the invention, as embodied and broadly described herein, the invention, in one aspect, relates to compounds useful useful as inhibitors of lysine-specific demethylase, or LSD.

For example, the term \u201cdiagnosed with a need for inhibition of histone demethylase activity\u201d refers to having been subjected to a physical examination by a person of skill, for example, a physician, and found to have a condition that can be diagnosed or treated by inhibition of histone demethylase activity. For example, \u201cdiagnosed with a need for treatment of one or more disorders of uncontrolled cellular proliferation associated with a histone demethylase dysfunction\u201d means having been subjected to a physical examination by a person of skill, for example, a physician, and found to have one or more disorders of uncontrolled cellular proliferation associated with a histone demethylase dysfunction.","As used herein, the phrase \u201cidentified to be in need of treatment for a disorder,\u201d or the like, refers to selection of a subject based upon need for treatment of the disorder. For example, a subject can be identified as having a need for treatment of a disorder (e.g., a disorder related to a dysfunction of histone demethylase activity) based upon an earlier diagnosis by a person of skill and thereafter subjected to treatment for the disorder. It is contemplated that the identification can, in one aspect, be performed by a person different from the person making the diagnosis. It is also contemplated, in a further aspect, that the administration can be performed by one who subsequently performed the administration.","As used herein, the terms \u201cadministering\u201d and \u201cadministration\u201d refer to any method of providing a pharmaceutical preparation to a subject. Such methods are well known to those skilled in the art and include, but are not limited to, oral administration, transdermal administration, administration by inhalation, nasal administration, topical administration, intravaginal administration, ophthalmic administration, intraaural administration, intracerebral administration, rectal administration, sublingual administration, buccal administration, intraurethral administration, and parenteral administration, including injectable such as intravenous administration, intra-arterial administration, intramuscular administration, and subcutaneous administration. Administration can be continuous or intermittent. In various aspects, a preparation can be administered therapeutically; that is, administered to treat an existing disease or condition. In further various aspects, a preparation can be administered prophylactically; that is, administered for prevention of a disease or condition.","The term \u201ccontacting\u201d as used herein refers to bringing a disclosed compound and a cell, target receptor, or other biological entity together in such a manner that the compound can affect the activity of the target (e.g., receptor, cell, etc.), either directly; i.e., by interacting with the target itself, or indirectly; i.e., by interacting with another molecule, co-factor, factor, or protein on which the activity of the target is dependent.","As used herein, the terms \u201ceffective amount\u201d and \u201camount effective\u201d refer to an amount that is sufficient to achieve the desired result or to have an effect on an undesired condition. For example, a \u201ctherapeutically effective amount\u201d refers to an amount that is sufficient to achieve the desired therapeutic result or to have an effect on undesired symptoms, but is generally insufficient to cause adverse side affects. The specific therapeutically effective dose level for any particular patient will depend upon a variety of factors including the disorder being treated and the severity of the disorder; the specific composition employed; the age, body weight, general health, sex, and diet of the patient; the time of administration; the route of administration; the rate of excretion of the specific compound employed; the duration of the treatment; drugs used in combination or coincidental with the specific compound employed and like factors well known in the medical arts. For example, it is well within the skill of the art to start doses of a compound at levels lower than those required to achieve the desired therapeutic effect and to gradually increase the dosage until the desired effect is achieved. If desired, the effective daily dose can be divided into multiple doses for purposes of administration. Consequently, single dose compositions can contain such amounts or submultiples thereof to make up the daily dose. The dosage can be adjusted by the individual physician in the event of any contraindications. Dosage can vary, and can be administered in one or more dose administrations daily, for one or several days. Guidance can be found in the literature for appropriate dosages for given classes of pharmaceutical products. In further various aspects, a preparation can be administered in a \u201cprophylactically effective amount\u201d; that is, an amount effective for prevention of a disease or condition.","As used herein, \u201cEC,\u201d is intended to refer to the concentration of a substance (e.g., a compound or a drug) that is required for 50% agonism or activation of a biological process, or component of a process, including a protein, subunit, organelle, ribonucleoprotein, etc. In one aspect, an ECcan refer to the concentration of a substance that is required for 50% agonism or activation in vivo, as further defined elsewhere herein. In a further aspect, ECrefers to the concentration of agonist or activator that provokes a response halfway between the baseline and maximum response.","As used herein, \u201cIC,\u201d is intended to refer to the concentration of a substance (e.g., a compound or a drug) that is required for 50% inhibition of a biological process, or component of a process, including a protein, subunit, organelle, ribonucleoprotein, etc. For example, an ICcan refer to the concentration of a substance that is required for 50% inhibition in vivo or the inhibition is measured in vitro, as further defined elsewhere herein.

Proper fluidity can be maintained, for example, by the use of coating materials such as lecithin, by the maintenance of the required particle size in the case of dispersions and by the use of surfactants. These compositions can also contain adjuvants such as preservatives, wetting agents, emulsifying agents and dispersing agents. Prevention of the action of microorganisms can be ensured by the inclusion of various antibacterial and antifungal agents such as paraben, chlorobutanol, phenol, sorbic acid and the like. It can also be desirable to include isotonic agents such as sugars, sodium chloride and the like. Prolonged absorption of the injectable pharmaceutical form can be brought about by the inclusion of agents, such as aluminum monostearate and gelatin, which delay absorption. Injectable depot forms are made by forming microencapsule matrices of the drug in biodegradable polymers such as polylactide-polyglycolide, poly(orthoesters) and poly(anhydrides). Depending upon the ratio of drug to polymer and the nature of the particular polymer employed, the rate of drug release can be controlled. Depot injectable formulations are also prepared by entrapping the drug in liposomes or microemulsions which are compatible with body tissues. The injectable formulations can be sterilized, for example, by filtration through a bacterial-retaining filter or by incorporating sterilizing agents in the form of sterile solid compositions which can be dissolved or dispersed in sterile water or other sterile injectable media just prior to use. Suitable inert carriers can include sugars such as lactose. Desirably, at least 95% by weight of the particles of the active ingredient have an effective particle size in the range of 0.01 to 10 micrometers.","A residue of a chemical species, as used in the specification and concluding claims, refers to the moiety that is the resulting product of the chemical species in a particular reaction scheme or subsequent formulation or chemical product, regardless of whether the moiety is actually obtained from the chemical species. Thus, an ethylene glycol residue in a polyester refers to one or more \u2014OCHCHO\u2014 units in the polyester, regardless of whether ethylene glycol was used to prepare the polyester. Similarly, a sebacic acid residue in a polyester refers to one or more \u2014CO(CH)CO\u2014 moieties in the polyester, regardless of whether the residue is obtained by reacting sebacic acid or an ester thereof to obtain the polyester.","As used herein, the term \u201csubstituted\u201d is contemplated to include all permissible substituents of organic compounds.

In describing an optically active compound, the prefixes D and L or R and S are used to denote the absolute configuration of the molecule about its chiral center(s). The prefixes d and l or (+) and (\u2212) are employed to designate the sign of rotation of plane-polarized light by the compound, with (\u2212) or l meaning that the compound is levorotatory. A compound prefixed with (+) or d is dextrorotatory. For a given chemical structure, these compounds, called stereoisomers, are identical except that they are non-superimposable mirror images of one another. A specific stereoisomer can also be referred to as an enantiomer, and a mixture of such isomers is often called an enantiomeric mixture. A 50:50 mixture of enantiomers is referred to as a racemic mixture. Many of the compounds described herein can have one or more chiral centers and therefore can exist in different enantiomeric forms. If desired, a chiral carbon can be designated with an asterisk (*). When bonds to the chiral carbon are depicted as straight lines in the disclosed formulas, it is understood that both the (R) and (S) configurations of the chiral carbon, and hence both enantiomers and mixtures thereof, are embraced within the formula. As is used in the art, when it is desired to specify the absolute configuration about a chiral carbon, one of the bonds to the chiral carbon can be depicted as a wedge (bonds to atoms above the plane) and the other can be depicted as a series or wedge of short parallel lines is (bonds to atoms below the plane).

Certain isotopically-labelled compounds of the present invention, for example those into which radioactive isotopes such as H and C are incorporated, are useful in drug and\/or substrate tissue distribution assays. Tritiated, i.e., H, and carbon-14, i.e., C, isotopes are particularly preferred for their ease of preparation and detectability. Further, substitution with heavier isotopes such as deuterium, i.e., H, can afford certain therapeutic advantages resulting from greater metabolic stability, for example increased in vivo half-life or reduced dosage requirements and, hence, may be preferred in some circumstances. Isotopically labelled compounds of the present invention and prodrugs thereof can generally be prepared by carrying out the procedures below, by substituting a readily available isotopically labelled reagent for a non-isotopically labelled reagent.","The compounds described in the invention can be present as a solvate.

Accordingly, the pharmaceutical compositions include those that also contain one or more other active ingredients, in addition to a compound of the present invention.","The weight ratio of a disclosed compound to the second active ingredient can be varied and will depend upon the effective dose of each ingredient. Generally, an effective dose of each will be used. Thus, for example, when a compound of the present invention is combined with another agent, the weight ratio of a disclosed compound to the other agent will generally range from about 1000:1 to about 1:1000, preferably about 200:1 to about 1:200. Combinations of a compound of the present invention and other active ingredients will generally also be within the aforementioned range, but in each case, an effective dose of each active ingredient should be used.","In such combinations a disclosed compound and other active agents can be administered separately or in conjunction.

Within this range the dosage can be 0.05 to 0.5, 0.5 to 5 or 5 to 50 mg\/kg per day. For oral administration, the compositions are preferably provided in the form of tablets containing 1.0 to 1000 milligrams of the active ingredient, particularly 1.0, 5.0, 10, 15, 20, 25, 50, 75, 100, 150, 200, 250, 300, 400, 500, 600, 750, 800, 900, and 1000 milligrams of the active ingredient for the symptomatic adjustment of the dosage to the patient to be treated. The compounds can be administered on a regimen of 1 to 4 times per day, preferably once or twice per day. This dosage regimen can be adjusted to provide the optimal therapeutic response. It will be understood, however, that the specific dose level and frequency of dosage for any particular patient can be varied and will depend upon a variety of factors including the activity of the specific compound employed, the metabolic stability and length of action of that compound, the age, body weight, general health, sex, diet, mode and time of administration, rate of excretion, drug combination, the severity of the particular condition, and the host undergoing therapy.","Thus, in one aspect, the invention relates to methods for inhibiting or negatively modulating LSD in at least one cell, comprising the step of contacting the at least one cell with at least one compound of the invention, in an amount effective to modulate or activate LSD activity response, e.g. LSD1 or LSD2, in the at least one cell.

Manufacture of a Medicament","In one aspect, the invention relates to a method for the manufacture of a medicament for inhibition of histone demethylase activity in a mammal comprising combining a therapeutically effective amount of a disclosed compound or product of a disclosed method with a pharmaceutically acceptable carrier or diluent.","The following examples are put forth so as to provide those of ordinary skill in the art with a complete disclosure and description of how the compounds, compositions, articles, devices and\/or methods claimed herein are made and evaluated, and are intended to be purely exemplary of the invention and are not intended to limit the scope of what the inventors regard as their invention. Efforts have been made to ensure accuracy with respect to numbers (e.g., amounts, temperature, etc.), but some errors and deviations should be accounted for. Unless indicated otherwise, parts are parts by weight, temperature is in \u00b0 C. or is at ambient temperature, and pressure is at or near atmospheric.","Several methods for preparing the compounds of this invention are illustrated in the following Examples. Starting materials and the requisite intermediates are in some cases commercially available, or can be prepared according to literature procedures or as illustrated herein.","The following exemplary compounds of the invention were synthesized. The Examples are provided herein to illustrate the invention, and should not be construed as limiting the invention in any way. The Examples are typically depicted in free base form, according to the IUPAC naming convention. However, some of the Examples were obtained or isolated in salt form.","As indicated, some of the Examples were obtained as racemic mixtures of one or more enantiomers or diastereomers. The compounds may be separated by one skilled in the art to isolate individual enantiomers. Separation can be carried out by the coupling of a racemic mixture of compounds to an enantiomerically pure compound to form a diastereomeric mixture, followed by separation of the individual diastereomers by standard methods, such as fractional crystallization or chromatography. A racemic or diastereomeric mixture of the compounds can also be separated directly by chromatographic methods using chiral stationary phases.","All analytical or anhydrous grade reagents were purchased from commercial sources and were used without further purification. Solvents were of analytical or anhydrous grade (Sigma-Aldrich). Specialty chemicals and building blocks obtained from several suppliers were of the highest offered purity (always \u226795%)","NMR spectroscopy was performed on a Varian Unity 400 instrument with a 5 mm broadband probe and using standard pulse sequences. Chemical shifts (\u03b4) are reported in parts-per-million (ppm) downfield from solvent references. Coupling constants (J-values) are expressed in Hz.","Mass spectrometry was performed on a Finnigan LCQ Duo LCMS ion trap electrospray (ESI) mass spectrometer. All samples were analyzed by positive ESI-MS and the mass-to-charge ratio (m\/z) of the protonated molecular ion is reported.","Microwave-assisted reactions were performed on a Biotage Initiator 2.5 at various powers.","Hydrogenation reactions were performed on a standard Parr hydrogenation apparatus.","Reactions were monitored either by HPLC or TLC. When monitored by TLC, reactions were analyzed on Baker flexible-backed plates coated with 200 \u03bcm of silica gel containing a fluorescent indicator. Preparative TLC was performed on 20 cm\u00d720 cm Analtech Uniplates coated with a 1000 or 2000 \u03bcm silica gel layer containing a fluorescent (UV 254) indicator. Elution mixtures are reported as v:v. Spot visualization was achieved using UV light.","Flash chromatography was performed on a Teledyne Isco CombiFlash RF 200 using appropriately sized Redisep Rf Gold or Standard normal-phase silica or reversed-phase C-18 columns. Crude compounds were adsorbed on silica gel, 70-230 mesh 40 \u212b (for normal phase) or Celite 503 (for reversed-phase) and loaded into solid cartridges. Elution mixtures are reported as v:v.","All computational studies employed PDB ID 2Z5U for the structural coordinates of LSD1. Virtual docking methods ICM, Glide and GOLD programs were implemented. The protein structure was prepared by 3D protonation, deletion of water molecules and energy minimization using the ICM force field and distance-dependent dielectric potential with an RMS gradient of 0.1; heavy atoms in the protein were kept fixed, and histidine residues were considered as neutral. Virtual screening calculations utilized default parameters (unless explicitly specified otherwise) with ICM and Glide scores as scoring functions respectively. In both cases, FAD was defined as the ligand and an active site region was defined by a sphere of radius 12 \u212b around the bound FAD in complex with LSD1.","Confirmation of the accuracy and efficiency of the applied docking protocol used the FAD cofactor adenine dinucleotide fragment, and the flavin fragment, and known LSD1 inhibitors (decoy set) as positive controls. Two separate docking runs were carried out with ICM and the Glide docking program; GOLD docking was employed for re-scoring.","The compound database was prepared using Ligprep 2.1.23 (Schr\u00f6dinger, LLC., New York, N.Y.). Two rounds of VS, including HTVS and standard precision (SP) docking, were adopted. The top 10000 compounds ranked by Glide were stored and submitted for additional docking experiments using ICM docking. The final set of 2000 hits was selected based on ICM scores and individual compounds were visually inspected to check the docking poses and interactions between ligands and LSD1. GOLD consensus scoring functions were employed further to re-score these 2000 hits selected from Glide and ICM. Finally, 121 compounds were purchased (if available) or synthesized for LSD1 inhibition studies.","All simulations were performed using the AMBER ff99SB force field (Hornak, V., et al. 2006, 65 (3), 712-25) for LSD1, the general Amber force field (\u201cgaff\u201d; see Wang, J., et al. 2004, 25 (9), 1157-74) for compound 12, and the TIP3P (Jorgensen, W. L., 1982, (77), 4156-4163) model for water was employed. The simulations approximated long-range electrostatic interactions using the particle-mesh Ewald method (PME) procedure (Essmann, U., et al. 1995, (103), 8577-8593; Darden, T., et al. 1993, (98), 10089-10092). Using LEaP the binding modes generated from ICM docking in complex with LSD1 were solvated to neutral charge and the complexes were first minimized with PMEMD (Case, D. A., et al. AMBER11, San Francisco, 2010). Following minimization, 200 ps of unrestrained molecular dynamics simulation using a non-bonded interaction cutoff of 9 \u212b was run for both binding modes with a constant pressure periodic boundary maintaining 1 atm of pressure and isotropic position scaling with a relaxation time of 2 ps. SHAKE was used to constrain bonds involving hydrogen and Langevin dynamics were used to regulate temperature (Case, D. A., et al. AMBER11, San Francisco, 2010), maintaining 300 K. Relative free energies of binding for comparisons between the two binding modes were predicted using MMPBSA.pywith 100 snapshots at 1-ps intervals starting either at 1 ps or 101 ps into the trajectory.","The first crystal structures of LSD1 elucidating critical architectural features were later by Stavropoulos et al. (2006, 13(7):626-32; Protein Data Bank or PDB ID 2H94; see http:\/\/www.wwpdb.org\/), Yang et al. (2006, 23 (3), 377-87; PDB ID 21W5), and Chen et al. (2006, 103 (38), 13956-61; PDB ID 2HKO). These 2.9 \u212b, 2.57 \u212b, and 2.8 \u212b structures, respectively, show a highly negatively charged substrate-binding cavity spacious enough to accommodate the N-terminal tail of histone H3. Further, an N-terminal SWIRM domain and an insertion in the core catalytic domain, termed the Tower Domain, were established as necessary structural motifs for enzymatic activity and interactions with cofactors such as CoREST. For the studies described herein, the structure, PDB ID 2Z5U, was used with bound LSD1 inhibitor tranylcypromine for computational studies, including virtual screening, docking, and molecular dynamics (Mimasu, S., et al. 2008, 366 (1), 15-22). In order to evaluate the chemical space outside of tranylcypromine and polyamine derivatives, HTVS was used with an in-house library. The library was curated from publicly available vendor libraries, totaling approximately 13 million compounds, using custom filters developed in-house. Compounds were filtered based on Lipinski's rule of five, with exceptions occurring in only 62,000 compounds. Further, structurally redundant compounds were removed such that the resulting library contained a diverse, yet manageable set of about 2 million compounds. Prior to screening, compounds were prepared using the LigPrep module of the Schrodinger Suite as well as ICM's inbuilt preparation of three-dimensional (3D) ligands such that physiologically relevant protonation states were used.","Prepared ligands were then docked against three different sites on LSD1; the FAD site located in the amine oxidase domain, and the adenine dinucleotide and flavin fragments of this pocket. The docking protocols used by both ICM and Glide were run with the FAD, adenine dinucleotide, flavin fragments, and known LSD1 inhibitors to check for accuracy. In addition to the docking algorithm rankings, visual inspection of the docking results was used to evaluate binding position, suitable pose, and orientation. Taken together, the scoring functions from ICM and Glide were able to correctly identify known inhibitors within the top 2% of the decoy set used. GOLD was used to re-score and the GOLD fitness function produced similar enrichments.","A virtual screen was set up against the FAD-binding pocket of LSD1 using the established docking protocol and the 2 million-compound database. The top 10,000 compounds were selected from both ICM and Glide scoring functions for further analysis. A few identical compounds were scored similarly between the two algorithms; this redundancy was filtered out. Furthermore, visual inspection was performed to filter out similar compounds and to increase the diversity of the final selection. Visual analysis also allowed identification of key interactions within the FAD-binding pocked of LSD1. These include hydrogen bonding with Ser289, Arg310 and Arg316, van der Waals interactions with Val590 and Leu625, and it interactions with Trp756. Moreover, compounds with hydroxyl and hydrophobic electron withdrawing groups seemed to show increased enrichment in the initial docking results. The FAD-binding pocket of LSD1 is a deep and narrow crevice in the interior of the protein and is surrounded by hydrophobic amino acid residues. Thus the hydrophobic character of the compounds may play an important role in the random walk of the compound into the active site.","Based on the selection criteria discussed above, 121 structurally distinct compounds were procured and submitted for biochemical screening against LSD1. The biochemical assay, as described in the experimental section, measures HOproduced from the oxidative demethylation of a peptide substrate. From the 121 compounds, a series of related compounds, which showed potent activity in the biochemical assay, were identified. Docking scores, ranks, and accompanying biochemical assay results for the series are presented in Tables 1, 2, and 6-9.","Of the ten active compounds in Table 1 (and associated tables providing biochemical and cellular data, Tables 6, 8, and 9), that were discovered using virtual screening methods, e.g. compounds 1, 2, 4 and 5 showed similar binding modes within the FAD-binding site of LSD1. Additionally, the docking scores for compounds 1, 2, 4 and 5 correlated well with the observed biochemical activity. These results suggested that improved inhibitors targeted toward the adenine dinucleotide pocket in the amine oxidase domain of LSD1 were accessible.","The Glide scores are predictive and correlated well with compounds having p-OH or m-Cl aryl substitutions (compounds 1 and 5). It is clear from these studies that the hydrophobic electron withdrawing groups such as \u2014Cl are tolerated, whereas small alkyl substituents such as methyl (e.g. compound 8) or fused bicyclic containing compound 10 have lower activity. Introduction of any donating groups particularly the \u2014OCHfunctional group at the 2position lost activity due to lack of Gly314 H-bonding interactions (e.g. compound 6). The lack of biochemical activity of compound 6 was highly predictive from docking scores, where ICM and Glide provided \u221218.39 and \u22126.63 kcal\/mol energies respectively. In subsequent docking analysis, additional benzohydrazine series of compounds were identified, with hydrazine \u2014C methyl or aryl 4-substituted sulfone containing compounds, as exemplified by the virtual hit compound 9, which exhibited potent LSD1 inhibition activity with an ICof 19 nM. The low docking score of compound 9 is primarily due to the shift in 2-OH aryl ring position. Compound 9, with a sulfone\/morpholine substituent, was chosen as a backbone for further optimization due, in part, to its chemical stability.","The binding mode of compound 12 with the sulfone\/morpholine is depicted with the docking pose predicted from ICM in Figure 1. In this model, the phenolic group fits well in the pocket composed of residues Ser289, Gly314 and Arg316. The central carbonyl group appears to be involved in strong H-bonding interactions with Arg310 amino group and the morpholine oxygen shows H-bonding interactions with Val 590. These sets of hydrogen bonding interactions were also observed with Glide and GOLD docking experiments. The additional experiments showed the morpholine substituted aryl ring participating in \u03c0-\u03c0 interactions with Trp756 residue while the morpholine oxygen retained in H-bonding with Val590.","Chemical optimization also focused on the design of compounds containing heteroaryl rings on either side of compound 12. Computational models using these results generated a variety of chemically plausible scaffolds, from which a substituted pyridine was identified as being an appropriate moiety capable of interacting with Ser289, Gly314 and Arg316, surrounding residues and ideal properties. A representative is compound 24, which had potent LSD1 activity of (28 nM) and also exhibited a similar binding mode to that of compound 12 (see Figure 2).","Many of the representative compounds contain a C-alkyl hydrazine to increase metabolic stability of the series. However, a bulkier group, like the ethyl group of compound 21, isn't well accommodated by the binding pocket as illustrated in different biochemical activities of compounds 12 and 21. Aryl substitution with methylsulfone (compound 25) and substituted with a morpholine ring (compound 12) increased biochemical efficacy by roughly an order of magnitude when compared to compound 11. Addition of only a morpholine ring maintains some biochemical activity as illustrated by compound 23. Replacing the sulfono-morpholine with sulfono-N-dimethyl also maintained biochemical activity as illustrated by compound 18. Additionally, replacement of the 2-OH group with a chloro was found not to be well accommodated and a significant drop in activity was demonstrated between compounds 12 and 16. Results with compound 24 suggest that using a substituted pyridine is accommodated by the enzyme, but various other substitutions and heterocycles generally resulted in a drop in biochemical activity as illustrated in compounds 13, 14, 15, 17, 19, 20 and 22.","Many of the representative compounds in Table 2 contained a C-alkyl hydrazine to increase metabolic stability of the series. However, a bulkier group, e.g. the ethyl group of compound 21, is less well accommodated by the binding pocket as illustrated in the different biochemical activities of compounds 12 and 21. The aryl substitution with methylsulfone (e.g. compound 25) and substituted with a morpholine ring (compound 12) increased biochemical efficacy by roughly an order of magnitude when compared to compound 11. Addition of a heterocycle, e.g. a morpholine ring, maintains biochemical activity as illustrated by compound 23. Replacing the sulfono-morpholine with sulfono-N-dimethyl also maintained biochemical activity as illustrated by compound 18. Additionally, replacement of the 2-OH group with a chloro was found not to be accommodated with a significant drop in activity between compounds 12 and 16. As discussed above, compound 24 suggests that using a substituted pyridine is accommodated by the enzyme. Further analysis suggests that the hydroxyl of compound 12 is associated with increased biochemical activity, e.g. when this substituent group is substituted with a chlorine (compound 16), activity was decreased.",{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0272","num":"0271"},"tables":{"@attributes":{"id":"TABLE-US-00001","num":"00001"},"table":{"@attributes":{"frame":"none","colsep":"0","rowsep":"0","pgwide":"1"},"tgroup":[{"@attributes":{"align":"left","colsep":"0","rowsep":"0","cols":"5"},"colspec":[{"@attributes":{"colname":"1","colwidth":"14pt","align":"center"}},{"@attributes":{"colname":"2","colwidth":"210pt","align":"center"}},{"@attributes":{"colname":"3","colwidth":"28pt","align":"center"}},{"@attributes":{"colname":"4","colwidth":"28pt","align":"center"}},{"@attributes":{"colname":"5","colwidth":"28pt","align":"center"}}],"thead":{"row":[{"entry":"TABLE

(\u201cMD\u201d) simulations were carried out using the two different docking poses of compound 12 to determine if there was a preference for one docking pose over another. These data can better inform which interactions play a role in the results obtained with the compounds synthesized. The docking results show the higher ranked pose with compound 12 bound into the dinucleotide binding pocket via direct H-bond interactions with Ser289 or Arg316 via its hydroxyl moiety (binding mode 1, see Figure 3 and Table 3). However, there is another pose favorably scored with the morpholine ring of compound 12 interacting with Ser289 and Arg316 (binding mode 2, see Figure 3 and Table 3).","MD using the AMBER suite was used to evaluate the energetics of binding for both predicted binding modes. Simulations for binding mode 1 showed Tr-conjugated electron interactions between compound 12 and Arg 316 as well as potential for hydrogen bonding between the hydroxyl and Ser289. Analysis of binding mode 2 showed potential \u03c0-\u03c0 interactions between compound 12 and Trp756 with more favorable hydrogen bonds with Arg310 and Arg316. Further, binding mode 1 is predicted to have hydrogen bonding with Val590 while binding mode two has van der Waals interactions involving the chloro group. MMPBSA analysis of the final 100 ps of simulation showed that binding mode 2 was predicted to have a free energy of binding of \u02dc\u221240.8 kcal\/mol, which is nearly 20 kcal\/mol more favorable than \u02dc\u221221.0 for binding mode 1. The first 100 ps of simulation likely reflect in part the equilibration of the complex such that the calculated free energies of binding are not as favorable. This finding contrasts with the rankings of the binding poses during the docking process. It is possible that this difference arises from differences in the protein structure during docking and MD, with a rigid structure used to increase the speed of the docking protocol and a flexible structure used for MD.",{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0276","num":"0275"},"tables":{"@attributes":{"id":"TABLE-US-00003","num":"00003"},"table":{"@attributes":{"frame":"none","colsep":"0","rowsep":"0"},"tgroup":[{"@attributes":{"align":"left","colsep":"0","rowsep":"0","cols":"3"},"colspec":[{"@attributes":{"colname":"1","colwidth":"77pt","align":"left"}},{"@attributes":{"colname":"2","colwidth":"63pt","align":"center"}},{"@attributes":{"colname":"3","colwidth":"77pt","align":"center"}}],"thead":{"row":[{"entry":"TABLE 3"},{"entry":{"@attributes":{"namest":"1","nameend":"3","align":"center","rowsep":"1"}}},{"entry":[{},"Compound No. 12","Compound No. 12"]},{"entry":["MD","(Binding Mode 1)","(Binding Mode 2)"]},{"entry":{"@attributes":{"namest":"1","nameend":"3","align":"center","rowsep":"1"}}}]},"tbody":{"@attributes":{"valign":"top"},"row":{"entry":{}}}},{"@attributes":{"align":"left","colsep":"0","rowsep":"0","cols":"3"},"colspec":[{"@attributes":{"colname":"1","colwidth":"77pt","align":"left"}},{"@attributes":{"colname":"2","colwidth":"63pt","align":"char","char":"."}},{"@attributes":{"colname":"3","colwidth":"77pt","align":"char","char":"."}}],"tbody":{"@attributes":{"valign":"top"},"row":[{"entry":["1-100 ps:","\u221220.2154","\u221232.9117"]},{"entry":"\u0394G-bind (kcal\/mol)"},{"entry":["101-200 ps:","\u221221.0263","\u221240.8046"]},{"entry":"\u0394G-bind (kcal\/mol)"},{"entry":["150-200 ps:","0.394","1.560"]},{"entry":"ligand RMSD (\u212b)"},{"entry":{"@attributes":{"namest":"1","nameend":"3","align":"center","rowsep":"1"}}}]}}]}}},{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0277","num":"0276"},"chemistry":{"@attributes":{"id":"CHEM-US-00041","num":"00041"},"img":{"@attributes":{"id":"EMI-C00041","he":"20.74mm","wi":"50.97mm","file":"US08987335-20150324-C00041.TIF","alt":"embedded image","img-content":"chem","img-format":"tif"}}}},"1-(5-Chloro-2-hydroxyphenyl)ethanone (100 mg, 0.586 mmol) and benzohydrazide (80 mg, 0.586 mmol) were dissolved in methanol (4 mL) in the presence of acetic acid as a catalyst, and then the reaction mixture was heated via microwave irradiation to 120\u00b0 C. for 30 min.

The LSD1 enzyme stock was diluted 17-fold with assay buffer and 40 \u03bcM of the diluted LSD1 enzyme was added to the appropriate wells. The reaction mixture comprised horseradish peroxidase, dimethyl K4 peptide (corresponding to the first 21 amino acids of the N-terminal tail of histone H3), and 10-acetyl-3,7-dihydroxyphenoxazine was then added to wells. Generation of resorufin (generated by reacting with HOproduced in the reaction) was analyzed on an Envision microplate reader with an excitation wavelength of 530 nm and an emission wavelength of 595 nm.","Inhibition of monoamine oxidase activity was carried used using the MAO-Glo\u2122 Assay Kit according to the manufacturer's suggested protocol. Briefly, 6.25 \u03bcL of test compound was added to each well of a 384-well plate. Enzyme (either MAO A or B) was added (12.5 \u03bcL in 2\u00d7 buffer containing 1 \u03bcg protein) and allowed to incubate for 5 minutes. Finally, 6.25 \u03bcL of 4\u00d7MAO substrate was added to each well. Following a one hour incubation, 25 \u03bcL of Luciferin detection reagent was added to each well, and incubated for 20 minutes. Luminescence was then measured on an Envision microplate reader. Representative data used to determine ICfor inhibition of each MAO isoform is provided in Figure 4, and representative data for several compounds is summarized in Table 8 below.","Cell viability was determined using ATPlite\u2122 Luminescence Assay System (PerkinElmer Inc., Waltham, Mass.) using the various cell-lines described above and in Table 4. Briefly, cells were seeded in 96-well plates and then treated with different concentrations of inhibitor (0.1% final DMSO concentration). After 96-hours of incubation, ATPlite detection reagent was added directly to the culture well. Luminescence was read 5 minutes later on an Envision microplate reader. Representative ICdata for inhibition of cell growth with various cell-lines is provided below in Tables 6, 7, and 9.","Briefly, T-47D cells were seeded in 96-well plates and treated with concentrations of inhibitors as indicated. Cell lysates, Reverse transcription, and single color syber green realtime PCR was performed using the Cells-to-Ct kit (Life Technologies). Transcript levels of heme oxygenase (HMOX) were normalized to hypoxanthine phosphoribosyltransferase (HPRT) and \u03b2-actin.

The data were entered as an X-Y plot into the software as percent inhibition for each concentration of the drug. The concentration values of the drug were log transformed and the nonlinear regression was carried out using the \u201csigmoidal dose-response (variable slope)\u201d option within the GraphPad software to model the data and calculate ICvalues. The ICvalues reported are the concentration of drug at which 50% inhibition was reached.","The ability of representative disclosed compounds to modulate various biochemical and cellular activities was determined using the assays described above. The results are shown in the tables below. The IC(\u03bcM) for inhibition of either LSD1 activity or cell growth using T-47D cells is shown in Tables 6 and 7. In addition, the effect of representative compounds on heme oxygenase (HMOX) expression is also shown in Tables 6 and 7. The ICfor inhibition of monoamine oxidases A (\u201cMAO A\u201d) and B (\u201cMAO B\u201d) by representative compounds compared to a control compound, tranylcypromine, is shown in Table 8. The effect of Compound No. 12 (in reference to the compound number used in Table 7, or (E)-N\u2032-(1-(5-chloro-2-hydroxyphenyl)ethylidene)-3-(morpholinosulfonyl)benzohydrazide) on cell growth for various cell-lines in shown in Table 9. If an ICor other assay result is indicated as \u201cn.d.\u201d, it was not determined in the indicated assay.","Compound 12 was used to evaluate sensitivity in a panel of cancer cell lines (Table 9). Cell line sensitivity to compound 12 in this viability assay varied by one log, with ICvalues around 300 nM to just under 3 \u03bcM. For comparison among the representative compounds, ICvalues were determined in T-47D cells (see Tables 6 and 7). With few exceptions, it was observed that T-47D cells were sensitive to test compounds that were active in the LSD1 biochemical assay, and were less sensitive to the compounds which showed less activity in the LSD1 assay.","In order to add an additional level of analysis of LSD1 inhibition in cell culture by these compounds, expression array experiments were performed to evaluate transcriptional changes induced by compound 12 (data not shown). These data indicated that heme oxygenase 1 (HMOX1) was one of the most consistently up-regulated genes across multiple cell lines following treatment with this compound. As HMOX1 is known to be regulated by H3 methylation in the promoter (Krieg, A. J., et al. 2010, 30 (1), 344-53), the effect of the test compounds on HMOX1 expression in T-47D cells was determined (see Tables 6 and 7). The data show that the representative compounds which are associated with upregulation of HMOX1 expression are also associated inhibitory activity in the LSD1 assay and the cell viability assay.","LSD1 has a high structural homology of to the monoamine oxidase family of enzymes (17.6% for both monoamine oxidase A and B; MAO A and B, respectively; e.g. see Gooden, D. M., et al. 2008, 18 (10), 3047-51). Selective activity of the representative compounds for LSD1 compared to either MAO A or MAO B, is a desirable property for therapeutic compounds targeting LSD1. The specificity of compound 1 and compound 12 were tested in MAO biochemical assays described herein (see Figure 3 for representative results which are summarized in Table 8). In this assay, the known MAO inhibitor tranylcypromine exhibited activity against both MAO A and B. In contrast, compound 1 exhibited comparable activity to tranylcypromine against MAO B, but showed no activity against MAO A. However, compound 12 does not exhibit activity against either MAO enzyme (>300 \u03bcM). Compounds 18 and 24 were also tested, and exhibited no activity against MAO A or B, and the results are provided in Table 8. These results demonstrate that the representative compounds have specificity for LSD1 with significantly reduced effect on the MAO enzymes. It should be noted that both MAO A and B differ from LSD1 in that the FAD is covalently bound to the enzyme through a thioether linkage with Cys406 and Cys397, respectively (Kearney, E. B., et al. 1971, (24), 321-327; and Bach, A. W., et al. 1988, (85), 4934-4938).",{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0410","num":"0409"},"tables":{"@attributes":{"id":"TABLE-US-00006","num":"00006"},"table":{"@attributes":{"frame":"none","colsep":"0","rowsep":"0","pgwide":"1"},"tgroup":[{"@attributes":{"align":"left","colsep":"0","rowsep":"0","cols":"5"},"colspec":[{"@attributes":{"colname":"1","colwidth":"14pt","align":"center"}},{"@attributes":{"colname":"2","colwidth":"210pt","align":"center"}},{"@attributes":{"colname":"3","colwidth":"35pt","align":"center"}},{"@attributes":{"colname":"4","colwidth":"35pt","align":"center"}},{"@attributes":{"colname":"5","colwidth":"35pt","align":"center"}}],"thead":{"row":[{"entry":"TABLE

following example of the in vivo effect of the disclosed compounds are prophetic. Generally agents which modulate the regulation of chromatin, including histone demethylase inhibitors, display efficacy in preclinical models of cancer. In vivo effects of the compounds described in the preceding examples are expected to be shown in various animal models of cancer known to the skilled person, such as tumor xenograft models. These models are typically conducted in rodent, most often in mouse, but may be conducted in other animal species as is convenient to the study goals. Compounds, products, and compositions disclosed herein are expected to show in vivo effects in various animal models of cancer known to the skilled person, such as mouse tumor xenograft models.","In vivo effects of compounds can be assessed with in a mouse tumor xenograft study, one possible study protocol is described herein. Briefly, cells (2 to 5\u00d710in 100 mL culture media) were implanted subcutaneously, e.g. by subcutaneous injection, in the right hind flank of athymic nu\/nu nude mice (5 to 6 weeks old, 18-22 g). For test compounds of the present invention, a typical cell-line used for the tumor xenograft study would be AN3 CA or BT-20. Other suitable cell-lines for these studies are BT-549, HCT 116, HER218, MCF7, MDA-MB-231, MDA-MB-235, MDA-MB-435S, MDA-MB-468, PANC-1, PC-3, SK-N-MC, T-47D, and U-87 MG cells. The cells are cultured prior to harvesting for this protocol as described herein.","Following implantation, the tumors are allowed to grow to about 100 mm, typically about 6-18 days post-implantation, before the animals are randomized into treatment groups (e.g. vehicle, positive control and various dose levels of the test compound); the number of animals per group is typically 8-12. Day 1 of study corresponds to the day that the animals receive their first dose. The efficacy of a test compound can be determined in studies of various length dependent upon the goals of the study. Typical study periods are for 14, 21 and 28-days. The dosing frequency (e.g. whether animals are dosed with test compound daily, every other day, every third day or other frequencies) is determined for each study depending upon the toxicity and potency of the test compound. A typical study design would involve dosing daily (M-F) with the test compound with recovery on the weekend. Throughout the study, tumor volumes and body weights are measured twice a week. At the end of the study the animals are euthanized and the tumors harvested and frozen for further analysis. Alternatively, tumors may be processed immediately for analysis, e.g. fixed in buffered-formalin, paraffin embedded, and sectioned for hematoxylin\/eosin staining and further immunohistochemical analysis for desired oncology markers.","For example, compounds of the invention, or a pharmaceutically acceptable salt, solvate, polymorph, hydrate and the stereochemically isomeric form thereof, are expected to show such in vivo effects.","Alternatively, it can be desirable to assess the in vivo efficacy of the disclosed compounds in a tumor explant or tumor graft animal models (e.g. see Rubio-Viqueira B., et al. . (2006) 12:4652-4661; Fiebig, H. H., Maier, A. and Burger, A. M. . (2004) 40:802-820; and DeRose, Y. S., et al. \u201cPatient-derived tumor grafts authentically reflect tumor pathology, growth, metastasis and disease outcomes.\u201d (2011) ., in press). These models can provide higher quality information on in vivo effects of therapeutic compounds. It is believed tumor graft models are more authentic in vivo models of many types of cancer, e.g. human breast cancer, with which to examine the biology of tumors and how they metastasize. Engraftment of actual patient tumor tissues into immunodeficient mice (termed \u2018tumor grafts\u2019) provides improvement over implantation of cell lines, in terms of phenocopying human tumors and predicting drug responses in patients (Clarke, R. (2009) 11 Suppl 3, S22; Press, J. Z., et al. (2008) 110:56-264; Kim, M. P., et al. (2009) 4:670-1680; Daniel, V. C., et al. (2009) 69:3364-3373; and Ding, L., et al. (2010) 464:999-1005).","Briefly, tissue samples will be collected from informed, consented patients at Huntsman Cancer Hospital\/University of Utah under an approved IRB protocol. Samples will be collected and de\u25a1identified by the Huntsman Cancer Institute Tissue Resource and Application Core facility before being obtained for implantation. It is anticipated that all primary tumors will be from individuals that had not received chemotherapy prior to tissue collection, and all metastatic effusions will be from individuals that had been treated with chemotherapy, hormone therapy, and\/or radiation therapy. The University of Utah Institutional Animal Care and Use Committee will review and approve all mouse experiments. It is anticipated that a minimum of three mice per experimental group will be used, and only female mice will be used for studies involving breast cancer tumors. A single fragment of fresh or frozen tumor (\u02dc8 mm3), or about 10cells in matrigel, is implanted into cleared inguinal mammary fat pads of 3-4 week old female NOD\/SCID mice. At the same, interscapular estrogen pellets are subcutaneously implanted in mice with ER+ tumors. Tumor growth is measured weekly using calipers. When tumors reach about 150-2,000 mm, the mice are euthanized, and tissue fragments are re-transplanted into another cohort of mice, frozen for later use, and\/or analyzed for histology, gene expression, and DNA copy number. Tumor volumes are calculated using the formula 0.5\u00d7length\u00d7(width). For experiments to determine estrogen dependence, ER tumors are implanted into mice as described above, in the presence or absence of intrascapular estrogen pellets and with or without a concurrent surgical procedure to remove the ovaries, which is performed according to standard methods.","Freshly harvested tumor tissues from patients or mice are cut into \u02dc8 mm3 pieces and stored in liquid nitrogen, in a solution of 95% FBS and 5% DMSO for later implantation. Alternatively, the tissue is digested with collagenase solution (1 mg\/ml collagenase [Type IV, Sigma] in RPMI 1640 supplemented with 2.5% FBS, 10 mM HEPES, 10 \u03bcg\/mL penicillin-streptomycin) at 37\u00b0 C. for 40-60 min, while shaking at 250 rpm. Digested tissue is strained to remove debris and washed in human breast epithelial cell (HBEC) medium (DMEM F\/12 supplemented with 10 mM HEPES, 5% FBS, 1 mg\/mL BSA, 0.5 \u03bcg\/mL hydrocortisone, 50 \u03bcg mL Gentamycin, 1 \u03bcg\/mL ITS-X100) three times. The pellet is resuspended in freezing medium (5% FBS and 10% DMSO in HBEC medium) and stored in liquid nitrogen.","To assess the effect of a disclosed compound, tumors in mice are allowed to grow to about 100 mm, typically about 6-18 days post-implantation, before the animals are randomized into treatment groups (e.g. vehicle, positive control and various dose levels of the test compound); the number of animals per group is typically 8-12.
