Such wireless communication is effectuated by propagating a wireless signal from a transmitter to a receiver, each of which may constitute a node of a wireless network. Nodes in a traditional cellular wireless network, for example, include fixed base stations and mobile stations. Mobile stations access the cellular wireless network via the fixed based stations. The base stations are operated by a network service provider that designs the cellular wireless network and is capable of controlling access to and\/or employing security measures in the wireless network. In other words, a single entity operates multiple base stations on a large-scale basis and can therefore provide a degree of organization and a measure of security, as well as a level of overall network management for the cellular wireless network.","Other types of wireless networks, such as spontaneous wireless networks, do not ordinarily entail such large-scale planning, organization, or management. For example, ad hoc wireless networks are created by multiple devices that mutually decide to join together to form nodes of a wireless network, generally without prior or subsequent explicit agreement among owners of the multiple devices. Hence, there is no overarching operator or other entity to enforce network access rules, handle security issues, monitor standards-based requirements, or guarantee generally-accepted wireless network behavior. Legitimate and illegitimate participants of such ad hoc networks can therefore act carelessly, indiscriminately, or even maliciously without being subject to significant restraints or any real repercussions.","Accordingly, there is a need for schemes and\/or techniques that can introduce a degree of control and\/or accountability into spontaneously-formed wireless networks.","In an exemplary method implementation, a method includes: designating a neighborhood administrator; receiving notification of a delinquent router from the designated neighborhood administrator; and excluding the delinquent router responsive to the notification. In an exemplary mesh router implementation, a mesh router is capable of establishing a wireless mesh network with other mesh routers, the mesh router is further capable of designating a neighborhood administrator mesh router; and the mesh router is adapted to exclude another mesh router that is associated with a particular certificate when the particular certificate has been identified as delinquent by the designated neighborhood administrator mesh router. In an exemplary media implementation, one or more processor-accessible media include processor-executable instructions that, when executed, direct a device to perform actions including: receiving notification of a delinquent mesh router certificate from a neighborhood administrator as designated by the device, the delinquent mesh router certificate signed by an entity other than the neighborhood administrator; and excluding the delinquent mesh router certificate responsive to the notification received from the neighborhood administrator.","Other method, system, approach, apparatus, router, device, media, procedure, arrangement, etc. implementations are described herein.",{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0021","num":"0020"},"figref":"FIG. 1","b":["100","102","100","104","104","102"]},"As illustrated, five mesh routers (A), (B), (C), (D), and (E) form the mesh router network so as to realize at least a portion of a multi-hop wireless network. However, two or more mesh routers  (possibly tens, hundreds, thousands, etc.) may form the mesh router network. Each mesh router  is capable of communicating wirelessly using, for example, a wireless transmitter and\/or receiver (e.g., a transceiver).","Mesh router (A) has a wireless link AB with mesh router (B) and a wireless link AD with mesh router (D). Mesh router (B) additionally has wireless links BC and BE with mesh routers (C) and (E), respectively. Similarly, mesh router (C) is also in wireless communication with mesh router (E) over wireless link CE, and mesh router (E) is also in wireless communication with mesh router (D) over wireless link DE.","Although each mesh router  is illustrated as being in wireless communication with from one to three end devices , each may alternatively be in communication with any number of end devices . Mesh router (A) is in wireless communication with two end devices (A) and (A) over wireless links (A) and (A), respectively. Mesh router (B) is in wireless communication with one end device (B) over wireless link (B). Mesh router (C) is in wireless communication with two end devices (C) and (C) over wireless links (C) and (C), respectively. Similarly, mesh router (E) has wireless links (E) with three end devices (E), (E), and (E). Mesh router (D) has wireless links (D) and (D) to two end devices (D) and (D), respectively.","In a described implementation, mesh routers  comprise a relatively standard set of devices from an operational perspective. For example, each mesh router  may have similar (or even identical) hardware and\/or software. The hardware is capable of wireless communication and of executing the software (including firmware).","Mesh routers  are designed and\/or manufactured by an entity to have at least a baseline set of interoperable capabilities. For example, a first production may result in identical mesh routers  from both a hardware and a software perspective for a first version. Available (e.g., software including firmware) upgrades may result in second and subsequent versions that offer optional additional capabilities. A second production may result in mesh routers  of later versions that differ from previous versions but are still backwards compatible. In short, the entity producing mesh routers  has some measure of determination regarding the hardware and software components thereof.","In contradistinction, end devices  comprise a relatively diverse set of devices that may have arbitrary hardware and software with haphazard operational capabilities. Each of end devices  may be a laptop, a mobile phone, a personal digital assistant (PDA), a home computer, an entertainment or other appliance, and so forth. End devices  may be executing any of a variety of operating systems, applications, managed program coding, and so forth. While otherwise diverse, such end devices  are capable of accessing wireless mesh network  using an accepted protocol via a mesh router .","An entity that is producing mesh routers  creates them such that a stable and predictable mesh router network is relatively automatically established. The stability and predictability of the wireless mesh router network is, of course, limited by the vagaries of wireless communication as impacted by distance between transmitter and receiver, interference, changes to the wireless medium, and so forth. Nevertheless, when a mesh router  is activated, it attempts to join a wireless mesh network  by communicating with any mesh routers  that are in range. Establishing wireless mesh network  is described further below with particular reference to . Because the entity that is producing mesh routers  determines their operational capabilities, malicious or otherwise inappropriate network behavior can be reduced to some extent.","End devices , on the other hand, may be capable of practically arbitrary and\/or systematic malicious actions because their operational capabilities are not centrally controlled. However, the actions of end devices  can be curtailed to some extent because end devices  connect to wireless mesh network  through a mesh router , as indicated by wireless links . It should be noted that the wireless access protocols governing (i) wireless links  for end device -to-mesh router  communications and (ii) wireless links  for intra-mesh router  communications may be the same or different.","By way of example, if end device (A) is attempting to send a communication to end device (C), end device (A) transmits the communication to mesh router (A) over wireless link (A). Mesh router (A) routes the communication to mesh router (C) via mesh router (B) or mesh routers (D) and (E). Mesh router (C) then transmits the communication over wireless link (C) to end device (C).","As illustrated, end device (C) comprises a resource (C). Although only one resource  is shown, multiple resources  may be present in wireless mesh network  at the same or different mesh router(s) . Each resource  may be, for example, a local server or repository of information (e.g., for a subdivision), an Internet access point (ITap), a collection of multimedia data (e.g., that is of interest to a small community), and so forth.",{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0032","num":"0031"},"figref":"FIG. 2","b":["102","202","102","102","102","102","202","204","206","208","202","210","212","204","102"]},"In a described implementation for mesh router (A), the producing entity is associated with a signing key (not shown) and root key  that together form a public-private key pair for the producing entity. The producing entity signs certificate (A) with the private signing key to create signature (A) by performing an operation on name-A (A). Certificate (A) certifies that public key (A) is bound to name-A (A), which is the name of mesh router (A). Name-A (A) may be, for example, a serial number of mesh router (A).","Certificate (A) represents that mesh router (A) is a valid mesh router  that is certified by the producing entity associated with root key . Certificate (A) therefore indicates that mesh router (A) should be allowed to join wireless mesh network  (of ). In addition to certificate (A), mesh router (A) includes (e.g., stores) public key (A), private key (A), and root key (A). Private key (A) corresponds to public key (A), and together they form a public-private key pair that is associated with mesh router (A). Root key (A) is a copy, which is stored at mesh router (A), of the producing entity's root key .","In short, each mesh router  \u201cships\u201d with an associated certificate . Hence, mesh router \u201cB\u201d (B) includes a certificate (B), and mesh router \u201cC\u201d (C) includes a certificate (C). Certificate (B) includes name-B (B), signature (B), and public key (B) to indicate that mesh router (B) is a valid mesh router  from the producing entity and that it is bound to the private key (B) that corresponds to public key (B). Likewise, certificate (C) includes name-C (C), signature (C), and public key (C) to indicate that mesh router (C) is a valid mesh router  from the producing entity and that it is bound to the private key (C) that corresponds to public key (C).","When a mesh router  is activated, it attempts to contact other mesh routers  to establish (e.g., join) a wireless mesh network . When an activated mesh router  contacts another mesh router , the activated mesh router  and the other mesh router  perform an authentication\/key exchange protocol. The two mesh routers  exchange certificates to indicate to each other that each is a valid mesh router  from the producing entity via a signature verification procedure using root key .","One or both mesh routers  then use the public key  of the other to establish a secret symmetric key that only the activated mesh router  and the other mesh router  share. The secret key may be established via a key transfer procedure or a key agreement procedure. The shared secret key is then used to authenticate each mesh router  to the other. The shared secret key may also be used to ensure confidentiality of information in a communication between the two mesh routers .","By way of example with mesh router (A), after being activated, it looks for and finds other mesh routers  that are in range and that are potential neighbors. With respect to mesh router (B), mesh routers (A) and (B) exchange certificates (A) and (B). After a secret key establishment procedure, key AB  is created and shared between mesh routers (A) and (B).","At mesh router (A), key AB (A) is stored in association with\/mapped to mesh router \u201cB\u201d. These mesh router-key mappings may be stored, for example, in a data structure. At mesh router (B), key AB (B) is stored in association with\/mapped to mesh router \u201cA\u201d. Key AB  may be used to authenticate mesh router (A) to mesh router (B), and vice versa, as well as optionally to ensure confidentiality of communication contents via encryption.","Likewise, mesh routers (A) and (C) exchange certificates (A) and (C). After a secret key establishment procedure, key AC  is created and shared between mesh routers (A) and (C). Key AC (A) is mapped to mesh router \u201cC\u201d at mesh router (A), and key AC (C) is mapped to mesh router \u201cA\u201d at mesh router (C). This authentication\/key exchange protocol and key establishment procedure between mesh routers (A) and (C) may occur over the mesh router network portion of wireless mesh network  (e.g., via one or more mesh routers  such as mesh router (B)) even when mesh routers (A) and (C) are not within wireless range of each other. Similarly, after an exchange of certificates (B) and (C) and a secret key establishment procedure, key BC  is created and shared between mesh routers (B) and (C). Key BC (B) is mapped to mesh router \u201cC\u201d at mesh router (B), and key BC (C) is mapped to mesh router \u201cB\u201d at mesh router (C).",{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0041","num":"0040"},"figref":"FIG. 3","b":["302","102","302","102","302","102","102","104","102","102","302"]},"Because packet  is being sent to mesh router (B) from mesh router (A), mesh router (A) looks up mesh router \u201cB\u201d in a data structure (e.g., a table) and ascertains the secret key that is shared between them. In this example, the shared secret key that mesh router (A) retrieves is key AB (A). Mesh router (A) therefore uses key AB (A) to create MAC-AB (AB). MAC-AB (AB) is then tagged onto packet  prior to transmission. Upon reception of packet , mesh router (B) accesses its secret key data structure at an entry for mesh router \u201cA\u201d to retrieve the shared secret key that is mapped thereto, which is key AB (B). Mesh router (B) uses key AB (B) along with MAC-AB (AB) to authenticate that packet  was sent from mesh router (A), which is a valid and uncompromised mesh router .","In this example, packet  is ultimately destined for resource (C) at end device (C), which is coupled to (and may be considered part of) wireless mesh network  at mesh router (C). Mesh router (B), having a routing capability for wireless mesh network , determines that packet  is to be sent to mesh router (C). Mesh router (B) therefore ascertains that key BC (B) is mapped to mesh router \u201cC\u201d and utilizes key BC (B) to create MAC-BC (BC). MAC-BC (BC) is tagged onto packet  and transmitted to mesh router (C). Mesh router (C) uses its stored key BC (C) to authenticate that packet  is received from a known and trusted mesh router (B).","Authentication is thusly performed on a hop-by-hop basis. Confidentiality (e.g., via encryption) of the information contents of a communication may also be performed on a hop-by-hop basis with each communication being encrypted by the shared secret key of each pair of adjacent mesh routers . Alternatively, encryption may be performed on an end-to-end basis. For example, because mesh routers (A) and (C) established a shared secret key AC , the contents of packet  may be encrypted using key AC . Consequently, intervening mesh routers  such as mesh router (B) are not able to understand the contents of packet  as it is routed through wireless mesh network  with end-to-end encryption.",{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0045","num":"0044"},"figref":"FIG. 4","b":["100","100","102","404"]},"As illustrated in , mesh router (A) has also established shared secret key AD  with mesh router (D). Key AD (A) is mapped to mesh router \u201cD\u201d at mesh router (A), and key AD (D) is mapped to mesh router \u201cA\u201d at mesh router (D). The ellipses included in each mesh router-to-secret key mapping data structure represent the possible presence of additional entries. Such additional entries may be directed to other mesh routers  that are illustrated in  and other mesh routers  that are not specifically included in .","In a described implementation, mesh router (C) presents or offers itself as a neighborhood administrator  for a number of mesh routers  in wireless mesh network . Each mesh router  has a personal administrator (not shown) such as the owner thereof that manages the functioning of the respective mesh router  within the confines (hopefully) of permitted capabilities originally provided and enabled by the producing entity.","Each personal administrator of a mesh router  may select for designation a neighborhood administrator. Although not so illustrated in , the neighborhood administrator may not be physically located in the neighborhood being administered; for example, the neighborhood administrator may actually be an internet service. Regardless of physical location, the neighborhood administrator is to be trusted to manage the local neighborhood with respect to at least a subset of management decisions. This subset of management decisions includes the exclusion of a delinquent mesh router \/certificate  as is described further below with particular reference to . The size of the local neighborhood may be bounded by a predetermined (but alterable) number of hops from the neighborhood administrator.","In the example of , mesh router (C) is an available neighborhood administrator . Mesh routers (A), (B), (D), and (E) each designate mesh router \u201cC\u201d as the neighborhood administrator at A, B, D, and E, respectively. Consequently, until the neighborhood administrator designation is revoked, mesh routers (A), (B), (D), and (E) defer to mesh router (C) for the subset of management decisions. Optionally, each respective individual personal administrator may further identify selected ones of the subset of management decisions to which the respective mesh router  is to defer.",{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0050","num":"0049"},"figref":"FIG. 5","b":["102","102","202","102"]},"In a described implementation, delinquent behavior includes, but is not limited to: (i) transmitting at more than an allowed rate; (ii) attempting to send more than a maximum number of allowed packets over the mesh network in a given time period; (iii) refusing to communicate with a valid mesh router; (iv) dropping, including not forwarding, legitimate packets; (v) launching attacks against the network; (vi) a combination thereof; and so forth. Optionally, a local neighborhood and\/or neighborhood administrator may selectively determine activities that qualify as delinquent, especially from among a list promulgated by the producing entity. A delinquent mesh router may be discovered using, for example, secure trace route, physical measurement, traffic flow monitoring, specialized mesh management tools (e.g., statistical analysis), notifications from other neighborhood administrators, some combination thereof, and so forth.","In the example illustrated in , mesh router (A) has been discovered to be delinquent. Consequently, mesh router (C) excludes certificate (A) (of ) as indicated at (C). An exclusion indication is associated with\/mapped to mesh router \u201cA\u201d. The exclusion indication may be included in the same data structure that stores shared secret keys or a different data structure.","The producing entity originally issued certificate (A) to indicate the validity of mesh router (A) and to bind the public-private key thereof thereto. However, the exclusion of certificate (A) causes mesh router (C) (i) to consider certificate (A) to be invalid for wireless mesh network  purposes and (ii) to refuse to route traffic from the associated mesh router (A).","Mesh router (C) as neighborhood administrator  has an ability, if not a responsibility, to propagate the exclusion determination to mesh routers  in its neighborhood.

Optionally, if such keys are not to be subsequently used e.g. for tracking purposes, key AB (B) and key AD (D) may be deleted.","As represented by the truncated wireless links AB and AD, mesh router (A) is excluded from the neighborhood for which mesh router (C) is the neighborhood administrator .

This identifier may be name\u2014A (A) (of ) or all or part of certificate (A), for example. As illustrated in , an entry (E) of a data structure of mesh router (E) maps an identifier of mesh router \u201cA\u201d to exclusion indication (E).

An elevated access scenario enables end devices  that are affiliated with a particular mesh router  of a given neighborhood to access any mesh router  of the given neighborhood at the preferred access level.

If data structure  includes mesh routers  that have been excluded, then mesh router (E) also checks to ensure that mesh router (B) has not been excluded.","Because mesh router (B) is a member of the neighborhood of mesh router (C) and is thus listed in neighborhood members data structure , mesh router (E) analyzes certificate (B). If mesh router (E) and mesh router (B) have previously performed a certificate exchange\/key establishment procedure and if mesh router (E) stored a copy of certificate (B), mesh router (E) may merely compare the stored copy of certificate (B) to the copy of certificate (B) provided by end device (B) to ensure the legitimacy of certificate (B). If not, then mesh router (E) performs a signature verification procedure on certificate (B) using its stored root key (E) (not explicitly illustrated) to validate certificate (B).","After mesh router (E) ascertains that mesh router (B) is a member of the same neighborhood and that the presented certificate (B) is legitimate\/valid, mesh router (E) analyzes certificate (B). Certificate (B) is analyzed to ensure that certificate (B) was issued by the mesh router (B) that is associated with certificate (B). Thus, mesh router (E) uses public key (B) of certificate (B) to perform a signature verification procedure on the signature of certificate (B) to verify that the signature of certificate (B) was signed by the corresponding private key (B) of neighborhood member mesh router (B).","If this signature verification procedure is successful, then mesh router (E) has determined that certificate (B) is valid and that end device (B) is affiliated with mesh router (B), which is a neighborhood member of the neighborhood of mesh router (C). Consequently, mesh router (E) grants end device (B) preferred access instead of standard access. Mesh router (E) and end device (B) may also perform a key establishment procedure to establish a shared secret key for authenticating\/encrypting communications between the two nodes.","Privileged status relates to level of service such as being entitled to preferred access instead of merely standard access. Preferred access versus standard access may respectively comprise a faster data rate versus a slower data rate, a guaranteed throughput versus a best effort throughput, a higher priority for transmission\/reception versus a lower priority for transmission\/reception, some combination thereof, and so forth. Levels of service may also include more than two different levels of service\/status.","It should be noted that preferred access versus standard access (or a greater number of different levels of service) for communicated traffic may be honored throughout wireless mesh network  by tagging traffic. For example, routers  can tag their transmitted packets by their individually determined classification (e.g., as \u201cstandard access rate\u201d or \u201cpreferred access rate\u201d). As a result, differences in packet classification can be respected throughout wireless mesh network , instead of merely at the router  where an end device  introduces the packets into wireless mesh network  and where the classification determination is made.","This exemplary recognition mechanism therefore enables an end device (B) that is affiliated with a particular mesh router (B) to be specially recognized by other mesh routers  that are members of the same neighborhood, which is administered by mesh router (C). As a result, peers (e.g., mesh routers ) of a first tier can issue certificates  hierarchically to a second different tier (e.g., to end devices ) that are recognized by other peers of the first tier.",{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0088","num":"0087"},"figref":["FIG. 10","FIGS. 2"],"b":["1000","1000","1002","1020","1002","1020","8","9","1000","102","104","1","102","102","1002","104","1","1004","1012","102","1014","1020"]},"At block , an end device connects with an affiliated mesh router.

Both of the certificates, certificate (B) and certificate (B), may be provided via wireless link (B) from mesh router (B) to end device (B).","At block , the end device certificate and the mesh router certificate are stored by the end device.

For example, end device (B) may provide certificate (B) and certificate (B) to mesh router (E). Alternatively, if mesh router (E) has stored a copy of an associated certificate  for each mesh router  in its neighborhood, end device (B) may merely send certificate (B) and an identifier of mesh router (B), which identifier may be included in certificate (B), to mesh router (E).","At block , the neighborhood mesh router ascertains if the mesh router associated with the mesh router certificate is a neighborhood member.

For example, mesh router (E) may grant standard access to end device (B).","If, on the other hand, the neighborhood mesh router does ascertain that the mesh router associated with the mesh router certificate is a neighborhood member (at block ), then the method continues at block . At block , the neighborhood mesh router determines whether the end device certificate is valid. For example, mesh router (E) may analyze certificate (B), possibly in conjunction with an analysis of certificate (B), to determine whether certificate (B) was issued by a private key (B) of a legitimate mesh router (B). This analysis may involve at least one public key (B) operation for a signature verification procedure on a signature of certificate (B).","If it is not determined that the end device certificate is valid (at block ), then standard access is granted to the end device by the neighborhood mesh router at block . If, on the other hand, the neighborhood mesh router does determine that the end device certificate is valid (at block ), then the method continues at block . At block , the neighborhood mesh router grants preferred access to the end device. For example, mesh router (E) may grant preferred access to end device (B).
