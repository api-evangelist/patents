This application is also related to U.S. patent application Ser. No. 11\/372,528, entitled SAMFLA, filed on Mar. 11, 2006. The disclosures of all referenced applications are hereby incorporated by reference in their entirety.","1. Field of the Disclosure","The present disclosure relates to listing services. In particular, it relates to systems and methods of data acquisition for listing service providers.","2. General Background","In the current generation of listing services, listing service providers use World Wide Web (web) crawlers to visit and pick-up billions of listings from every accessible source on the Internet. Typically, upon the listing service provider acquiring the listings through web crawling, the listings are processed, indexed into search banks, and published on an Internet website. Listing service providers are, for example, auction websites listing auctioned items, job databanks listing employment opportunities and openings, real estate listing companies, among others. End users, seeking specific items, are provided with an easy web search capability that allows them to extract relevant information that addresses their needs.","In addition, listers possess listing information to be conveyed to end users. Thus, for example, a lister can be any entity that sells or leases items, or provides services. Examples of listers include vehicle manufacturers and resellers, home owners, employers, etc.","Listing service providers collect data from multiple listers, classify the collected data and list the data in a searchable form so as to provide an easy to use interface for users to find the items matching the criteria of the user. Listing service providers rely heavily on the web crawlers to gather information. Listers publish listings on Internet sites utilizing different methodologies, standards, and data formats. As such, listing information obtained by web crawlers is generally unstructured and in a non-standardized format. Therefore, undirected web crawling is not completely reliable because the methodology results in poor-quality listings. Further, filtrations systems utilized to eliminate irrelevant listings obtained through undirected web-crawling require computing power that can be more productively used in other processes.","In one aspect, the present disclosure is directed to a method of data acquisition by a listing service provider. As an example, a network address is received from a client computer that is operated by a lister. The network address can be a uniform resource locator. The network address can be indicative of a location of listing data on a computer network. The listing data comprises at least one information item provided by the lister. The network address received from the lister is accessed by opening a computer network connection to retrieve the listing data. The lister makes available the listing data for retrieval so that the listing data can be posted in a search bank hosted by the listing service provider. The listing data is retrieved from the network address using the computer network connection by copying the listing data onto a listing data database.","In a further exemplary aspect of the method, the listing data comprises job listing or real estate listings. In addition, the listing data in the listing data database can be analyzed for conformance to predetermined quality criteria. The listing data can also be categorized into one or more predetermined categories, and further stored in the search bank hosted by the listing service provider. Moreover, selected categorized job information data can be transferred from the search bank through a job search client server to a job searcher in response to a query by the job searcher. The listing data can be posted on an Internet website.","In another aspect of the method, an Internet website can be provided wherein a lister can administrate the listing data provided to the listing service provider. In yet another aspect of the method, the retrieved listing data is in an information resource definition language which is unique to the listing service provider. The information resource definition language can be based on extensible markup language.","In another aspect of the method, the information resource definition language is an extension of extensible markup language. For example, the information resource definition language can comprise a job element. In addition, the job element can comprise an employer company attribute and a job title attribute.","In another example, the information resource definition language can comprise a real estate element. In addition, the real estate element can comprise a location attribute and a price attribute.","In one embodiment, the network address can be provided by entering a uniform resource locator in an Internet web form hosted by the listing service provider. In another embodiment, the network address can be provided by transmitting the uniform resource locator as part of a hypertext source code tag.","In another aspect, an embodiment of the disclosure is a system for data acquisition by a listing service provider comprising an address receiving module and a web crawling module. The address receiving module receives a network address from a client computer that is operated by a lister. The network address is indicative of a location of listing data on a computer network. The listing data comprises at least one information item provided by the lister. The web crawling module accesses the network address received from the lister. The network address is accessed by opening a computer network connection to retrieve the listing data. The lister makes available the listing data for retrieval so that the listing data can be posted in a search bank hosted by the listing service provider. The web crawling module is configured to retrieve the listing data from the network address using the computer network connection by copying the listing data onto a listing data database.","In yet another aspect, a computer readable medium encoding a computer program of instructions for executing a computer process for data acquisition by a listing service provider. The computer process may comprise multiple steps. A network address is received from a client computer that is operated by a lister. The network address can be indicative of a location of listing data on a computer network. The listing data comprises at least one information item provided by the lister. The network address received from the lister is accessed by opening a computer network connection to retrieve the listing data. The lister makes available the listing data for retrieval so that the listing data can be posted in a search bank hosted by the listing service provider. The listing data is retrieved from the network address using the computer network connection by copying the listing data onto a listing data database.","A system and method of listing data collection and delivery is disclosed. Unlike traditional systems and methods of data acquisition, which rely on web crawling of non-standardized listing data, the system and method provided herein allows listers and listing service providers to communicate via a standard language. Thus, accurate and updated listing data can be provided to listing service providers. In addition, listers also benefit from better categorized listing data and thereby have higher chances that their listings will be easily accessed by users.","A listing service provider can utilize a directed web crawler to acquire data more accurately and efficiently. Furthermore, an Information Resource Definition (IRD) language can be utilized as a means for communication between a lister and the listing service provider.","In one embodiment, a lister can place listing data on a secure site and give to a listing service provider an indication of the location of the listing data. The listing service provider can then utilize a directed web crawler to collect the listing data at the specified location. In addition, the listing service provider can interpret the data based on standardized definitions. Therefore, a \u201cpull\u201d methodology may be used to acquire data at the listing manager. In this methodology, the lister provides to the listing service provider two pieces of information to find the data: the location of the data and the format of the data. Once the listing service provider receives this information, a directed web crawler can \u201cpull\u201d or collect the information from the specified location.","In another embodiment, listers are also provided with the capability to submit listing data to a listing service provider. Thus, a \u201cpush\u201d methodology may be used to acquire data at the listing manager. Listers can utilize the Information Resource Definition (IRD) rules and deliver or push listing data to the listing service provider. The data delivered to the listing service provider can be formatted to comply with the IRD rules such that the listing service provider can interpret the data submitted.",{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0032","num":"0031"},"figref":"FIG. 1","b":["100","101","108","102","110","108","110","101"]},"In one embodiment, the lister's computer  can include a listings database  that stores listing data ready for publication. For example, an employer having job openings in its engineering division can store job listings in the listings database  that are later transmitted to a listing service provider . The lister's computer can further include a feed module  that retrieves listing data from the listings database . In one embodiment, the feed module  delivers the retrieved listing data to the listing manager . In another embodiment, the feed module  places the retrieved listing data in a network-accessible site for the listing manager  to collect through the Internet .","The listing manager  can be a computing module, which resides in a computer infrastructure of a listing service provider . Alternatively, the listing manager  can be a computer server that resides in a computer infrastructure of a listing service provider . For example, a job listing service provider  can utilize a computer infrastructure to post all available job listings on the Internet . The listing manager  can reside in a computer server connected to the Internet . The listing data can be acquired by either requesting the data from the feed module , scraping the data published on the Internet  by the feed module , or by simply receiving the listing data submitted by the feed module .","In addition, once the listing information is acquired from the lister's computer , the listing manager  can provide the listing information to a listing server , which in turn publishes, or otherwise makes available, the listing information on the Internet . The listing server  can be for example, a web server, an ftp server, or any other server configured to post information on the Internet  for user viewing and searching.","Once published and listed, the listing data is available for users to view and search the listing data at a user computing device . The user computing device  can be any personal computer, a handheld device, etc., that can access the Internet. Upon sending a request, the user computing device  receives listing information posted by the listing server . In one embodiment, the user computing device  can receive the listing data either on a request to the listing server , wherein the user computing device  includes a web browser and requests listing data from the listing server . In another embodiment, the user computing device  receives the listing data based on a transmission by the listing server , wherein the transmission is initiated by the listing server . In one example, the user computing device  receives a Really Simple Syndication (RSS) feed. In another example, the user computing device  receives a podcast.","As previously mentioned, listers are provided the opportunity to render accurate listing data to a listing service provider  by using a common standardized format. The lister computer  allows a lister to transmit listing data to a listing service by \u201cpushing\u201d the relevant listing data to the listing manager  through the Internet . In addition, the lister computer  allows a lister to transmit the location of the listing data to a listing service so that the listing service can \u201cpull\u201d the relevant listing data and process the listing data in the listing manager .","Push Methodology","Listers can transmit listing data to a listing service provider  at any time by directly feeding the listing data. Therefore, the listing service provider  does not have to web crawl the Internet to acquire such listing information. In addition, the listing data that is provided to the lister can be in a standard format.","The lister can \u201cpush\u201d the data to the listing service provider  through interfaces provided by the listing service provider . In one example, the listing service provider  makes available a website that has data fields for entering listing data. In another example, the listing service provider  makes available a file upload site in which a lister can provide the name of a file in a pre-specified format for uploading. In yet another example, the listing service provider  provides application programming interface (APIs) functions for the lister to develop a computer application for distributing the data to the listing service provider .",{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0040","num":"0039"},"figref":"FIG. 2","b":["200","201","108","202","210","202","206","210"]},"In one embodiment, the web form provided by the feed web server  is a form having one or more fields where data can be entered. The web browser  can display the forms hosted by the feed web server  and allow the user to enter listing data in the forms.","In another embodiment, the web interface provided by the feed web server  allows a lister to designate a file containing listing data for uploading. Thus, the lister at the lister's computer  can provide a file path indicative of the location of the file to be uploaded. Files of various formats can be uploaded and later parsed by the file interpretation module . In one example, the file is an Excel spreadsheet file. In another example, the file is an Extensible Markup Language (XML) file. In yet another example, the file is a Human Resources Extensible Markup Language (XML) file. In another example, the file is a Resource Description Framework (RDF) file.","Once the file has been interpreted by the file interpretation module , the feed web server  can transmit the listing data to the listing manager  for processing, categorization, sanitation of data, data format check, regular expression check, etc. In addition, a fraud pre-filtration process can be performed in order to verify that the data provided is current, relevant, and non-fraudulent. Categories for fraud filtration of data may include offensive listings, illegal listings, irrelevant listings, etc. Techniques utilized in automatic categorization of listing data, including job listings, are described in detail in the U.S. patent application Ser. No 10\/920,588, filed August, 2004, and entitled Automatic Product Categorization, assigned to the assigned of this disclosure.","Upon processing the listing data, the listing manager  can further relay the listing data to the listing server  for posting the listings on a website on the Internet . Thereafter, a user searching for listed items of interest (e.g., a job seeker, a homebuyer, etc) can access, through the user computing device , the listing data via the listing service provider .",{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0045","num":"0044"},"figref":"FIG. 3A","b":["300","300","201","210","201","300","300","201","302","304","304","306","308","310"]},{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0046","num":"0045"},"figref":"FIG. 3B","b":["312","201","312","314"]},"In one embodiment, a lister may be a frequent user. The lister can be provided with a preconfigured or user defined a username for identification. The lister can upload a file under the username. The feed web server  can parse the uploaded file and further associate the listings in the file to the lister. The lister can then be provided with the ability to administrate the submitted data listings. In another embodiment, a lister as a first-time user, is not required to have a username to upload a listing data file.","The file that is uploaded by the lister can be formatted in a standard format, which is also known to the file interpretation module . The file interpretation module  can include rules and definitions for an IRD file. In one example, the information resource definition can be established as shown in Table A.

As such, the lister can program existing applications or develop a new application that can retrieve listing data from a local listing database , and transmit such listing data to the web service server . For example, a lister can develop the computer application  to periodically retrieve listing data from the listing database  and transmit the data to the web service server . In another example, the lister can simply incorporate the APIs provided by the listing service provider  into existing applications, and make calls to the provided APIs in order to submit the data to the listing service provider . In yet another example, the lister can develop an application for data entry and submission to the web service server .","In another embodiment, the application development kit provides APIs that encode data in an IRD format for transmission to the web service server . As such, the web service server  can include, or be interfaced with, a file interpretation module  as illustrated in . The lister application  can be implemented to package listing data in IRD format for transmission to the web service server . The implementation of the lister application  can include API calls for encoding the data to IRD format and for transmitting the listing data directly to the file interpretation module .","The file interpretation module  can reside at the web service server , or any other server shared by other processes in the computer configuration of the listing service provider . After the web service module  parses and interprets the listing data received, the web service module  transmits the data to the listing manger  for further processing, categorization, etc. Here again, the listing data is then published on a web site by the listing server  and then later viewed at a user computing device .","Pull Methodology","A data acquisition system can be used by a listing service provider in order to enhance the data acquisition model such that the data is gathered from specific Internet locations. In other words, listers can provide the location of the data to the listing service provider, which, in turn, collects or \u201cpulls\u201d the data from the network location provided by the lister. Once the listing service provider is provided with information regarding the location of the listing data, the listing service provider can initiate a directed web crawler to collect the data at the specific network location provided by the lister.","A directed web crawler can be a web crawler having a predetermined location on the Internet. Unlike traditional web crawlers, which crawl travel around the Internet without a specific destination a directed web crawler can collect the information from a specific location with the assurance that useful and meaningful data can be found at each visited web site.",{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0058","num":"0057"},"figref":"FIG. 5","b":["500","501","501","502","108","510","502","506","501","514","512","506","506","506","512"]},"Furthermore, the location feeding module  can permit a lister to provide additional information to the location receipt module . For instance, the location feeding module  can permit the lister to schedule data collection times. In another example, the lister can set the frequency of data collections. Furthermore, the location feeding module  can be configured such that higher data collection frequency would entail a charge to the lister on a per-listing basis. Once the location of the listing data is received at the location receipt module , the web crawler module  can be activated to web crawl and collect the data from the indicated location. The crawling process can be activated periodically (e.g. every fifteen minutes), or with a frequency indicated by the user.","In addition, the lister's computer  can include a listings database  that stores the listing data that the lister wishes to post to the Internet. In one embodiment, the listing database  is a single file. In another embodiment, the listing database  is a collection of files. The listings database  can be partially accessible via the network location supplied to the location receipt module . Alternatively, the listings database  can be fully accessible. Furthermore, the location of the listings database  can be in one or distributed across multiple sites or locations.","The listings database  may comprise a text file, which can be collected by the web crawler module . The text file can include the listing data in a data format that is recognized by the file interpretation module . In addition, the text file can include listing data in a data format that is specific to the listing data collection server  such that only the file interpretation module  can fully interpret the data. As such, the file presented can be in an Excel, HR-XML, RDF, or other format. In addition, the file presented can also be in IRD format, as discussed above.","Once the file is collected, the file interpretation module  interprets the data based on the IRD definitions, and provides the data to the listing manager .

Thus, for example, at the top level of the site of the lister, a pre-established name that indicates the presence of a resource URL can be used (e.g. resource.xml).
