title: Meter data management systems, methods, and software with outage management capabilities
abstract: The present inventors recognized a need to leverage the data from Advanced Metering Systems (AMIs) in the management of electrical outages. To address this and/or other needs, they present inventors devised, among other things, systems, methods, and software that not only intelligently filter and communicate AMI outage data to Outage Management Systems (OMSs), but also facilitate communications between OMSs and multiple types of AMI systems. One exemplary system includes an outage management module that receives AMI outage data in the form of “last gasp” messages from meters and determines whether the OMS is already aware of a power outage associated with those meters. If the OMS is already aware of an outage associated with these meters, the outage management module excludes the outage reports from its communications with the OMS, thereby preserving its capacity to handle new outage information and overcoming a significant obstacle to using AMI data within OMSs.

The copyright owner has no objection to the facsimile reproduction by anyone of the patent document or the patent disclosure, as it appears in the Patent and Trademark Office patent files or records, but otherwise reserves all copyrights whatsoever. The following notice applies to this document: Copyright\u00a9 2009-2010, Ecologic Analytics, LLC.","Various embodiments of the present invention concern advanced metering systems (AMSs), meter data management systems (MDMSs) and outage management systems (OMSs) for electric utility companies.","Electric utility companies regularly collect usage data from meters. Over the last few decades, many public utilities have modernized their data collection using automated meter reading (AMR) to reduce the time and expense of collecting this data manually. More recently, technology has evolved to more advanced metering systems, generally referred to as Advanced Meter Infrastructure (AMI) that allows reliable two-way communications with meters and utilities have responded to the dynamic pricing of electricity by shifting from once-a-month meter readings to daily, hourly or even sub-hourly meter readings.","To facilitate the management of the fantastic amounts of data generated from increased read frequency, many utilities are now using meter data management systems (MDMSs), which not only manage and organize the incoming AMI data into a database, but also validate it, fill in missing data, and generally ensure that utilities have sufficiently accurate data to bill their customers. One of the leading providers of MDMSs is Ecologic Analytics of Bloomington, Minn., the employer of the present inventors.","One problem recognized by the present inventors concerns AMI systems and outage management systems (OMSs). An OMS is a computer system used by utility operators to manage the restoration of electrical service in the event of a power outage. These systems typically receive telephone outage reports from customers through a call center and\/or Interactive Voice Response (IVR) system, and plot them on a digital map or model of the electrical distribution network. The OMS also includes a rules engine that uses reported outage locations and the network model to determine the source and scope of the outage, and thus provide valuable information for restoring electric power to outage areas.","Although it has been known for some time that AMI systems held the potential to provide outage reports, in the form of \u201clast gasp\u201d messages from meters that had lost power, little if anything at all, has been achieved in actually taking advantage of this possibility. One problem is that AMI systems can generate orders of magnitude more call-equivalent \u201clast gasp\u201d and restore messages in any given time span time than customers can, and OMSs simply lack the capacity to handle this level of input.","Consider for example that AMI meters can report outages at any time of day or night, whereas customers may have long periods of time, such as while away at work or while sleeping, when they are unaware of power outages and thus unlikely to report them. Moreover, even when they are aware, many customers rely on their neighbors to report outages or they simply assume that the utility will already know. In contrast, all the AMI meters affected by an outage would attempt to automatically report the outage almost simultaneously regardless of time of day. Thus, larger outages affecting thousands and or even millions of customers would easily overwhelm a conventional OMS.","Another issue is that larger utilities often have a diverse set of AMI meters and Head End systems from different manufacturers, with those from one manufacturer communicating using proprietary protocols that are distinct from and incompatible with those of another. Conventional OMSs, which rely on phoned-in reports, not only lack a way of communicating with AMIs, but also have no mechanism for optimizing interactions with multiple types of AMI technologies.","Accordingly, the present inventors have recognized a need for bridging the gap between the rich data available in AMIs and the ability of OMSs to actually use it.","To address this and\/or other needs, the present inventors devised, among other things, meter data management systems, methods, and software that not only intelligently filter and communicate AMI outage data to OMSs, but also facilitate communications between OMSs and multiple types of AMI systems. One exemplary MDMS includes an outage management module that receives AMI outage data in the form of \u201clast gasp\u201d messages from meters and determines whether the OMS is already aware of a power outage associated with those meters. If the OMS is already aware of an outage associated with these meters, the outage management module excludes the outage reports from its communications with the OMS, thereby preserving the OMS's capacity to handle new outage information.","Additionally, the outage management module in the exemplary system helps verify restoration of power by intelligently communicating with meters in an AMR system. For example, the exemplary system automatically collects meter data from meters that have been re-energized and instead of contacting these meters in response to requests to verify restoration, the system can generate a verification report based on the data it already has, thereby not only rapidly responding to verification requests, but also reducing communication traffic between the MDMS and the AMR system.","This document, which incorporates the drawings and the appended claims, describes one or more specific embodiments of an invention.

Direct updates include outage status notifications and responses to ping (power status) requests. Indirect updates include meter read data, which can be used as proxy for the energized status of the meter at the observation time of the meter reading. In some embodiments, OMM  can optionally accept outage status notifications from other external systems like a CIS or IVR system. When available, using the information from the AMI head-end system(s) and other external systems, OMM  tracks what it deems to be the current energization status of each end point.","Also, OMM  accepts outage status notification messages from OMS  for end points as well as distribution transformers. OMM  uses these outage status notifications to track what OMS  currently believes the energization status to be for each end point. Whenever OMS  sends OMM  the energization status of a distribution transformer, OMM infers the same energization status to the end point(s) associated with that distribution transformer. In addition, OMM  can perform periodic proactive power status checks (referred to as restoration scout function) to identify end points that have transitioned to the energized state without that transition having been reported to OMM  by the aforementioned direct and indirect update mechanisms. Typically, the restoration scout function is enabled for metering systems that are not able to deliver restoration messages to OMM  for a sufficiently high percentage of re-energized end points; however the restoration scout function may be used with any metering system technology.","OMM  generally uses all of the energization state and energization state transition data at its disposal to best identify and scope outages and to verify outage restorations according to the particular business rules of each utility. OMM  is a highly configurable system that can operate with or without a separate OMS. It can be proactive or reactive in scoping activities and in detecting and verifying restorations.","More particularly, OMM  includes a configuration module  and outage management data structures .","Configuration module  stores OMM configuration parameters and machine readable and\/or executable instructions for providing a configuration GUI to an access device, such as access device . The OMM configuration parameters support and define the specific functional and business flow requirements of each utility. A listing of the OMM configuration parameters, along with default or recommended settings to achieve behaviors associated with an exemplary OMM installation is included as Appendix A. Notably, one or more of the configuration parameters are representative or indicative of rules and\/or thresholds within OMS . For example, one or more of the configuration parameters are based on threshold number of end point outages that the OMS uses to infer outage of the associated distribution transformer. OMM uses this type of configuration data to minimize the amount of end point status information that it communicates to the OMS to indicate a transformer outage. (Conventional, OMS is typically not designed to receive transformer outage information from customers.)","Many of the configuration parameters used to drive the OMM processing can be specified as a function of outage region, outage mode and metering system. Outage modes are set individually by outage region and are normally determined automatically as a function of time of day (time-based outage mode) and the percentage of de-energized service points in a given Outage Region (storm-based or threshold-based outage mode). Outage modes can also be switched manually by an authorized user using a graphical user interface, such as Ecologic Analytics\u2122 Navigator\u2122 interface. In addition to configuration parameters, there are Assumptions and Conventions associated with the behavior of the OMM. A listing of these is included in Appendix B.","OM data structures  include data structures, such as tables and relational databases, containing the data used by OMM to function. Data structure , which is generally representative of the data structures in the exemplary embodiment includes a meter or end point identification (ID) A which is logically associated with one or more data fields, such as data fields B-H. Data field B provides a technology indicator to indicate the AMI technology type of the end point. For example, the technology indicator can indicate a system from one of the following manufacturers DCSI, Hexagram, Cellnet, Silver Spring Networks (SSN), and Landis+Gyr.","Data field C provides a geographic region indicator for a geographic region to which the corresponding end point is assigned. Data field D provides an indication of the outage mode that is currently in effect for the region. Data field E provides a distribution transformer (XFRMR) identifier which identifies a distribution transformer that feeds power to the corresponding end point. Data field F provides an identifier for a source-side protective device, such as fuse or breaker that is coupled to the end point.","Data field G provides energization status indicator indicative of the energization status currently held by OMS  for the corresponding end point, for example energized or de-energized. Data field H provides energization status indicator indicative of the energization status currently held by OMM  for the corresponding end point, for example energized, confirmed, energized inferred, de-energized confirmed, de-energized inferred, or indeterminate. Data fields G and H include time stamp information. Data field H provides event information for the corresponding end point, indicating a historical record of each state change of the end point, and when it occurred.","OMS  can take a variety of computerized forms, which rely on one or more processors and memory. In the exemplary embodiment, OMS  includes OMS data , a rules engine , and a network model .","External systems  include one or more utility management related systems which may provide or require information related to outage management. In the exemplary embodiments, these systems include customer information systems, planned outage systems, and service order processing systems, one or more of which can provide information to OMM  regarding anticipated outage events.

In the exemplary embodiment, the AMI-enabled status is informational only and cannot be changed.","Selection of system-wide defaults tab  results in display of interface screen , as shown in . Interface screen  allows users to view and change system-wide defaults for all OMM parameters. OMM is initially configured with default values for all parameters for these system-wide settings.

Exemplary execution continues at block .","Block  entails determining whether the outage data is known or unknown by the OMM based on the AMI status data it holds. In the exemplary embodiment, when the MDMS receives a last gasp message from an end point (meter), it sends an outage status notification message to OMM with an energization status of \u201cde-energized, confirmed\u201d. When OMM receives this message, it initially determines, for example, by checking a service or endpoint status table, whether that end Point was already in a \u201cde-energized, confirmed\u201d or \u201cde-energized, inferred\u201d state. If it was, OMM log the time of this latest notification, but takes no further action to process the message or pass it to the OMS, instead branching back to block  to process other received data. However, if the outage of this meter is unknown, execution proceeds to block .","In block , OMM waits a configurable amount of time for a restoration message for the same End Point. The duration of the wait period is determined by the configuration parameters defined at block . In some embodiments, the wait period is a function of the geographic region associated with the end point and the outage mode in effect for that region. Outage mode can be function of the time of day or size of the outage. The wait time allows OMM to disregard momentary outages and prevent them from affecting distribution transformer energization status inferencing and\/or from being sent to the OMS. After the wait period, execution continues at block .","Block  entails checking if a restoration message for the end point has been received. If the restoration message has been received, indicating that the outage condition no longer exists and the end point is operational, execution branches back to block  to process other messages. However, if no restoration message for the end point has been received, execution proceeds to block .","Block  determines whether the end point outage represented by the outage message is associated with a larger outage, such as a distribution transformer outage. In the exemplary embodiment, this transformer outage determination is performed using two different methods. The first method entails determining whether a threshold minimum number of end points or threshold percentage of end points (or both) associated with the transformer. (The threshold minimum and threshold percentage are configuration parameters defined in block .) If the threshold minimum number or percentage is satisfied, the outage management module will designate the distribution transformer associated with the end point as exhibiting an outage, or more specifically as \u201cde-energized, inferred.\u201d The second method is based upon identification of simultaneous outage events on multiple distribution transformers having a common nearest source side protective device. If a configurable number of last gasp messages are received in a configurable time frame across multiple distribution transformers having a common nearest source side protective device, OMM will also cause the energization state of these multiple distribution transformers to be set to de-energized, inferred.","If either of the two methods indicates that its condition for inferring the outage to the distribution Transformer level is satisfied, OMM will infer the de-energized state of the given transformer end point to other end points on the affected transformer(s) as indicated at block . Inferring the outage to the other end points entails updating the status of the end points in a state table (OM data ) to indicate de-energized confirmed along with a date stamp for the change. If inferring outage of the transformer is not possible, execution branches to block .","In block , the system, if configured at block  to do so, initiates first level scoping, which involves affirmatively determining whether the other end points associated with the distribution transformer for the de-energized end point are energized or not. To this end, the exemplary embodiment performs a power status check of each of the end points, specifically requesting the metering system(s) to ping all of the AMI-enabled end points on the respective distribution transformer.","In the exemplary embodiment, the power status checking, known as First Level Scoping can be controlled via a configuration parameter that is a function of Outage Region, Outage Mode and Metering System. This allows the utility to optimize the use of AMI network bandwidth under a wide range of operational scenarios ranging from normal operations to large-scale storms.","After receiving the results of the pings, execution continues at block .","In block , OMM again attempts to determine whether the there is a transformer-level outage using the first inference method used at block . Specifically, the OMM determines whether a threshold minimum number of end points or threshold percentage of end points associated with the transformer associated with the end point are also experiencing an outage. If the threshold minimum number or percentage is satisfied, execution branches to block .","In block , the OMM infers that all the end points associated with the distribution transformer for the end point message under consideration are exhibiting an outage. In the exemplary embodiment, this inferring entails labeling or updating OMM status in OM data  for the relevant end points as \u201cde-energized, inferred.\u201d Execution continues at block .","Block  entails determining whether any of the inferred or determined end point outages is associated with an anticipated outage condition. This entails queuing the messages and then checking them against a listing of OMS Anticipated Outage Events. OMM may expect end points to have anticipated outage events based on information received from external systems such as a Customer Information System (for locks and shut offs for non-pay), a Planned Outage System or a Service Order System. There are interfaces to the OMM system to create and delete these Anticipated Outage Events. (Note: If desired, the filtering of Anticipated Outages can be disabled via a configuration parameter.)","At block , OMM  receives outage report data from OMS and updates the OMS status fields for the effected end points in OM data . Execution continues at block .","Block  entails notifying OMS of the outage using a minimum number of energization status messages. In the exemplary embodiment, this entails blocking any outage status messages that were deemed to be associated with an Anticipated Outage or that have are already indicated by their OMS status fields within OM data  to be de-energized This blocking is intended to lessen the burden on OMS by eliminating redundant or otherwise unwanted messages. However, if an end point is already part of a known OMS outage, but the outage event time for the new end point outage status notification message is later (by more than a configurable parameter) than the start time of the known OMS outage, then the new outage event time will be retained by OMM for later use in restoration validation processing.","In block , the utility handles the outage using OMS . In the exemplary embodiment, this entails the utility declaring, managing, and restoring the outage using the OMS and other conventional systems. As repairs are made and power is restored, repair crews and customers may phone in transformer and end point restorations.","In block , OMM  receives restoration (power up) messages from AMI systems . As these messages are received, OMM will update the end point energization status with energized confirmed state indicators and record the time of the energization status change in the respective event logs for the end points. Execution continues at block .","In block , OMM  receives restoration messages from OMS . In the exemplary embodiment, OMS send OMM unsolicited outage status notification messages whenever OMS deems that the energization state of an end point has changed. In response, OMM updates the OMS status tables indicating OMS's view of the energization state of the relevant end points. In response to a restoration notification message of this type, if OMM has previously received an Outage Status Notification from AMI indicating that the End Point is De-Energized and the outage event time associated with that notification is later than the outage start time known to OMS (by more than a configurable parameter), then OMM will send a new Outage Status Notification Message to OMS to inform OMS that the End Point may be de-energized. Execution continues at block .","In block , OMM  receives a restoration verification request from OMS . Exemplary execution advances to block .","At block , OMM  responds to the request by initiating a power status check of all the end points in the verification request that do not have an energized confirmed status in the OM data . In other words, if any of the end points in the request are indicated as being de-energized, energized inferred, or indeterminate, the OMM communicates with the corresponding AMI systems within AMI systems , requesting initiation of a power status check of those end points. However, for those end points indicated by the OM data as being energized confirmed, the OMM will not request initiation of the power status check, thereby conserving bandwidth on the communications channels with AMI systems  and between the headend servers within AMI systems  and their associated end points.","In block , OMM  replies to the verification request with the results of any power status checks and\/or the confirmed energized data that was collected prior to the OMM's receipt of the verification request. If the Energization Status of one or more of the End Points could not be determined for any reason, the reply will also contain an error message for each such End Point indicating the specific error that occurred. The OMS can then use the returned information to determine the existence of new or nested outages. In some embodiments, the OMM also includes special logic to help identify the possible existence of Nested Outages.","In some embodiments, the OMM also includes special logic to help identify the possible existence of Nested Outages following a Momentary Outage scenario. Restoration Messages that OMM receives from a Metering System for which there is no known outage in OMS will be recorded, grouped by common Source Side Protective Device, and analyzed. If the number of these messages received within a configurable time period for any group exceeds another configurable parameter, then the corresponding list of restoration events will be sent to OMS using a special message type that indicates a potential Nested Outage.","In block , the utility declares the outage condition over, assuming that the reply to the verification request has indicated complete restoration. In the event of less than complete verification of the restoration, the OMS may request scoping to be performed.","In the exemplary embodiment, there are two additional ways that information concerning restoration events can be made known to OMM: 1) via the receipt of meter readings that serve as an indication that the End Point was energized at the observation time of the meter reading, and 3) via the Restoration Scout. The variety of methods by which OMM can be made aware of restoration events collectively is designed to minimize the probability that restoration events go undetected for significant periods of time. This in turn helps to improve the utility's outage statistics.","OMM also has a configuration parameter to control integration between OMM and VEE processing. If this function is enabled, the outage state and outage event history tracked by OMM is made available to the MDMS VEE function, allowing VEE to estimate zero consumption for known outage periods.","Data Validation","Whenever OMM receives an unsolicited message from a Metering System, OMS, or another external system for an End Point or Distribution Transformer that is not known to OMM, the error will be logged and no further processing of the message will occur.","Whenever OMM receives from AMI, OMS, or another external system, a message containing information associating an End Point to a Distribution Transformer, OMM will attempt to validate the End Point to Distribution Transformer association before further processing the message. If the validation fails, the error will be logged and, in the case of a request\/reply message, an error code indicting the failure will be returned to the calling system.","Listed below, in alphabetical order, are descriptions of the OMM parameters that affect operation of the exemplary OMM. These parameters as noted above can be readily configured using configuration GUI, as described herein, for example in Appendix C.","All OMM parameters are configured initially with system-level default values, except for MODE_WINDOW_START_TIME and STORM_MODE_THRESHOLD, which must be set by the client utility for each outage mode used by that client utility (as described below in a section entitled Setting System-wide Mode Determination Rules) once the client utility has configured the outage modes it will use.","Notes regarding the table: Parameters that can be set only at a system level have an \u201cX\u201d in the \u201cSystem Level Only\u201d column. (Some embodiments may not be so limited.) Parameters that can be customized by \u201coutage region\u201d, \u201coutage mode\u201d, and\/or \u201cmetering system\u201d have a check in those columns. If a parameter can be customized at multiple levels, then it is possible to set values for any or all combinations of those levels. For example, one can set the RESTORATION_SCOUT_ENDPOINT_PERCENTAGE parameter to 25% for a Big Storm Outage Mode in Region 1 for DCSI, to 20% for a Big Storm Outage Mode in Region 1 for SSN, to 20% for a Big Storm Outage Mode in Region 2 for DCSI, and to 15% for a Big Storm Outage Mode in Region 2 for SSN.","In addition to the parameters listed below, it is also possible to set \u201coutage-enabled\u201d to \u201cYes\u201d or \u201cNo\u201d for each metering system, whether AMI-enabled or not. (When a metering system is Outage-enabled, a row is inserted in the METERING_SYSTEMS table; when a metering system is Outage-disabled, the row is deleted. However, a metering system cannot be Outage-disabled if that metering system has dependent service points in the OUTAGE_SERVICE_POINT table.) Furthermore, as noted in the IS_VEE_INTEGRATION_ENABLED parameter description, the WAVE Outage Flag parameter controls whether WAVE uses the \u201cOUT\u201d estimation rule (zero estimation on a full-day outage day).",{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0139","num":"0160"},"tables":{"@attributes":{"id":"TABLE-US-00002","num":"00002"},"table":{"@attributes":{"frame":"none","colsep":"0","rowsep":"0","pgwide":"1"},"tgroup":[{"@attributes":{"align":"left","colsep":"0","rowsep":"0","cols":"1"},"colspec":{"@attributes":{"colname":"1","colwidth":"441pt","align":"center"}},"tbody":{"@attributes":{"valign":"top"},"row":[{"entry":{"@attributes":{"namest":"1","nameend":"1","align":"center","rowsep":"1"}}},{"entry":"OMM Parameter Descriptions Table"}]}},{"@attributes":{"align":"left","colsep":"0","rowsep":"0","cols":"8"},"colspec":[{"@attributes":{"colname":"1","colwidth":"98pt","align":"left"}},{"@attributes":{"colname":"2","colwidth":"119pt","align":"left"}},{"@attributes":{"colname":"3","colwidth":"35pt","align":"center"}},{"@attributes":{"colname":"4","colwidth":"28pt","align":"center"}},{"@attributes":{"colname":"5","colwidth":"35pt","align":"center"}},{"@attributes":{"colname":"6","colwidth":"35pt","align":"center"}},{"@attributes":{"colname":"7","colwidth":"49pt","align":"center"}},{"@attributes":{"colname":"8","colwidth":"42pt","align":"center"}}],"tbody":{"@attributes":{"valign":"top"},"row":[{"entry":[{},{},"System ",{},{},{},{},{}]},{"entry":[{},{},"Level ","Outage","Outage","Metering ","Recommended ","Default "]},{"entry":["PARAMETER_NAME","PARAMETER_DESCRIPTION","Only","Region","Mode","System","Values","Value"]},{"entry":{"@attributes":{"namest":"1","nameend":"8","align":"center","rowsep":"1"}}},{"entry":["ANTICIPATED_OUTAGE_","Block\/don't block outage and","X","\u2014","\u2014","\u2014","Y or N","Y"]},{"entry":["FILTERING","restoration messages from being sent",{},{},{},{},{},{}]},{"entry":[{},"to OMS if an Anticipated Outage exists",{},{},{},{},{},{}]},{"entry":[{},"for the endpoint.
