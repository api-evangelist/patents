title: Method and apparatus for wireless image transmission
abstract: An image, whether compressed or uncompressed, can be transmitted via a fading communication channel to provide at the receiver an image of good perceptual quality despite the impaired channel. Diversity improves wireless transmission by using highly uncorrelated signal paths to combat channel noise. The apparatus and method of the present invention operates in the wavelet domain by using the properties of the original image or its wavelet transform. For an uncompressed image, one computes the two-dimensional wavelet transform of the source image and scalar quantizes the resulting wavelet coefficients. These coefficients are transmitted as a wireless bit stream with diversity to obtain multiple copies of the decomposed image data. At the receiver, the coefficients of the individual decomposed images are combined to form a composite wavelet transform. The final received image is reconstructed from the composite transform. A compressed image is first error protected and then transmitted by wireless using diversity. Multiple bit streams representing the image are decoded with appropriate channel decoding algorithms followed by image decompression up to the point where the wavelet representations of the multiple images are obtained. Before computing the inverse wavelet transform, the individual wavelet representations are combined using rules based on wavelet transform characteristics. After diversity combining, a composite wavelet representation is obtained, and the received image is reconstructed by performing the inverse wavelet transform on this composite representation.

No. 60\/297,707, filed in the United States Patent and Trademark Office on Jun. 12, 2001.","The invention described herein may be manufactured and used by or for the Government for governmental purposes without the payment of any royalty thereon.","This invention relates to transmitting an image via a fading communication channel to provide at the receiver an image of good perceptual quality despite the impaired channel. This invention relates further to transmitting both uncompressed and compressed images under like circumstances.","Techniques have been proposed for transmitting images over wireless channels by compressing images with the discrete cosine transform (DCT) or the wavelet transform. These techniques can be divided into four categories: (1) detecting and correcting errors, (2) coding images to be error-resilient, (3) concealing errors, and (4) hybrid techniques. Category 1 techniques combat the errors introduced during wireless transmission through automatic repeat requests (ARQs) or through error coding. Category 2 techniques make the transmitted data stream less sensitive to wireless channel errors. Thus, when the data arrives at the receiver, it can be recovered from errors in the bit stream. Category 3 techniques attempt to hide errors that degrade the perceptual quality of the image after it has been received. Category 4 techniques combine the techniques of categories 1-3.","Diversity is a communication technique that improves wireless transmission by using highly uncorrelated signal paths to combat channel noise. Diversity techniques include spatial-, frequency-, and time-diversity. In all of these, multiple uncorrelated signals are combined at the receiver to generate the information. Selection diversity is one simple example of diversity combining that takes the signal from the diversity branch with the highest SNR. Other common techniques for diversity combining are equal-gain and maximal-ratio. All of these techniques carry out diversity combining in the data domain; they attempt to obtain the best estimate of the received digital data.","An object of the present invention is to provide wireless image transmission that improves image quality by combating the effects of fading and other channel impairments.","A further object of the present invention is to provide wireless image transmission that combats the effects of fading and other channel impairments by operating in the wavelet domain using the properties of the original image or its wavelet transform.","Still a further object of the present invention is to provide wireless image transmission that makes use of a diversity combining technique.","The diversity combining technique of the present invention operates in the wavelet domain by using the properties of the original image or its wavelet transform. This approach to wireless image transmission combats the effects of fading and other channel impairments by employing a diversity combining method that directly improves image quality.","Briefly stated, the present invention provides that an image, whether compressed or uncompressed, can be transmitted via a fading communication channel to provide at the receiver an image of good perceptual quality despite the impaired channel. Diversity improves wireless transmission by using highly uncorrelated signal paths to combat channel noise. The apparatus and method of the present invention operates in the wavelet domain by using the properties of the original image or its wavelet transform. For an uncompressed image, one computes the two-dimensional wavelet transform of the source image and scalar quantizes the resulting wavelet coefficients. These coefficients are transmitted as a wireless bit stream. Multiple copies of the decomposed image data are obtained at the receiver due to diversity method being employed. Several diversity methods including frequency diversity, space diversity and time diversity are potential candidates for embodiment. Space diversity may be preferred because it conserves channel bandwidth and channel usage. At the receiver, the coefficients of the individual decomposed images are combined to form a composite wavelet transform. The final received image is reconstructed from the composite transform. A compressed image is first error protected and then transmitted over a wireless channel. Multiple diversity bit streams obtained at the receiver representing the image are decoded with appropriate channel decoding algorithms followed by image decompression up to the point where the wavelet representations of the multiple images are obtained. Before computing the inverse wavelet transform, the individual wavelet representations are combined using rules based on wavelet transform characteristics. After diversity combining, a composite wavelet representation is obtained, and the received image is reconstructed by performing the inverse wavelet transform on this composite representation.","According to an embodiment of the invention, the wavelet domain diversity combining method is able to combat wireless channel impairments effectively and yields images of good perceptual quality for both uncompressed and compressed images.","According to a feature of the invention, the diversity method operates in the wavelet domain instead of in the conventional data domain. The properties of the original image and its wavelet transform allow reception of images of superior quality.","The above, and other objects, features and advantages of the present invention will become apparent from the following description read in conjunction with the accompanying drawings, in which like reference numerals designate the same elements.","Uncompressed Image Data","Referring to , the technique of the present invention for uncompressed images requires inputting images , computing the two-dimensional wavelet transform , of the images, and scalar quantizing  the wavelet coefficients that result from the transform. The wavelet coefficients are then organized in terms of low  and high  resolution sub-bands, converted to their binary representation , modulated , and transmitted  as a bit stream over a wireless communications system without any error control. Due to the diversity method being employed, one obtains multiple copies of the wavelet transform of the image data at the receiver where they are demodulated  and where the demodulated binary stream is converted to individual wavelet transform coefficients , divided into low and high resolution coefficient values  and combined using the Wavelet Domain Diversity Combining method , , , , ,  to form the combined wavelet transform . An inverse wavelet transform is computed to reconstruct the image  and the image is received .","The two-dimensional wavelet transform  of an image is implemented with traditional sub-band filtering using one-dimensional low- and high-pass quadrature mirror filters. The transmitted image is first decomposed using the two-dimensional wavelet transform . This decomposition is followed by uniform scalar quantization  of the wavelet coefficients. The coefficients are then ordered into low  and high  sub-bands and converted to a binary stream  with a specified number of bits representing each coefficient. The binary stream is then modulated  and transmitted  over a wireless channel. At the receiver, the binary stream is received on individual diversity channels, demodulated , and converted to coefficient values . The wavelet transform coefficients are divided into two groups : (1) low-resolution coefficients and (2) high resolution coefficients. In general, the low-resolution sub-band coefficients are more important perceptually. Errors in the high-frequency sub-bands are not as important to the overall image quality. Because the characteristics of the sub-bands are different, the diversity-combining rule for the low-resolution sub-band differs from the combination rule for the high-resolution sub-bands (see FIG. ). The following discussion assumes two diversity channels. Obviously more than two diversity channels can be used in a similar manner.","The low-frequency sub-band and high frequency sub-bands have different sensitivities to bursty channel errors. Therefore the application of rules  (see ) for the two types of sub-bands are different. For both subband types there are two combination modes: selection and combining of coefficients. In the selection of coefficients ,  one wavelet transform coefficient is selected from the wavelet transform coefficients of the two received images and placed in the wavelet transform of the composite image. In the combining of coefficients , ,  groups of coefficients from neighborhoods of both decomposed images are examined, and a value is chosen for the composite decomposed image based on measures from both coefficient neighborhoods. Combining is similar to using both image averaging and spatial filtering to remove channel noise.","For the low-resolution sub-band, the coefficients from the two diversity bit streams are compared as they arrive at the receiver . If the received wavelet coefficients have the same value, we assume that the value is correct and select the coefficient from either channel  to place in the combined wavelet transform . If the coefficient values differ , the receiver waits until a neighborhood of coefficients surrounding the coefficient of interest is available from both channels . Small neighborhoods (e.g., 3 by 3 pixels) of an image are generally smooth, and the intensity usually does not vary significantly within a neighborhood. When the two corresponding coefficients at a location are different, the neighborhoods of coefficients around them are grouped into a set . Then the median value of this set of coefficients is chosen  for the combined low-resolution sub-image at the same location. This median-based technique tends to be more robust to large channel errors than averaging the coefficients to obtain a combined value.","An error in the high frequency sub-bands does not affect the quality of the final reconstructed image as much as an error in the low frequency sub-bands. Also, most of the coefficients have values close to zero. Therefore the errors in the detail sub-bands are processed differently when the received wavelet coefficients are not the same. If the received values are the same , we assume that the value is correct and place it in the combined transform . However, if the received values are different , the coefficient with the minimum absolute value is chosen  for placement into the combined wavelet transform . This choice responds to the fact that a coefficient that implies a strong edge where one does not exist will visually degrade the image more than a coefficient that implies no edge where one really exists. Since most of the coefficients in the high-frequency sub-bands are near zero, there is a better chance that the coefficient with the minimum absolute value will be correct. Even if we set the coefficients to zero in the high-frequency sub-bands, the quality of the final image will still be acceptable.","After one obtains the composite wavelet transform coefficients by combining the individual wavelet transform coefficients , one obtains the final image by computing the inverse wavelet transform  of the composite wavelet transform and receiving  the image.","Referring to , the wavelet coefficient combining process according to fusion rules is graphically depicted. A binary stream of wavelet coefficient values enter through diversity channels . For each diversity channel , a wavelet transform of the image  is composed of low resolution and high resolution sub-band coefficients as the result of the aforementioned step of dividing  (see FIG. ). Fusion rules are applied  to the wavelet transforms to produce a combined wavelet transform of the image .","Compressed Image Data","Referring to , the technique of the present invention for compressed images requires inputting a compressed image  and compressing the image data using the SPIHT algorithm  (see A. Said and W. A. Pearlman, \u201cA new, fast, and efficient image codec based on set partitioning in hierarchical trees, \u201cpp. 243-250 (June 1996)). Header information , sorting information , and refinement information  are first applied to the compressed image data before it is protected with interleaving and error control coding . The image data is then placed into a binary stream representation , modulated , and then transmitted over a wireless communications system  using diversity. Multiple bit streams representing the image data arrive at the receiver where they are demodulated . After the bit streams are deinterleaved and decoded  each stream that represents the compressed image is divided into L blocks of Nbits each, where i=1,2, . . . , L . Every block in a channel should have the same number of bits as its corresponding block in the other channel. For example, the fifth block in channel one should have the same number of bits as the fifth block in channel two.","If the received bit streams corresponding to a block are the same , we assume that the bits are correct and select the block from either channel  for the combined transform . If the bit streams are different , the wavelet coefficients of the image are obtained by decompressing the SPIHT bits in the block for each channel . The block-based diversity rule applies a decision measure to each received block to construct or update wavelet transform coefficients. Based on the calculated decision measure one block is selected from the blocks available from the two channels . The bits from the selected block are used to update the composite wavelet transform coefficients of the image . (see  for two different decision measure rules to calculate the weighting function w(l)). The first rule, the counting measure,  (see ) is based on the local smoothness of the low resolution sub-band and the zerotree (or spatial orientation tree) relationships of the detail sub-bands. The second rule,  (see ) the weighted measure, is based on both local and global measures. The local measures are the local differences for the low-resolution sub-band and the zerotree relationships for the detail sub-bands. The global measures are the variance for the low-resolution sub-band and the individual coefficient values for the detail sub-bands. The decision measure depends on wavelet transform characteristics, as described above for uncompressed data. Since the SPIHT algorithm transmits bits in order of magnitude and not necessarily by sub-band, the decision measures w(l) are calculated from both low-resolution and detail sub-bands, (see FIG. ).","Referring to , depicting the wavelet domain diversity combining process at the receiver for compressed image data where wavelet transform coefficients of individual images are reconstructed with blocks of bits, beginning with the first data block from each channel , , , , ,  (see , FIG. ). The decision measure function w(l) is calculated for every block from each channel , . The calculated decision measure functions w(l) are compared  for each channel and the block with the smaller decision measure is used to update the composite wavelet transform coefficients . For all following blocks of the two channels, the wavelet transform coefficients of the image are updated using the current block of that channel to obtain the current wavelet transform coefficients for the image of that channel , . The decision measure w(l) is calculated after receiving every block and updating the wavelet transform coefficients of each channel. The block from the channel that results in a smaller decision measure w(l) is selected . Composite wavelet transform coefficients are updated using the selected block . Once all the transmitted blocks for an image have been fused to obtain the composite image wavelet transform coefficients, the inverse wavelet transform is applied to construct the transmitted image  (see FIG. ).","Having described the preferred embodiments of the invention with reference to the accompanying drawings, it is to be understood that the invention is not limited to those precise embodiments, and that various changes and modifications may be effected therein by one skilled in the art without departing from the scope or spirit of the invention as defined in the appended claims."],"GOVINT":[{},{}],"BRFSUM":[{},{}],"brief-description-of-drawings":[{},{}],"description-of-drawings":{"heading":"BRIEF DESCRIPTION OF THE DRAWINGS","p":[{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0015","num":"0014"},"figref":"FIG. 1"},{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0016","num":"0015"},"figref":"FIG. 2"},{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0017","num":"0016"},"figref":"FIG. 3"},{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0018","num":"0017"},"figref":"FIG. 4"}]},"DETDESC":[{},{}]}
