{"@attributes":{"id":"description"},"BRFSUM":[{},{}],"heading":["TECHNICAL FIELD","BACKGROUND","DETAILED DESCRIPTION OF EXAMPLE EMBODIMENTS"],"p":["The present disclosure relates generally to mobile communications and more particularly to a method, system and mobile device for implementing maintenance in mobile communications systems.","Modern communications systems involving mobile communications devices are very complex. Such systems often involve multiple network types. The networks can span large geographical areas with multiple access points. The devices run numerous applications and are often changing locations.","Maintenance of such systems, and the devices and networks used therein, is correspondingly complex and resource intensive.","Improvements to maintenance methods and apparatuses for the maintenance of mobile communications systems and the networks and devices used therein are desirable.","Like reference numerals are used in the drawings to denote like elements and features.","The present disclosure provides an example embodiment of a maintenance method that includes a maintenance module operating on a mobile communications device  to cause the device  to determine if the mobile communications device  is in a device context as specified by a device context condition set , and if it is determined that the device  is in a device context condition as specified by a device context condition set  then to cause the device  to collect an actual device context parameter set  of device context parameters specified in a desired device context parameter set  of device context parameters.","The present disclosure also provides an example embodiment of a mobile communications device including a handheld casing enclosing a central processing unit, wireless communications capabilities, and a maintenance module providing instructions which, when operating on the central processing unit, cause the device to determine if the mobile communications device is in a device context as specified by a device context condition set, and if it is determined that the device is in a device context condition as specified by a device context condition set then to collect from the device an actual device context parameter set of device context parameters specified in a desired device context parameter set of device context parameters.","The present disclosure as well provides an example embodiment of a mobile communications system including a plurality of the mobile communications devices, and the maintenance module which also, when operating on the central processing unit, further causes the device to communicate with a maintenance server to provide maintenance data based on the collected context parameters, and the maintenance server, wherein the maintenance server is configured to receive the maintenance data from the device and to perform further maintenance activity utilizing the maintenance data.","The present disclosure further provides an example embodiment of a computer program product including a computer readable medium, and stored on the computer readable medium, the maintenance module.","Communication System","Reference is first made to  which shows in block diagram form a communication system  in which example embodiments of the present disclosure can be applied. The communication system  comprises a number of mobile communication devices (mobile devices)  which may be connected to the remainder of system  in any of several different ways. Accordingly, several instances of mobile communication devices  are depicted in  employing different example ways of connecting to system . Mobile communication devices  are connected to a wireless communication network  which may comprise one or more of a Wireless Wide Area Network (WWAN)  and a Wireless Local Area Network (WLAN)  or other suitable network arrangements. In some embodiments, the mobile communication devices  are configured to communicate over both the WWAN  and WLAN , and to roam between these networks. In some embodiments, the wireless network  may comprise multiple WWANs  and WLANs .","The WWAN  may be implemented as any suitable wireless access network technology. By way of example, but not limitation, the WWAN  may be implemented as a wireless network that includes a number of transceiver base stations  (one of which is shown in ) where each of the base stations  provides wireless Radio Frequency (RF) coverage to a corresponding area or cell. The WWAN  is typically operated by a mobile network service provider that provides subscription packages to users of the mobile communication devices . In some embodiments, the WWAN  conforms to one or more of the following wireless network types: Mobitex Radio Network, DataTAC, GSM (Global System for Mobile Communication), GPRS (General Packet Radio System), TDMA (Time Division Multiple Access), CDMA (Code Division Multiple Access), CDPD (Cellular Digital Packet Data), iDEN (integrated Digital Enhanced Network), EvDO (Evolution-Data Optimized) CDMA2000, EDGE (Enhanced Data rates for GSM Evolution), UMTS (Universal Mobile Telecommunication Systems), HSDPA (High-Speed Downlink Packet Access), IEEE 802.16e (also referred to as Worldwide Interoperability for Microwave Access or \u201cWiMAX), or various other networks. Although WWAN  is described as a \u201cWide-Area\u201d network, that term is intended herein also to incorporate wireless Metropolitan Area Networks (WMAN) and other similar technologies for providing coordinated service wirelessly over an area larger than that covered by typical WLANs.","The WWAN  may further comprise a wireless network gateway  which connects the mobile communication devices  to transport facilities , and through the transport facilities  to a wireless connector system . Transport facilities may include one or more private networks or lines, the public internet, a virtual private network, or any other suitable network. The wireless connector system  may be operated, for example, by an organization or enterprise such as a corporation, university, or governmental department, which allows access to a network  such as an internal or enterprise network and its resources, or the wireless connector system  may be operated by a mobile network provider. In some embodiments, the network  may be realised using the internet rather than an internal or enterprise network.","The wireless network gateway  provides an interface between the wireless connector system  and the WWAN , which facilitates communication between the mobile communication devices  and other devices (not shown) connected, directly or indirectly, to the WWAN . Accordingly, communications sent via the mobile communication devices  are transported via the WWAN  and the wireless network gateway  through transport facilities  to the wireless connector system . Communications sent from the wireless connector system  are received by the wireless network gateway  and transported via the WWAN  to the mobile communication devices .","The WLAN  comprises a wireless network which, in some embodiments, conforms to IEEE 802.11x standards (sometimes referred to as Wi-Fi) such as, for example, the IEEE 802.11a, 802.11b and\/or 802.11g standard. Other communication protocols may be used for the WLAN  in other embodiments such as, for example, IEEE 802.11n, IEEE 802.16e (also referred to as Worldwide Interoperability for Microwave Access or \u201cWiMAX\u201d), or IEEE 802.20 (also referred to as Mobile Wireless Broadband Access). The WLAN  includes one or more wireless RF Access Points (AP)  (one of which is shown in ) that collectively provide a WLAN coverage area.","The WLAN  may be a personal network of the user, an enterprise network, or a hotspot offered by an Internet service provider (ISP), a mobile network provider, or a property owner in a public or semi-public area, for example. The access points  are connected to an access point (AP) interface  which may connect to the wireless connector system  directly (for example, if the access point  is part of an enterprise WLAN  in which the wireless connector system  resides), or indirectly via the transport facilities  if the access point  is a personal Wi-Fi network or Wi-Fi hotspot (in which case a mechanism for securely connecting to the wireless connector system , such as a virtual private network (VPN), may be appropriate). The AP interface  provides translation and routing services between the access points  and the wireless connector system  to facilitate communication, directly or indirectly, with the wireless connector system .","The wireless connector system  may be implemented as one or more servers, and is typically located behind a firewall . The wireless connector system  manages communications, including email messages, to and from a set of managed mobile communication devices . The wireless connector system  also provides administrative control and management capabilities over users and mobile communication devices  which may connect to the wireless connector system .","The wireless connector system  allows the mobile communication devices  to access the network  and connected resources and services such as a messaging server  (for example, a Microsoft Exchange\u2122, IBM Lotus Domino\u2122, or Novell GroupWise\u2122 email messaging server) having a global address book , and optionally other servers . The other servers  may comprise a content server for providing content such as Internet content or content from an organization's internal servers to the mobile communication devices  in the wireless network , and an application server for implementing server-based applications.","The global address book  comprises electronic contact records created and maintained by an IT (information technology) administrator of the network . Typically, the global address book is maintained exclusively by the messaging server  and there is no local copy on the mobile device . In addition, the global address book typically comprises contact records for all users of the respective network  (e.g., enterprise). The contact records in the global address book  may be one or more of individual contact records (or user records) or a group address or distribution list which lists multiple individual (users).","The wireless connector system  typically provides a secure exchange of data (e.g., email messages, personal information manager (PIM) data, and IM data) with the mobile communication devices . In some embodiments, communications between the wireless connector system  and the mobile communication devices  are encrypted. In some embodiments, communications are encrypted using a symmetric encryption key implemented using Advanced Encryption Standard (AES) or Triple Data Encryption Standard (Triple DES) encryption. Private encryption keys are generated in a secure, two-way authenticated environment and are used for both encryption and decryption of data.","The wireless network gateway  is adapted to send data packets received from the mobile device  over the WWAN  to the wireless connector system . The wireless connector system  then sends the data packets to the appropriate connection point such as the messaging server , content server  or application servers . Conversely, the wireless connector system  sends data packets received, for example, from the messaging server  or other server  to the wireless network gateway  which then transmit the data packets to the destination mobile device . The AP interfaces  of the WLAN  provide similar sending functions between the mobile device , the wireless connector system  and network connection point such as the messaging server , content server  and application server .","The network  may comprise a private local area network, metropolitan area network, wide area network, the public Internet or combinations thereof and may include virtual networks constructed using any of these, alone, or in combination. Computers  may be connected to the network  directly or indirectly via an intermediate communication network such as the Internet . When computers  connect to the network indirectly, e.g. via the Internet , a VPN or other mechanism for securely connecting to the network  may be appropriate. Computers  may be of any suitable construction and include at least a processor, and a display screen, one or more user input devices, and a memory each connected to the processor as is known in the art. The computers  could be desktop computers, laptop\/notebook\/netbook computers, or combinations thereof, and may have wired or wireless communication subsystems for connecting to the network .","A mobile device  may alternatively connect to the wireless connector system  using a computer  via the network . In at least some embodiments, for security purposes the computers  with which the mobile devices  can connect to the wireless connector system  are limited to computers  which are directly connected to the network . A link  may be provided for exchanging information between the mobile device  and computer  connected to the wireless connector system . The link  may comprise one or both of a physical interface and short-range wireless communication interface. The physical interface may comprise one or combinations of an Ethernet connection, Universal Serial Bus (USB) connection, Firewire\u2122 (also known as an IEEE 1394 interface) connection, or other serial data connection, via respective ports or interfaces of the mobile device  and computer . The short-range wireless communication interface may be a personal area network (PAN) interface. A personal area network is a wireless point-to-point connection meaning no physical cables are required to connect the two end points.","It will be appreciated that the above-described communication system is provided for the purpose of illustration only, and that the above-described communication system comprises one possible communication network configuration of a multitude of possible configurations for use with the mobile communication devices . The teachings of the present disclosure may be employed in connection with any other type of network and associated devices that are effective in implementing or facilitating wireless communication. Suitable variations of the communication system will be understood to a person of skill in the art and are intended to fall within the scope of the present disclosure.","Mobile Communication Device","Reference is now made to  which illustrates a mobile device  in which example embodiments described in the present disclosure can be applied. The mobile device  is a two-way communication device having data and voice communication capabilities, and the capability to communicate with other computer systems, for example, via the Internet. Depending on the functionality provided by the mobile device , in various embodiments the device  may be a multiple-mode communication device configured for both data and voice communication, a smartphone, a mobile telephone or a PDA (personal digital assistant) enabled for wireless communication, or a computer system with a wireless modem.","The mobile device  includes a rigid case (not shown) housing the components of the device . Some internal components of the device  are constructed on a printed circuit board (PCB). The mobile device  includes a controller comprising at least one processor  (such as a microprocessor) which controls the overall operation of the device . The processor  interacts with device subsystems such as a wireless communication subsystem  for exchanging radio frequency signals with the wireless network  to perform communication functions. The processor  interacts with additional device subsystems including a display screen  such as a liquid crystal display (LCD) screen, input devices  such as a keyboard and control buttons, flash memory , random access memory (RAM) , read only memory (ROM) , auxiliary input\/output (I\/O) subsystems , data port  such as serial data port, such as a Universal Serial Bus (USB) data port, speaker , microphone , short-range communication subsystem , and other device subsystems generally designated as . Some of the subsystems shown in  perform communication-related functions, whereas other subsystems may provide \u201cresident\u201d or on-device functions.","The device  may comprise a touchscreen display in some embodiments. The touchscreen display may be constructed using a touch-sensitive input surface connected to an electronic controller and which overlays the display screen . The touch-sensitive overlay and the electronic controller provide a touch-sensitive input device and the processor  interacts with the touch-sensitive overlay via the electronic controller.","The communication subsystem  includes a receiver , a transmitter , and associated components, such as one or more antenna elements  and , local oscillators (LOs) , and a processing module such as a digital signal processor (DSP) . The antenna elements  and  may be embedded or internal to the mobile device  and a single antenna may be shared by both receiver and transmitter, as is known in the art. As will be apparent to those skilled in the field of communication, the particular design of the wireless communication subsystem  depends on the wireless network  in which mobile device  is intended to operate.","The mobile device  may communicate with any one of a plurality of fixed transceiver base stations  of the wireless network  within its geographic coverage area. The mobile device  may send and receive communication signals over the wireless network  after the required network registration or activation procedures have been completed. Signals received by the antenna  through the wireless network  are input to the receiver , which may perform such common receiver functions as signal amplification, frequency down conversion, filtering, channel selection, etc., as well as analog-to-digital (A\/D) conversion. A\/D conversion of a received signal allows more complex communication functions such as demodulation and decoding to be performed in the DSP . In a similar manner, signals to be transmitted are processed, including modulation and encoding, for example, by the DSP . These DSP-processed signals are output to the transmitter  for digital-to-analog (D\/A) conversion, frequency up conversion, filtering, amplification, and transmission to the wireless network  via the antenna . The DSP  not only processes communication signals, but may also provide for receiver and transmitter control. For example, the gains applied to communication signals in the receiver  and the transmitter  may be adaptively controlled through automatic gain control algorithms implemented in the DSP .","The processor  operates under stored program control and executes software modules  stored in memory such as persistent memory, for example, in the flash memory . As illustrated in , the software modules  comprise operating system software , software applications  comprising an email messaging application  (also referred to as an email client ), a personal address book , a calendar application , a phone application , and maintenance module . An example embodiment of a maintenance module  will be discussed in detail later herein.","The software applications  also may include a range of applications, including, for example, a notepad application, Internet browser application, voice communication (i.e. telephony) application, mapping application, or a media player application, or any combination thereof. Each of the software applications  may include layout information defining the placement of particular fields and graphic elements (e.g. text fields, input fields, icons, etc.) in the user interface (i.e. the display screen ) according to the application.","Those skilled in the art will appreciate that the software modules  or parts thereof may be temporarily loaded into volatile memory such as the RAM . The RAM  is used for storing runtime data variables and other types of data or information, as will be apparent to those skilled in the art. Although specific functions are described for various types of memory, this is merely one example, and those skilled in the art will appreciate that a different assignment of functions to types of memory could also be used.","In some embodiments, the auxiliary I\/O subsystems  may comprise an external communication link or interface, for example, an Ethernet connection. The mobile device  may comprise other wireless communication interfaces for communicating with other types of wireless networks, for example, a wireless network such as an orthogonal frequency division multiplexed (OFDM) network or a GPS (Global Positioning System) subsystem comprising a GPS receiver or transceiver for communicating with a GPS satellite network (not shown). The auxiliary I\/O subsystems  may comprise a pointing or navigational input device such as a clickable trackball or scroll wheel or thumbwheel, or a vibrator for providing vibratory notifications in response to various events on the device  such as receipt of an electronic message or incoming phone call, or for other purposes such as haptic feedback (touch feedback).","In some embodiments, the mobile device  also includes a removable memory card or module  (typically comprising flash memory) and a memory card interface . Network access is typically associated with a subscriber or user of the mobile device  via the memory card , which may be a Subscriber Identity Module (SIM) card for use in a GSM network or other type of memory card for use in the relevant wireless network type. The memory card  is inserted in or connected to the memory card interface  of the mobile device  in order to operate in conjunction with the wireless network .","The mobile device  also stores other data  in an erasable persistent memory, which in one example embodiment is the flash memory . In various embodiments, the data  includes service data comprising information required by the mobile device  to establish and maintain communication with the wireless network . The data  may also include user application data such as email messages, address book and contact information, calendar and schedule information, notepad documents, image files, and other commonly stored user information stored on the mobile device  by its user, and other data. The data  stored in the persistent memory (e.g. flash memory ) of the mobile device  may be organized, at least partially, into a number of databases each containing data items of the same data type or associated with the same application. For example, email messages, contact records, and task items may be stored in individual databases within the device memory.","The mobile device  also includes a battery  as a power source, which is typically one or more rechargeable batteries that may be charged, for example, through charging circuitry coupled to a battery interface such as the serial data port . The battery  provides electrical power to at least some of the electrical circuitry in the mobile device , and the battery interface  provides a mechanical and electrical connection for the battery . The battery interface  is coupled to a regulator (not shown) which provides power V+ to the circuitry of the mobile device .","The short-range communication subsystem  is an additional optional component which provides for communication between the mobile device  and different systems or devices, which need not necessarily be similar devices. For example, the subsystem  may include an infrared device and associated circuits and components, or a wireless bus protocol compliant communication mechanism such as a Bluetooth\u00ae communication module to provide for communication with similarly-enabled systems and devices.","A predetermined set of applications that control basic device operations, including data and possibly voice communication applications will normally be installed on the mobile device  during or after manufacture. Additional applications and\/or upgrades to the operating system  or software applications  may also be loaded onto the mobile device  through the wireless network , the auxiliary I\/O subsystem , the serial port , the short-range communication subsystem , or other suitable subsystem . The downloaded programs or code modules may be permanently installed, for example, written into the program memory (i.e. the flash memory ), or written into and executed from the RAM  for execution by the processor  at runtime. Such flexibility in application installation increases the functionality of the mobile device  and may provide enhanced on-device functions, communication-related functions, or both. For example, secure communication applications may enable electronic commerce functions and other such financial transactions to be performed using the mobile device .","The mobile device  may provide two principal modes of communication: a data communication mode and an optional voice communication mode. In the data communication mode, a received data signal such as a text message, an email message, or Web page download will be processed by the communication subsystem  and input to the processor  for further processing. For example, a downloaded Web page may be further processed by a browser application or an email message may be processed by the email messaging application and output to the display . A user of the mobile device  may also compose data items, such as email messages, for example, using the input devices in conjunction with the display screen . These composed items may be transmitted through the communication subsystem  over the wireless network .","In the voice communication mode, the mobile device  provides telephony functions and operates as a typical cellular phone. The overall operation is similar, except that the received signals would be output to the speaker  and signals for transmission would be generated by a transducer such as the microphone . The telephony functions are provided by a combination of software\/firmware (i.e., the voice communication module) and hardware (i.e., the microphone , the speaker  and input devices). Alternative voice or audio I\/O subsystems, such as a voice message recording subsystem, may also be implemented on the mobile device . Although voice or audio signal output is typically accomplished primarily through the speaker , the display screen  may also be used to provide an indication of the identity of a calling party, duration of a voice call, or other voice call related information.","Maintenance Module","Referring to , one embodiment of the maintenance module  of  has a device context condition sub-module , a device context collection sub-module , a device context logging module , a device context analysis engine  and a maintenance communications sub-module .","Context conditions can be based on presence data such as that used to determine availability of a user of the device  to participate in communications, for example if the device is in the user's office and not in use. Such information can be determined at the device , for example, by checking a GPS location of the device  against a known location of the user's office. Usage of the device  can, for example, be determined from device application status information or CPU usage.","The device context condition sub-module  has one or more device context sets . A device context condition set  defines a potential context of the device  using device context conditions . A device condition context condition set  may be as simple as one device context condition , for example, a particular time of day. Alternatively, a device context condition set  may include a plurality of device context conditions , such as location of the device , time of day, and application running on the device.","It is recognized that the maintenance module and its various components as described herein can form a discrete module running on the device , or the functions of the maintenance module can be distributed on the device  as separate modules or integrated within other existing modules as desired. Such discrete or distributed implementations all fall within the embodiments of a maintenance module as described herein.","The device context sub-module  determines if the actual device context meets one or more device context sets . If so, a context collection sub-module  is activated.","The device context collection sub-module  has one or more desired context parameter sets . A desired context parameter set  may be, for example, received signal strength at the receiver . Alternatively, a desired context parameter set  may be more extensive, including a plurality of operating parameters of the device such as states of the operating system  and applications , and readings through input devices  or auxiliary I\/O devices . Each desired context parameter set is associated with one or more device context condition sets .","The device context collection can have a plurality of sub-modules , for example, one for each desired context condition set . The sub-modules  may come into being in the form of a crawler, or bots, spawned by the maintenance module when a context condition set  is met.","The device context collection sub-module  collects actual device context parameters for the associated desired context parameter set  when activated by the device context sub-module  upon determination that the actual device context meets the associated device context condition set .","Device context logging sub-module  stores actual context parameter sets  collected by the device context collection sub-module  in association with the associated device context condition set .","Analysis engine  analyses context parameter sets  sets logged by the context logging sub-module  to determine if the logged context parameters sets  indicate maintenance to the device , a network or other element of the communications system may be required. For example, the analysis engine  may compare separate sets  of logged parameters collected over different instances of a context condition set  to determine a baseline and then to determine if significant changes from the baseline have occurred. This allows for on-device prediction of possible future failure in a system  component, such as the network  or a device . This allows for predictive or preventive maintenance to occur.","Maintenance communications sub-module  is used by the maintenance module to initiate or receive communications  from a remote maintenance system, such as maintenance server  (). Communication between the maintenance server  and the sub-module  can take place through one or more of the communications capabilities of the device , such as the wireless subsystem  over either a WLAN  or WWAN , or the short range wireless communication system , or a physical interface such as described previously with regard to link .","The maintenance module can initiate communications with the maintenance server to transfer context parameter sets  to the maintenance server  for analysis. Such sets  may be transferred as the sets  are collected, or after storage by the context logging sub-module . Such collected parameter sets  form maintenance data.","The maintenance module can initiate communications through the communications sub-module  to transfer results  of the analysis engine . Such results form maintenance data. This allows for shared participation in maintenance analysis between the device  and the maintenance server .","The maintenance module can receive communications from the maintenance server . Such communications may include uploading updates to the maintenance module . Such communications may include uploading context condition sets  and desired context parameter sets .","The maintenance module and maintenance server  can open an interactive maintenance communications channel for communications between the maintenance module and maintenance server . The maintenance module can communicate the type of information described above to the maintenance server , and the maintenance server  can direct maintenance activities for the device  through the maintenance modules, such as providing further desired context parameter sets  to cause collection of additional actual context parameter sets . Settings of the device  may be altered by the maintenance server  through the maintenance module between collection of context parameter sets , if desired.","A communication channel can be opened through one of the communications capabilities of the device . For example, a communications channel may be opened through the WWAN, WLAN, or via a computer  through the link . The multi-channel capability of the device  allows communication between the maintenance server  and the device  through one channel, while collecting context parameters through a device  capability employed in another channel. For example, to test operation of the WLAN or WWAN context of the device , such as signal strength, protocol, access points, a channel could be opened between the maintenance server  and the device  using the link  to receive instructions or other communications from the maintenance server  and provide test results to the maintenance server . Use of the WLAN while testing operation of the WWAN, or vice versa, may require independent implementations of the wireless communication subsystem or aspects thereof.","Multiple devices  can be maintained through the maintenance server . The maintenance server  can aggregate context data from the devices  to determine proper and improper operating contexts for the elements in the communications system. For example, the maintenance server  can learn a set of context parameters for various context conditions from the various devices  during normal operation. The maintenance server  can then test to see that other devices  are experiencing similar context parameters under the same context conditions.","Where presence data is being used the context condition sub-module  can be a presence sub-module possibly operating as a service on the device , or incorporate a presence service operating within the sub-module .","Presence data can also be collected externally, other than by the device, for example, through the enterprise network. For example, presence data can be collected from a PBX through which a user's office telephone is connected. If the PBX indicates that the user is using the landline then it may be deduced that the user is in the user's office.","External presence data can be acquired by the device  directly from a presence data source, possibly through one or more interfaces. Alternatively, presence data can be obtained from the source, possibly through one or more interfaces, by a presence server . The device  can then obtain the presence data from the presence server . Thus, the presence server  is a source of presence data to the device . The presence server  can aggregate presence data from a number of different sources for the device . The presence server  can perform presence data acquisition and aggregation for a plurality of different devices .","The presence server  may generate and make available Presence data Data Format (PIDF) documents or Rich Presence data Data format (RPID) documents containing presence data for a particular user. The availability information may include information regarding the various devices associated with the user and their state of connectivity, the services provided by those devices. Further details regarding presence data models and PIDF and RPID documents may be found in IETF standards, including J. Rosenberg, \u201cA data model for presence\u201d, RFC 4479, July 2006 and H. Schulzrinne, \u201cRPID: Rich Presence Extensions to the Presence data Data Format (PIDF)\u201d, RFC 4480, July 2006.","The presence server  can act on a \u201cpush\u201d or \u201cpull\u201d model, sending presence data to the device  as the presence data is updated or waiting for the device  to poll the presence server  for updated presence data. In a push model, the maintenance module can be triggered to determine whether or not the device is in a given context condition set upon receipt of updated presence data.","As an example embodiment of the operation of a device  within a communication system , the maintenance module has a context condition set with the following conditions: the device is in the user's office and will not be in use and is not likely to be used for a few minutes. The device reviews its available presence data to determine that the landline phone is in use in the user's office, the device has just been used, and the user is scheduled to be in a meeting for an hour. From this presence data it can be surmised that the user has the device in the user's office and will be busy for an hour and unlikely to use the device. The device determines that the device context conditions have been met. The device then collects device context parameters in accordance with the desired device context parameter set, for example, a series of background WLAN interference measurements. The collected parameters can be stored on the device or reported to the maintenance server , or both.","Presence data indicating the user's busy status can be collected for example from the calendar application  which may indicate that the user is scheduled to be in a meeting for an hour.","Newly collected parameters can be compared against past results of the parameter collection, from the device , or other devices  in similar contexts, to determine if there are anomalies in the collected parameters that possibly warrant maintenance. Where there are anomalies, then the device  updates the maintenance server  such that the maintenance server  can notify a system  administrator to perform maintenance. Performing maintenance in this way can include preventive or predictive maintenance. Anomalies detected in this manner can be indicative of a future failure that can be avoided by performing maintenance in advance.","As an example, if the above collection of background WLAN interference measurements indicates similar readings over separate collections and then a reading is collected that when compared against an earlier parameter collection indicates a significant decline from an access point , the maintenance module can notify the maintenance server  which then notifies an administrator such that the administrator can check the access point .","In this way, the maintenance module operating on the device  acts as an autonomous maintenance agent in the system .","An example embodiment of a maintenance method includes a maintenance module operating on a mobile communications device  to cause the device  to determine if the mobile communications device  is in a device context as specified by a device context condition set , and if it is determined that the device  is in a device context condition as specified by a device context condition set  then to cause the device  to collect an actual device context parameter set  of device context parameters specified in a desired device context parameter set  of device context parameters.","The method can also include the maintenance module storing the collected actual device context parameter set  on the device .","The method can also include the maintenance module analysing the actual device context parameter set  to determine if maintenance is required to a mobile communications system  associated with the device .","The method can also include the device context condition set  including conditions based on presence data for the device .","The method can also include obtaining presence data by the device  from sources ,  on the device .","The method can also include obtaining presence data by the device  from a source  of presence data external to the device .","The method can also include the maintenance module maintaining a communications channel  between the external source  of presence data and the device  through one channel , ,  while collecting device context parameters through a device capability , ,  for another communications channel , , .","The method can include the device context condition set  indicating that the device  is likely to remain in the device context while collection of the device context parameter set  occurs.","The method can further include the maintenance module comparing the collected actual device context parameters  to normal device context parameters for the device context to determine if there are anomalies in the device context.","The method can also include the maintenance module determining normal device context parameters by determining if a mobile communications device  is in a device context as specified by a device context condition set , and if so then collecting from the device  an actual device context parameter set  of device context parameters specified in a desired device context parameter set  of device context parameters, and deriving normal device context parameters from the actual device context parameter set  collected as part of determining normal operating device context parameters.","The method can also include transmitting the collected actual context parameter set  to a maintenance server .","The method can further include the maintenance module analysing the actual device context parameter  set to determine if maintenance is required to a mobile communications system  of the device , and notifying a maintenance server .","The method can further include maintaining a communications channel , ,  between the maintenance server  and the device  through one channel, while collecting device context parameters through a device capability , ,  for another communications channel , , .","The method can further include using a session based communication channel , ,  as the maintained communication channel , , .","The maintenance module can collect context parameters from within the device itself, such as one or more operating states. The maintenance module can also collect context parameters from external to the device  using the input devices  and auxiliary I\/O . As an example context parameters such as GPS location can be collected using a GPS (Global Positioning System) subsystem comprising a GPS receiver or transceiver for communicating with a GPS satellite network (not shown). As a further example context parameters can be collected through the wireless communication subsystem , such as received signal strength, or background interference measurements.","Referring to , at  an example embodiment of a maintenance method includes a maintenance module operating on a mobile communications device  to cause the device  to determine if the mobile communications device  is in a device context as specified by a device context condition set , and, at , if it is determined that the device  is in a device context condition as specified by a device context condition set  then to cause the device  to collect an actual device context parameter set  of device context parameters specified in a desired device context parameter set  of device context parameters.","Referring to , the method can also include at  the maintenance module storing the collected actual device context parameter set  on the device .","The method can also include at  the maintenance module analysing the actual device context parameter set  to determine if maintenance is required to a mobile communications system  associated with the device .","The method can also include the device context condition set  including conditions based on presence data for the device .","The method can also include at  the device  obtaining presence data from sources ,  on the device .","The method can also include at  the device  obtaining presence data from a source  of presence data external to the device .","The method can also include the maintenance module maintaining a first communications channel , , ,  between the external source  of presence data and the device  while collecting device context parameters through a device capability , ,  for a second communications channel , , .","The method can include at  or  the device context condition set  indicating that the device  is likely to remain in the device context while collection of the device context parameter set  occurs.","The method can further include at  the maintenance module comparing the collected actual device context parameters  to normal device context parameters for the device context to determine if the device context is normal.","The method can also include the maintenance module determining normal device context parameters by determining if a mobile communications device  is in a device context as specified by a device context condition set , and if so then collecting from the device  an actual device context parameter set  of device context parameters specified in a desired device context parameter set  of device context parameters, and deriving normal device context parameters from the actual device context parameter set  collected as part of determining normal operating device context parameters.","The method can also include transmitting the collected actual context parameter set  to a maintenance server .","The method can further include at  the maintenance module analysing the actual device context parameter  set to determine if maintenance is required to a mobile communications system  of the device , and at  notifying a maintenance server .","The method can further include at  maintaining a first communications channel , ,  between the maintenance server  and the device , while collecting device context parameters through a device capability , ,  for another communications channel , , .","The method can further include at  the maintained communication channel , ,  being a session based communication channel , , .","Service Management Platform","Referring again to , an example service management platform  can be used to provide session based communication channels to collect presence data from sources external to the device , such as PBX\\IP-PBX .","The service management platform  can also provide session based communication channels between the maintenance server  and the device . Alternatively, the functions of the maintenance server  can be performed by a maintenance application running on the session management platform with session based communications between the device  and the maintenance application.","Embodiments of the present application are not limited to any particular operating system, mobile device architecture, server architecture, or computer programming language.","Although reference may be made to \u201ccalls\u201d in the description of example embodiments below, it will be appreciated that the described systems and methods are applicable to session-based communications in general and not limited to voice calls. It will also be appreciated that the systems and methods may not be limited to sessions and may be applicable to messaging-based communications in some embodiments.","The communication system  may include a Private Branch eXchange (although in various embodiments the PBX may be a standard PBX or an IP-PBX, for simplicity the description below uses the term PBX to refer to both)  having a connection with a Public Switched Telephone Network (PSTN)  for routing incoming and outgoing voice calls. The PBX  is connected to the PSTN  via DID trunks or PRI trunks, for example. The PBX  may use ISDN signaling protocols for setting up and tearing down circuit-switched connections through the PSTN  and related signaling and communications. In some embodiments, the PBX  may be connected to one or more conventional analog telephones . The PBX  is also connected to the enterprise network  and, through it, to telephone terminal devices, such as digital telephone sets , softphones operating on computers, etc. Within the enterprise, each individual may have an associated extension number, sometimes referred to as a PNP (private numbering plan), or direct dial phone number. Calls outgoing from the PBX  to the PSTN  or incoming from the PSTN  to the PBX  are typically circuit-switched calls. Within the enterprise, e.g. between the PBX  and terminal devices, voice calls are often packet-switched calls, for example Voice-over-IP (VoIP) calls.","The communications system  may further include a Service Management Platform (SMP)  for performing some aspects of messaging or session control, like call control and advanced call processing features. The SMP  may, in some cases, also perform some media handling. Collectively the SMP  and PBX  may be referred to as an enterprise communications platform, generally designated . It will be appreciated that the enterprise communications platform  and, in particular, the SMP , is implemented on one or more servers having suitable communications interfaces for connecting to and communicating with the PBX  and\/or DID\/PRI trunks. Although the SMP  may be implemented on a stand-alone server, it will be appreciated that it may be implemented into an existing control agent\/server as a logical software component. As will be described below, the SMP  may be implemented as a multi-layer platform.","The enterprise communications platform  implements the switching to connect session legs and may provide the conversion between, for example, a circuit-switched call and a VoIP call, or to connect legs of other media sessions. In some embodiments, in the context of voice calls the enterprise communications platform  provides a number of additional functions including automated attendant, interactive voice response, call forwarding, voice mail, etc. It may also implement certain usage restrictions on enterprise users, such as blocking international calls or 1-900 calls. In many embodiments, Session Initiation Protocol (SIP) may be used to set-up, manage, and terminate media sessions for voice calls. Other protocols may also be employed by the enterprise communications platform , for example, Web Services, Computer Telephony Integration (CTI) protocol, Session Initiation Protocol for Instant Messaging and Presence Leveraging Extensions (SIMPLE), and various custom Application Programming Interfaces (APIs), as will be described in greater detail below.","One of the functions of the enterprise communications platform  is to extend the features of enterprise telephony to the mobile devices . For example, the enterprise communications platform  may allow the mobile device  to perform functions akin to those normally available on a standard office telephone, such as the digital telephone set  or analog telephone set . Example features may include direct extension dialing, enterprise voice mail, conferencing, call transfer, call park, etc.","Reference is now made to , which shows an embodiment of the enterprise communications system  with a Third Party Call Control architecture. In this embodiment, the SMP  is a multi-layer platform that includes a protocol layer , a services layer  and an application layer . The protocol layer  includes a plurality of interface protocols configured for enabling operation of corresponding applications in the application layer . The services layer  includes a plurality of services that can be leveraged by the interface protocols to create richer applications. Finally, the application layer  includes a plurality of applications that are exposed out to the communication devices and that leverage corresponding ones of the services and interface protocols for enabling the applications.","For example, the protocol layer  can include, among other things, a Session Initiation Protocol or SIP , a Web Services protocol , an Application Programming Interface or API 84, a Computer Telephony Integration protocol or CTI , and a Session Initiation Protocol for Instant Messaging and Presence Leveraging Extensions or SIMPLE protocol . It is contemplated that the interface protocols - are plug-ins that can interface directly with corresponding servers, which will be further described below.","For the purposes of this disclosure, SIP  will be utilized, although it is appreciated that the system  can operate using the above disclosed or additional protocols. As known by those of ordinary skill in the art, SIP is the IETF (Internet Engineering Task Force) standard for multimedia session management, and more specifically is an application-layer control protocol for establishing, maintaining, modifying and terminating multimedia sessions between two or more endpoints. As further known by those of ordinary skill in the art, the SIP protocol  includes two interfaces for signaling: SIP-Trunk (hereinafter referred to as \u201cSIP-T\u201d) and SIP-Line (hereinafter referred to as \u201cSIP-L\u201d). Specifically, the SIP-T interface is utilized when the endpoint is a non-specific entity or not registered (i.e., when communicating between two network entities). In contrast, the SIP-L interface is utilized when the endpoint is registered (i.e., when dialing to a specific extension). The specific operation of the system  utilizing SIP  will be described in further detail below.","The SMP  also includes a plurality of enablers, among other things, a VoIP enabler , a Fixed Mobile Convergence or FMC enabler , a conference services enabler , a presence enabler  and an Instant Messaging or IM enabler . Each of the enablers - are used by corresponding services in the services layer  that combine one or more of the enablers. Each of the applications in the application layer  is then combined with one or more of the services to perform the desired application. For example, a phone call service may use the VoIP or PBX enabler, and an emergency response application may use the phone call service, an Instant Messenger service, a video call service, and email service and\/or a conference service. As a further example, a presence service  may use the presence enabler  to acquire presence data and a maintenance application  may use the presence service .","The application layer  may include a presence application  that uses the presence service  which in turn uses the presence enabler , to provide centralized presence data from one or more presence servers . As shown in , each presence server  is associated with a different PBX  or instant messaging (IM) server, for example Microsoft Live Communications Server TM (LCS) IM or Skype (ST) IM, Other presence servers  or sources of presence data could be used by the presence application  and form part of the SMP  as desired.","The presence application  may be accessed by a device  to obtain external presence data. The presence application  may be accessed by the maintenance server  to utilize presence data or provide presence data to a device . The presence application  may aggregate presence data for retrieval by a device . The presence application  may simply make the presence service  available to a device to access one or more presence servers  through the presence enabler . The presence application  acts as a presence server  for the device . The presence application  can act on a \u201cpush\u201d or \u201cpull\u201d model, sending data to the device  as the presence data is updated or waiting for the device  to poll the presence application  for updated presence data.","The application layer  may also include a maintenance application  that acts as the maintenance server  and is accessible for session based communications between the device  and the maintenance server as part of the SMP . The maintenance server  can be available for access by a system administrator, for example, through a computer on network  such as computer .","As seen in , the presence servers  are in communication with the presence services enabler  preferably through the SIP protocol , although it is recognized that other or additional protocols may be utilized.","While the present disclosure is sometimes described in terms of methods, a person of ordinary skill in the art will understand that the present disclosure is also directed to various apparatus including components for performing at least some of the aspects and features of the described methods, be it by way of hardware components, software or any combination of the two, or in any other manner.
