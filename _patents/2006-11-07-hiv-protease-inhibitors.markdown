No. 10\/382,435, filed Mar. 6, 2003, now, U.S. Pat. No. 7,157,489, and claims the benefit of provisional U.S. Patent Application Ser. No. 60\/383,628, filed Mar. 12, 2002 and provisional U.S. Patent Application Ser. No. 60\/433,627, filed Dec. 13, 2002.","This invention was made with government support under research Grant No. GM53386 awarded by the National Institute of Health (NIH). The government has certain rights in the invention.","The present invention relates to compounds useful for inhibiting HIV protease enzymes. More particularly, the present invention relates to HIV protease inhibitors, methods of manufacturing the inhibitors, and their use as therapeutic agents, for example, in treating wild-type HIV and multidrug-resistant strains of HIV.","It is well known that a wide range of diseases are caused by retroviruses. As presently understood, acquired immunodeficiency syndrome (AIDS) is a disease of the immune system caused by the retrovirus HIV (Human Immunodeficiency Virus). According to estimates from the World Health Organization, AIDS affects millions of people and is continuing to spread. In virtually all cases, AIDS results in death of the infected individual.","Retroviruses HIV-1 and HIV-2 have been identified as a cause of AIDS. A retroviral protease, is a proteolytic enzyme that participates in the maturation of new infectious virions in infected cells during the reproductive cycle. In a number of retroviruses, for example, HIV-1 and HIV-2, each have a region in their genome that codes for a \u201cgag-protease.\u201d The \u201cgag-protease\u201d is responsible for the correct proteolytic cleavage of the precursor proteins that are produced from the genome regions coding for the \u201cGroup Specific Antigens\u201d (gag).","The \u201cgag-protease\u201d cleaves the major core protein p24 of HIV-1 and HIV-2 preferentially N-terminally of proline residues, for example, in the divalent residues Phe-Pro, Leu-Pro, or Tyr-Pro. It is a protease having a catalytically active aspartate residue in the active center, i.e., an aspartate protease. During cleavage, the structural proteins of the virus core are liberated. The \u201cgag-protease\u201d itself is a component of a precursor protein encoded by the pol-genome region of HIV-1 and HIV-2, which also contain regions for the \u201creverse transcriptase\u201d and \u201cintegrase\u201d and is thought to be cleaved by autoproteolysis.","Retroviral protease is a critical enzyme in the retroviral replication process. Propagation of a retrovirus, such as HIV, can be impeded by exposing the virus to a retroviral protease inhibitor. As used herein, protease inhibitor refers to compounds that inhibit proteases of viral origin, and that are useful in the prophylaxis or treatment of viral infections caused by retroviruses, such as HIV, in mammals, both human and nonhuman. Protease inhibitors perform at the final stage of viral replication, and prevent HIV from making new copies of itself by interfering with the HIV protease enzyme. As a result, the new copies of HIV are not able to infect new cells.","Retroviral protease inhibition typically involves a transition-state mimetic whereby the retroviral protease is exposed to a compound that binds, typically in a reversible manner, to the enzyme in competition with the gag and gag-pol proteins to inhibit specific processing of structural proteins and the release of retroviral protease itself. In this manner, retroviral replication proteases can be effectively inhibited.","Several classes of compounds for inhibition of proteases, including HIV protease, have been proposed. Such compounds include hydroxyethylamine isosteres, reduced amide isosteres, and nonpeptide isosteres. See, for example, EP 0 346 847; EP 0 342 541; Roberts et al., \u201cRational Design of Peptide-Based Proteinase Inhibitors,\u201d Science, 248, 358 (1990); Erickson et al., \u201cDesign Activity, and 2.8 \u212b Crystal Structure of a C2 Symmetric Inhibitor Complexed to HIV-1 Protease,\u201d Science, 249, 527 (1990); and S. Thaisrivongs, \u201cStructure-Based Design of Non-Peptide HIV Protease Inhibitors,\u201d 35th Annual Buffalo Medicinal Chemistry Meeting, State University of New York at Buffalo, Buffalo, N.Y., May, 1994. Also, see, for example, U.S. Pat. Nos. 6,008,228; 6,100,277; and 6,245,806.","Some antiviral compounds that act as inhibitors of HIV replication are effective agents in the treatment of AIDS and similar diseases, e.g., azidothymidine or AZT. WO 99\/67254 contains a discussion of AIDS and HIV protease inhibitors, and is incorporated herein by reference. However, a typical problem associated with retroviral protease inhibitors, like HIV protease inhibitors, has been the development of strains of the virus resistant to the inhibitor. The present invention provides nonpeptidic compounds that are effective inhibitors of HIV protease, and are useful in the treatment of AIDS or HIV infections, including multidrug-resistant strains of HIV.","The present invention is directed to a novel class of highly potent HIV protease inhibitors. This class of compounds is useful in the treatment of HIV infection. Protease inhibitors of this new class of compounds have been synthesized and tested for efficacy.","Compounds of the present invention have a general structural formula (I):",{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0014","num":"0013"},"chemistry":{"@attributes":{"id":"CHEM-US-00001","num":"00001"},"img":{"@attributes":{"id":"EMI-C00001","he":"18.71mm","wi":"42.84mm","file":"US07897635-20110301-C00001.TIF","alt":"embedded image","img-content":"chem","img-format":"tif"}}}},"These compounds include, but are not limited to, those having the following structural components: (a) compounds containing a lactam at R, including 5-, 6-, and 7-membered lactams; (b) compounds containing an extension of the Rlactam via a fused or spirocyclic ring system, especially systems containing basic amine substituents and hydroxymethyl substituents for increased binding affinity for HIV protease; (c) compounds containing various Rgroups, including isobutyl, lactams, urethanes, furans, pyrans, pyrrolidines, and piperidines, as well as fused or spirocyclic ring systems extending from the above-mentioned moieties at the Rposition; (d) compounds having an Rgroup such as bistetrahydrofuran or a fused cyclopentyl tetrahydrofuran, as well as other bicyclic ring systems disclosed herein.

The present invention includes not only racemic compounds but also the optically active isomers as well. When a compound of structural formula (I) is desired as a single enantiomer, it can be obtained either by resolution of the final product or by stereospecific synthesis from either isomerically pure starting material or use of a chiral auxiliary reagent, for example, see Z. Ma et al., 8(6), pages 883-888 (1997). Resolution of the final product, an intermediate, or a starting material can be achieved by any suitable method known in the art. Additionally, in situations where tautomers of the compounds of structural formula (I) are possible, the present invention is intended to include all tautomeric forms of the compounds. As demonstrated hereafter, specific stereoisomers can exhibit an exceptional ability to inhibit HIV protease, and can be used alone or in combination with other HIV and AIDS therapies.","As used herein, the term pharmaceutically acceptable salts refers compounds of structural formula (I) which contain acidic moieties and form salts with suitable cations. Suitable pharmaceutically acceptable cations include alkali metal (e.g., sodium or potassium) and alkaline earth metal (e.g., calcium or magnesium) cations. The pharmaceutically acceptable salts of the compounds of structural formula (I), which contain a basic center, are acid addition salts formed with pharmaceutically acceptable acids. Examples include the hydrochloride, hydrobromide, sulfate or bisulfate, phosphate or hydrogen phosphate, acetate, benzoate, succinate, fumarate, maleate, lactate, citrate, tartrate, gluconate, methanesulfonate, benzene sulfonate, and p-toluenesulfonate salts. In light of the foregoing, any reference to compounds of the present invention appearing herein is intended to include compounds of structural formula (I), as well as pharmaceutically acceptable salts, prodrugs, and solvates thereof.","The term \u201cprodrug\u201d as used herein refers to compounds that are rapidly transformed in vivo to a compound having structural formula (I), for example, by hydrolysis. Prodrug design is discussed generally in Hardma et al. (Eds.), 9th ed., pp. 11-16 (1996). A thorough discussion is provided in Higuchi et al., , Vol. 14, ASCD Symposium Series, and in Roche (ed.), , American Pharmaceutical Association and Pergamon Press (1987). Typically, administration of a drug is followed by elimination from the body or some biotransformation whereby the biological activity of the drug is reduced or eliminated. Alternatively, a biotransformation process can lead to a metabolic by-product, which is itself more or equally active compared to the drug initially administered. Increased understanding of these biotransformation processes permits the design of so-called \u201cprodrugs,\u201d which, following a biotransformation, become more physiologically active in their altered state. Prodrugs, therefore, encompass compounds that are converted to pharmacologically active metabolites.","To illustrate, prodrugs can be converted into a pharmacologically active form through hydrolysis of, for example, an ester or amide linkage, thereby introducing or exposing a functional group on the resultant product. The prodrugs can be designed to react with an endogenous compound to form a water-soluble conjugate that further enhances the pharmacological properties of the compound, for example, increased circulatory half-life. Alternatively, prodrugs can be designed to undergo covalent modification on a functional group with, for example, glucuronic acid, sulfate, glutathione, an amino acid, or acetate. The resulting conjugate can be inactivated and excreted in the urine, or rendered more potent than the parent compound. High molecular weight conjugates also can be excreted into the bile, subjected to enzymatic cleavage, and released back into the circulation, thereby effectively increasing the biological half-life of the originally administered compound.","The compounds of the present invention can be therapeutically administered as the neat chemical, but it is preferable to administer compounds of structural formula (I) as a pharmaceutical composition or formulation. Accordingly, the present invention further provides for pharmaceutical formulations comprising a compound of structural formula (I), or pharmaceutically acceptable salts thereof, together with one or more pharmaceutically acceptable carriers and, optionally, other therapeutic and\/or prophylactic ingredients. The carriers are \u201cacceptable\u201d in the sense of being compatible with the other ingredients of the formulation and not deleterious to the recipient thereof.","Inhibition of HIV protease typically is measured using a dose-response assay in which a sensitive assay system is contacted with a compound of interest over a range of concentrations at which no or minimal effect is observed, through higher concentrations at which partial effect is observed, to saturating concentrations at which a maximum effect is observed. Assays of the dose-response effect of inhibitor compounds can be described as a curve expressing a degree of inhibition as a function of concentration. The curve theoretically passes through a point at which the concentration is sufficient to reduce activity of the HIV protease enzyme to a level that is 50% that of the difference between minimal and maximal enzyme activity in the assay. This concentration is defined as the Inhibitory Concentration (50%) or IC.","Comparisons of the efficacy of inhibitors often are provided with reference to comparative ICvalues, wherein a higher ICvalue indicates that the test compound is less potent, and a lower ICvalue indicates that the compound is more potent, than a reference compound. Compounds useful for the method of the present invention demonstrate an ICvalue of less than 100 \u03bcM when measured using the dose-response assay. Preferred compounds demonstrate an ICvalue of less than 50 \u03bcM. More preferred compounds demonstrate an ICvalue of less than 5 \u03bcM. Still more preferred compounds for the present invention demonstrate an ICvalue of less than 3 \u03bcM (3000 nM), less than 0.5 \u03bcM (500 nM), and less than 0.1 \u03bcM (100 nM), for example, 5 pM to 0.1 nM.","Compounds and pharmaceutical compositions suitable for use in the present invention include those wherein the active ingredient is administered in an effective amount to achieve its intended purpose. More specifically, a \u201ctherapeutically effective amount\u201d means an amount effective to inhibit development of, or to alleviate the existing symptoms of, the subject being treated. Determination of the effective amount is well within the capability of those skilled in the art, especially in light of the detailed disclosure provided herein.","A \u201ctherapeutically effective dose\u201d refers to that amount of the compound that results in achieving the desired effect. Toxicity and therapeutic efficacy of such compounds can be determined by standard pharmaceutical procedures in cell cultures or experimental animals, e.g., for determining the LD(the dose lethal to 50% of the population) and the ED(the dose therapeutically effective in 50% of the population). The dose ratio between toxic and therapeutic effects is the therapeutic index, which is expressed as the ratio of LDto ED. Compounds that exhibit high therapeutic indices (i.e., a toxic dose that is substantially higher than the effective dose) are preferred. The data obtained can be used in formulating a dosage range for use in humans. The dosage of such compounds preferably lies within a range of circulating concentrations that include the ED50 with little or no toxicity. The dosage can vary within this range depending upon the dosage form employed, and the route of administration utilized.","The term \u201ccontainer\u201d means any receptacle and closure therefore suitable for storing, shipping, dispensing, and\/or handling a pharmaceutical product.","The term \u201cinsert\u201d means information accompanying a product that provides a description of how to administer the product, along with the safety and efficacy data required to allow the physician, pharmacist, and patient to make an informed decision regarding use of the product. The package insert generally is regarded as the \u201clabel\u201d for a pharmaceutical product.","The exact formulation, route of administration, and dosage can be chosen by the individual physician in view of the patient's condition. Dosage amount and interval can be adjusted individually to provide plasma levels of the active moiety which are sufficient to maintain the therapeutic effects.","Pharmaceutical compositions of the invention can be formulated to include a compound of structural formula (I) and one or more additional agents useful in the treatment of HIV and AIDS. For example, compounds of the present invention can be effectively administered at a period of preexposure and\/or postexposure, in combination with a therapeutically effective amount of an AIDS antiviral, immunomodulator, antiinfective, or vaccine, such as those disclosed in U.S. Pat. No. 6,245,806, incorporated herein by reference.","As appreciated by persons skilled in the art, reference herein to treatment extends to prophylaxis, as well as to treatment of established diseases or symptoms. It is further appreciated that the amount of a compound of the invention required for use in treatment varies with the nature of the condition being treated, and with the age and the condition of the patient, and is ultimately determined by the attendant physician or veterinarian.","In general, however, doses employed for adult human treatment typically are in the range of 0.001 mg\/kg to about 100 mg\/kg per day. The desired dose can be administered in a single dose, or as multiple doses administered at appropriate intervals, for example as two, three, four or more sub-doses per day. In practice, the physician determines the actual dosing regimen which is most suitable for an individual patient, and the dosage varies with the age, weight, and response of the particular patient. The above dosages are exemplary of the average case, but there can be individual instances in which higher or lower dosages are merited, and such are within the scope of the present invention.","The terms \u201cadministration of\u201d and \u201cadministering a\u201d compound should be understood to mean providing a compound of the invention or a prodrug of a compound of the invention to an individual in need of treatment.","Thus, in accordance with important features of the present invention, a method of treating, and a pharmaceutical composition for treating, HIV infection and AIDS are provided. The treatment involves administering to a patient in need of such treatment a pharmaceutical composition comprising a pharmaceutical carrier, a therapeutically effective amount of a compound of structural formula (I), and an optional agent useful in the treatment of HIV or AIDS.","Compounds and compositions of the present invention can be administered in a standard manner for the treatment of the indicated diseases, such as orally, parenterally, transmucosally (e.g., sublingually or via buccal administration), topically, transdermally, rectally, via inhalation (e.g., nasal or deep lung inhalation). Parenteral administration includes, but is not limited to intravenous, intraarterial, intraperitoneal, subcutaneous, intramuscular, intrathecal, and intraarticular. Parenteral administration also can be accomplished using a high pressure technique, like POWDERJECT\u2122.","Such preparations also can be formulated as suppositories, e.g., containing conventional suppository bases, such as cocoa butter or other glycerides. Compositions for inhalation typically can be provided in the form of a solution, suspension, or emulsion that can be administered as a dry powder or in the form of an aerosol using a conventional propellant, such as dichlorodifluoromethane or trichlorofluoromethane. Typical topical and transdermal formulations comprise conventional aqueous or nonaqueous vehicles, such as eye drops, creams, ointments, lotions, and pastes, or are in the form of a medicated plaster, patch, or membrane.","Additionally, compositions of the present invention can be formulated for parenteral administration by injection or continuous infusion. Formulations for injection can be in the form of suspensions, solutions, or emulsions in oily or aqueous vehicles, and can contain formulation agents, such as suspending, stabilizing, and\/or dispersing agents. Alternatively, the active ingredient can be in powder form for constitution with a suitable vehicle (e.g., sterile, pyrogen-free water) before use.","A composition of the present invention also can be formulated as a depot preparation. Such long acting formulations can be administered by implantation (for example, subcutaneously or intramuscularly) or by intramuscular injection. Accordingly, the compounds of the invention can be formulated with suitable polymeric or hydrophobic materials (e.g., an emulsion in an acceptable oil), ion exchange resins, or as sparingly soluble derivatives (e.g., a sparingly soluble salt).","For veterinary use, a compound of formula (I), or a nontoxic salt thereof, is administered as a suitably acceptable formulation in accordance with normal veterinary practice. The veterinarian can readily determine the dosing regimen and route of administration that is most appropriate for a particular animal.","As previously stated, the HIV protease inhibitors of the present invention can be administered as the sole active agent, or they can be used in combination with a second active agent which is effective against retroviruses, such as HIV-1. Such second active agents include, but are not limited to, other HIV protease inhibitors, various nucleoside analogs, nonnucleoside reverse transcriptase inhibitors, antivirals, immunomodulators, antiinfectives, tat antagonists, and glycosidase inhibitors. Numerous examples of such second active agents are set forth in U.S. Pat.

Alternatively, the therapeutic agents can be administered to the host at different times, i.e., separately, such that only one or two active agents at a time are present in the host in a therapeutically effective amount.","The compounds of structural formula (I) are effective antiviral compounds and, in particular, are effective retroviral inhibitors. Thus, the subject compounds are effective HIV protease inhibitors. The subject compounds of the present invention also inhibit other retroviruses, such as other lentiviruses, in particular, other strains of HIV, e.g., HIV-2, human T-cell leukemia virus, rous sarcoma virus, simian immunodeficiency virus, feline leukemia virus, feline immunodeficiency virus, and the like. The compounds of structural formula (I), therefore, are effective in the treatment and\/or prophylaxis of retroviral infections.","In addition, the compounds of structural formula (I) are effective in preventing the growth of retroviruses in a solution. Both human and animal cell cultures, such as T-lymphocyte cultures, are utilized for a variety of purposes, such as research and diagnostic procedures including calibrators and controls. Prior to and during the growth and storage of a cell culture, the present inhibitors can be added to a cell culture medium at an effective concentration to prevent the unexpected or undesired replication of a retrovirus that may inadvertently or unknowingly be present in the cell culture. For example, the virus may be present originally in the cell culture because HIV is known to be present in human T-lymphocytes long before it is detectable in blood, or through exposure to the virus. This use of the present inhibitors prevents the unknowing or inadvertent exposure of a potentially lethal retrovirus to a researcher or clinician.","The present invention, therefore, provides a pharmaceutical composition comprising a compound of structural formula (I), together with a pharmaceutically acceptable diluent or carrier therefor.

The data set forth hereafter in the form of ICvalues shows that compounds of the present invention are potent inhibitors of HIV protease.","HIV-1 Protease Inhibition Assay","The HIV-1 protease gene was subcloned into the pET30a vector (Novagen) and then transformed into BL21 (dE3)pLysS cells for protein expression. Protein expression and purification were followed according to Tang's procedure (Hong et al., 1996, 35, 10627-10633). Accumulation of protein has resulted in cellular inclusion bodies. The cell lysates analyzed by SDS-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis showed the expected 11 kDa major band. The inclusion body containing some bacterial proteins was thoroughly washed by using TRITON X-100, solubilized in 8M urea and passed through the Q-sepharose column to remove the bacterial proteins which interfered with subsequent refolding steps. HIV-1 protease was refolded from the urea to an active form by dialysis. As a final step, gel filtration chromatography was used to remove impurities after refolding. Activities of purified HIV-1 protease were examined using a fluorogenic substrate, 2-aminobenzoyl-Thr-Ile-Nle-Phe(pNO2)-Gln-Arg-NH2 (Novabiochem).
