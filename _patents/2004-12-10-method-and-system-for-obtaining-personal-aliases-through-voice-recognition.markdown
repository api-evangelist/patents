{"@attributes":{"id":"description"},"BRFSUM":[{},{}],"heading":["BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION","SUMMARY OF THE INVENTION","DETAILED DESCRIPTION OF ILLUSTRATIVE EMBODIMENTS"],"p":["The present invention generally pertains to systems and methods for automatic pattern recognition. More specifically, the present invention relates to using a speech recognition system to recognize a personal alias.","An alias is a string of letters numbers and\/or symbols that comprise an alternate name of a user or an email address of a user. Aliases are used for interacting with a computer network. User aliases or personal aliases generally contain at least portions of a user's first name, middle name and\/or last name. For example, an alias can be a username portion of an email address.","Aliases were designed to be entered into a computing device using a keyboard. Aliases were never intended to be spoken in the natural language. Thus, if a user has a first name John and a last name Doe, then a possible alias for John Doe could be entered into a computing device as \u201cjdoe\u201d. This example alias includes a portion of the user's first name and the user's full last name without any spaces between the portion of the first name and the full last name.","Automatic speech recognition systems transcribe voice into text using a pronunciation dictionary that spells out textual representations into phonemes. To accommodate out of dictionary vocabulary, such as acronyms and jargon, a letter-to-sound (LTS) subsystem is often included to account for words that are not in the dictionary. However, current LTS subsystems are designed to map orthography into phonemes. For example, if a user were to naturally speak the example alias \u201cjdoe\u201d, a LTS subsystem would spell out the alias as \u201cjay doe\u201d. To force a LTS subsystem to correctly spell out the alias \u201cjdoe\u201d, a user would have to phonetically pronounce the \u201cj\u201d in combination with \u201cdoe\u201d by not pronouncing the \u201cj\u201d as a letter. However, this phonetic pronunciation of an alias is unnatural and confusing.","Automatic speech recognition systems can also transcribe vocally spelled letters into text. However, automatic speech recognition systems have problems understanding individual letters that sound similar. For example, the letters \u201cd\u201d, \u201ce\u201d and \u201cv\u201d all sound similar. Some automatic speech recognition systems employ ways to differentiate between similar sounding letters. For example, the systems require the speaker to say \u201cv as in victor\u201d. However, this is a rather tedious way of entering text.","Embodiments of a present invention pertain to a method of recognizing a spoken alias. The method generates a plurality of alias variations based on a discoverable name and creates phonetic representations for each of the alias variations. The method also includes capturing a phonetic pronunciation of the spoken alias and selecting at least one of the created alias variations that has a phonetic representation that is at least close to the captured phonetic pronunciation. In one embodiment, the discoverable name is the name of a user. In another embodiment, the discoverable name is not a name of a user.","Embodiments of the present invention also pertain to a speech recognition system for recognizing a spoken alias. The system includes an alias variation engine configured to generate a plurality of alias variations based on a discoverable name of a target alias. The discoverable name of the target alias is accessible from a name database. The system also includes a phonetic representation engine configured to create phonetic representations for each of the alias variations. In addition, the system includes a speech recognition engine configured to capture a phonetic pronunciation of the spoken alias and select at least one of the alias variations created by the phonetic representation engine that corresponds to the captured phonetic pronunciation.","The present invention is described in the context of an automated speech recognition system for recognizing spoken aliases. Aliases are defined, herein, as a continuous, uninterrupted string of characters (letters, numbers and\/or symbols) that comprise an alternate name of a user or an email address of a user. Aliases are used for interacting with a computer network or interacting with others who are communicating over a network. Aliases generally or frequently contain at least portions of a first name, middle name last name and\/or organization name. For example, an alias can be a username portion of an email address, a username for instant messaging applications, or the URI (uniform resource identifier) portion of an email address. This is not an exhaustive list of aliases. Other types of aliases are contemplated by the present invention.","Example implementations for such a system includes computing devices such as desktops or mobile devices and computing devices that run automated service programs or automated call centers. Example mobile devices include personal data assistants (PDAs), landline phone and cellular phones.

Text-to-speech engine  has access to dictionary  and LTS subsystem . Text-to-speech engine  first uses dictionary  to locate pronunciations and then resorts to using the LTS subsystem  when the word being processed is not in the dictionary. Those skilled in the art will appreciate that the text-to-speech engine  need not be part of speech recognition system . Rather, text-to-speech engine  may be a part of a separate speech synthesis unit or not included at all. Those skilled in the art will further appreciate that speech recognition engine  and text-to-speech engine  can have their own respective dictionaries and LTS subsystems.","LTS subsystem  is configured to map orthography to phonemes. Generally, aliases are spoken in the natural language. Therefore, LTS sub-system  can not properly recognize a naturally spoken alias. To recognize a spoken alias, speech recognition system  includes an alias variation engine  that is configured to access a system name database  or an external name database  and a set of rules  for defining alias variations. Speech recognition system  also includes a phonetic representation engine  configured to access a set of rules  for defining phonetic representations. The following is a description of a method for recognizing a spoken alias using the components of speech recognition system .",{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0035","num":"0034"},"figref":["FIGS. 4 and 5","FIG. 4"],"b":["400","500","302","302","302","402","302"]},"Referring to , flowchart  illustrates the steps performed for ascertaining the discoverable name of the target alias as indicated in block  of . In one embodiment, the target alias is an alias of a user. For example, the user can speak their own alias for recognition. In another embodiment, the target alias is a personal alias that is not an alias of the user. For example, the user is speaking an alias of a person that the user desires to communicate with. When the target alias is a user's alias, then system  may have an existing relationship with the user. For example, system  can be implemented in a customer call center application with which the user has an existing account. However, it is possible that when the target alias is a user's alias, system  may not have an existing relationship with the user. For example, system  can be implemented in a customer call center application with which the user is enrolling.","At block , speech recognition system  determines whether the identity of the target alias is known. In one embodiment, speech recognition system  knows the identity of the target alias if the system has an existing relationship with the user. Depending on the type of relationship that system  has with the user, the system captures an identifier of the user at block . For example, the user's identifier can be, but is not limited to, the user's discoverable name, employee number, customer number, order number or social security number.","After system  captures the identifier, system  proceeds to block  and retrieves the name of the user or name of the target alias from a system name database . System name database  includes a list of stored discoverable names and corresponding identifiers. The list of discoverable names can include combinations of first names, middle names, last names or organization names. Upon retrieval of a discoverable name from system name database , system  proceeds to block  in .","If, at block , speech recognition system  does not know the identity of the target alias, then the system proceeds to block . At block , system  captures a phonetic pronunciation of a discoverable name of the target alias. The discoverable name of the target alias can be a combination of a first name, middle name, last name or organization name. At block , system  compares the phonetic pronunciation of the name of the target alias to external name database . External name database  is a list of names that exists outside of system . For example, external name database  can be a list of names from a directory assistance provider or a list of names mined from the Internet. Each of the list of names in database  has a corresponding phonetic pronunciation. At block , system  selects a name from external name database  based on the comparison between the captured phonetic pronunciation of the target alias name and the corresponding phonetic pronunciations of the list of names in database . After a name is selected, system  proceeds to block  in .","At block , alias variation engine  generates a plurality of alias variations based on the name that was ascertained from either system name database  or external name database . To generate a plurality of alias variations, alias variation engine  is configured to access the set of rules  for alias variations.","The set of rules  for alias variations are a set of predefined rules. The predefined rules instruct alias variation engine  how to generate different statistical variations of a written alias based on the ascertained name. For example, if the user's name is John Doe, then alias variation engine  can generate a list of alias variations such as jdoe, johndoe, johnd and etc. If the organization's name is Microsoft, then the alias variation engine  can generate a list of alias variations such as microsoft.com, microsoft.net, microsoft.sp.net and etc. The set of rules  for alias iterations can be determined by using a machine learning technique for deducing rules. This machine learning approach can obtain its training data by utilizing databases found in the Internet. For example, the machine learning approach can mine and harvest email addresses from public email servers or mine through the Internet in general to generate ways in which an alias is formed. Examples of techniques for the training process include a Classification and Regression Tree (CART) or artificial neural networks.","At block , phonetic representation engine  creates a phonetic representation for each alias generated by alias variation engine . Phonetic representation engine  is configured to access the set of rules  for phonetic representation of an alias. The set of rules  for phonetic representations are predefined rules. The predefined rules instruct phonetic representation engine  in forming pronunciations for each alias variation of the plurality of alias variations using natural language phonemes.","At block , speech recognition engine  captures a phonetic pronunciation of a spoken alias from a user. At block , speech recognition system  compares the phonetic pronunciation of the spoken alias to each of the phonetic representations of the alias variations. At block , system  selects at least one of the aliases, from the plurality of alias variations, based on the captured phonetic pronunciation.","Those skilled in the art will appreciate that system  may find more than a single alias from the plurality of alias variations that is based on the captured phonetic pronunciation of the spoken alias. However, those skilled in the art will further appreciate that system  may find only a single alias from the plurality of alias variations that is close to the spoken alias. In either case, one embodiment of the present invention includes presenting at least one of the aliases from the plurality of alias variations based on the captured phonetic pronunciation of the spoken alias. By presenting the closest alias variations, the user can pick the proper alias.","In one embodiment, a text-to-speech engine, such as text-to-speech engine  of , is configured to present the alias variations based on the captured phonetic pronunciation of the spoken alias by converting the aliases from text to speech. For example, text-to-speech engine  can present the aliases in a sequentially numbered list or in a list having corresponding identifiers. For example, an identifier can be an alpha-numeric symbol. After system  presents the aliases, the system captures an input signal from the user which corresponds to the alias that the user chooses as the proper alias. The input signal includes, but is not limited to, a speech signal or a signal from an input device that has a corresponding identifier. Examples of an input device include, but are not limited to, a keypad, a touch screen, or a mouse. The use of an input device broadens the usage of system  in cases where speech is not appropriate. For example, speech may not be appropriate in noisy environments and environments where privacy is a concern.","In another embodiment, system  displays a list of alias variations based on the captured phonetic pronunciation of the spoken alias. For example, system  can display the closest alias in a sequentially numbered list or in a list having corresponding alpha-numeric symbols. The user views the aliases and their corresponding symbol. The user chooses the proper alias by speaking the identifier that it corresponds with or by selecting the corresponding identifier with an input device. Examples of an input device include, but are not limited to, a keypad, a touch screen or a mouse. As discussed above, an input device broadens the usage of system  in cases where speech is not appropriate. After the proper alias variation is selected it is stored in system  for later retrieval.","Some embodiments of the present invention include recognizing email addresses. In this embodiment, speech recognition system  can recognize a username portion and an email address URI portion of an email address in accordance with the present invention. In the alternative, the username portion is recognized in accordance with the present invention and the URI portion is determined using techniques commonly used for recognizing Internet domain names for websites.","Although the present invention has been described with reference to particular embodiments, workers skilled in the art will recognize that changes may be made in form and detail without departing from the spirit and scope of the invention."],"brief-description-of-drawings":[{},{}],"description-of-drawings":{"heading":"BRIEF DESCRIPTION OF THE DRAWINGS","p":[{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0009","num":"0008"},"figref":"FIG. 1"},{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0010","num":"0009"},"figref":"FIG. 2"},{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0011","num":"0010"},"figref":"FIG. 3"},{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0012","num":"0011"},"figref":["FIG. 4","FIG. 3"]},{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0013","num":"0012"},"figref":"FIG. 5"}]},"DETDESC":[{},{}]}
