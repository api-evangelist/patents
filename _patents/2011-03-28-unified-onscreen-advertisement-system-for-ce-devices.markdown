title: Unified onscreen advertisement system for CE devices
abstract: A client-server architecture allows consumer electronics (CE) devices to obtain advertisements, including TV and network content recommendations, via a unified application programming interface (API). A gateway server between online advertisement providers and CE devices prioritizes and personalizes the advertisements and recommendations for a requesting CE device. This architecture scales over time and evolves more functionality without requiring CE device software updates.

{"@attributes":{"id":"description"},"RELAPP":[{},{}],"p":["This application claims priority to U.S. provisional patent application Ser. No. 61\/411,601, filed Nov. 9, 2010.","The present application relates generally to unified onscreen advertisement systems for consumer electronics (CE) devices.","With more and more CE devices connecting to the Internet, the opportunities for downstream revenue from advertising embedded within the digital content and on-screen applications are increasing dramatically. Note that \u201cadvertisement\u201d includes sales advertisements for new products and services as well as notifications that items such as purchasable software updates are available.","As understood herein, however, current advertising systems limit the opportunities to increase downstream revenue for the manufacturers of CE devices. This is because advertisers typically contract with Internet advertising agencies to develop advertisements that are provisioned through channels that do not include the manufacturers of the CE devices. While limited revenue may be realized by, e.g., populating advertising campaigns into electronic program guides (EPGs) embedded in some TV models, obstacles remain to expanding advertising revenue to CE device manufacturers beyond the current EPG paradigm. As understood herein a standard network application programming interface (API) for retrieving advertisements for CE devices does not exist, and the use of proprietary APIs will not generate the scale necessary to attract premium advertisers. Additionally, supporting multiple CE platforms complicates negotiation and development with other business entities.","As understood herein, a simple unified advertisement provisioning and delivery service for CE devices may be implemented using a managed server, referred to herein from time to time as a \u201cAd Management\u201d server, which acts as a gateway between the ad providers and the CE devices, prioritizing and personalizing the advertisements and recommendations for the requesting CE device. Advertisement provisioning and retrieval may be accomplished via two ad service application specific interfaces (APIs), referred to below in an example implementation as GetAdList( ) and GetAd( ).","According to principles set forth further below, a simple unified advertisement provisioning and delivery service for CE devices may be implemented using a managed server, referred to herein from time to time as an \u201cAd Management\u201d server, which acts as a gateway between the ad providers and the CE devices, prioritizing and personalizing the advertisements and recommendations for the requesting CE device. Advertisement provisioning may retrieval is accomplished via two ad service application specific interfaces (APIs), referred to below in an example implementation as GetAdList( ) and GetAd( ).","Accordingly, a consumer electronics (CE) device includes a processor and a computer readable storage medium bearing instructions executable by the processor to send a model number of the CE device to a gateway server. The processor receives from the gateway server a list of advertisements which can include actual advertisement content or point the CE device to one or more advertisers to retrieve ads dynamically. The list indicates an order of the advertisements for display, and the order is based on the model number of the CE device. The processor then presents the list on the CE device according to the order.","If desired, the processor can send to the gateway server an identification of a user interface (UI) currently invoked by the processor, and the order may be further based on the identification of the UI. Also, the processor may send to the gateway server an identification of a TV channel currently being displayed by the CE device, and the order can be further based on the identification of the TV channel. Similarly, the processor may send to the gateway server a title of an audio video content currently being displayed by the CE device, with the order being further based on the title of the audio video content.","In example implementations the processor further sends an address of the CE device to the gateway server to obtain the list. If desired, the processor, responsive to a user of the CE device selecting an item from the list, may execute an application programming interface (API) to obtain a full ad corresponding to the selected item. The full ad can be received by the CE device along with client action\/auditing URLs which upload subsequent user actions on the CE device as audit reports to the URLs.","In another aspect, a method includes receiving first and second model information of respective first and second consumer electronics (CE) devices. The first CE device is not the same model as the second CE device. The method includes associating a first list of advertisements (ads) with the first model information, with the first list of ads having a first order among the ads on the first list, and associating a second list of ads with the second model information. The second list of ads has a second order among the ads on the second list. The first and second priorities are different from each other.","In another aspect, a server has a processor and a computer readable storage medium bearing instructions executable by the processor to receive from a consumer electronics (CE) at least a model number of the CE device. Using the model number, the processor arranges advertisements (ads) in an order that is based on the model number and sends the ads in the order to the CE device for presentation thereof by the CE device.","Referring initially to the non-limiting example embodiment shown in , a system  includes a consumer electronics (CE) device  such as a portable TV including a TV tuner  communicating with one or more processors  accessing one or more tangible computer readable storage media  such as disk-based or solid state storage bearing logic and data in accordance with present principles. The CE device  can output audio on one or more speakers . The CE device  can receive streaming video from the Internet using a network interface  such as a wired or wireless modem communicating with the processor  which may execute a software-implemented browser stored on the medium . Video may be presented under control of the processor  on a video display . User commands to the processor  may be received from an input device  such as but hot limited to wired or wireless keyboards, keypads, touch sensor array under the display , mice, or other pointing and clicking device such as a wireless TV remote control, etc. CE devices other than a TV may be used, e.g., smart phones, game consoles, personal digital organizers, notebook computers and other types of computers, etc.","As shown in , the CE device  can communicate through the Internet  or other wide area network with a gateway server  having one or more processors  accessing one or more computer readable storage media  bearing logic and data in accordance with present principles. Other CE devices  likewise can communicate with the gateway server  through the Internet. The various CE devices ,  shown in  may be different models of CE device made by the same manufacturer, so that, for example, the CE device  may be a TV, one of the CE devices  may be a wireless telephone, another may be a personal digital assistant, and so on, each model having its own purpose and processing and display capabilities different from other models.",{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0019","num":"0018"},"figref":"FIG. 1","b":["42","44"]},"Now referring to , which depicts logic used to populate the gateway server  with prioritized ad lists, at block  a list of potential TV channels and content titles may be received. Also, at block  the model numbers of the various CE devices for which it is intended to use prioritized ad provisioning are received along with, for each device, its various user interfaces (UI) it may display. In one example, a manufacturer of a line of CE devices including TVs, cell phones, PDAs, computers, and the like may provide all the available model numbers in the line of CE devices and their corresponding UIs.","Proceeding to block , a list of Internet ads and their addresses at which they may be accessed that the manufacturer of the CE devices whose model numbers were provided at block  is received. Then, at block , in accordance with priority rules developed in concert between the CE device manufacturer and various ad-related entities, the ads received at block  are arranged into multiple associations according to the priority rules based on the CE device type, UI, and in some embodiments content-related information received at block . These lists of associations are stored at the gateway server .","To exemplify, a particular model of CE device, say, model A TV, may be associated with a list of advertisements that are to be presented on the CE device in accordance with further disclosure below in the following order: Ad , then Ad , then Ad , then Ad . If desired, this list may be further refined depending on the particular UIs the CE device has available as indicated at block . For example, when UI # is being displayed on the CE device, the ad list may be truncated to only the top two in the order, whereas when UI # is being displayed on the CE device, all four ads in the list may be displayed. This is but an example, in other embodiments the lists may present different ads altogether depending, e.g., on the different UIs of the different devices, not that one is truncated from the other.","As intimated above, the prioritized list may further vary with content title\/TV channel. For example, when TV channel 2 is being presented in a video window of the display  the order of the above priority (from 1 to 2 to 3 to 4) may change to Ad , Ad , Ad , Ad . The same UI-based modifications may still apply, e.g., when UI # is being displayed on the CE device, the ad list may be truncated to only the top two in the order, whereas when UI # is being displayed on the CE device, all four ads in the list may be displayed.","Next suppose that a particular model of CE device, say, model B PDA, is identified at block . This model B device may be associated with a list of advertisements that are to be presented on the CE device in accordance with further disclosure below in the following order: Ad , then Ad , then Ad , then Ad , with Ad  being the same Ad  as above but with the other Ads being different Ads as indicated by their different numbers. If desired, this list may be further refined depending on the particular UIs the CE device has available as indicated at block . For example, when UI # is being displayed on the CE device, the ad list may be truncated to only the top three in the priority, whereas when UI # is being displayed on the CE device, all four ads in the list may be displayed.","As intimated above, the prioritized list may further vary with content title\/TV channel. For example, when movie title A is being presented in a video window of the display of the PDA the order of the above order may change in accordance with principles above. The same UI-based modifications may still apply, e.g., when UI # is being displayed on the CE device, the ad list may be truncated to only the top three in the order, whereas when UI # is being displayed on the CE device, all four ads in the list may be displayed.","In any case, it may now be appreciated that ads are presented to a first model of CE device using a first order while ads are presented to a second model of CE device using a second order, with the priorities depending on the model of CE device.",{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0027","num":"0026"},"figref":"FIG. 3","b":["54","56","34","58","60"]},"In accordance with the above principles, the gateway server , using the model number of the CE device and if desired the current UI application and currently viewed content information, returns to the CE device a list of prioritized ads based thereon, which is received by the CE device at block  and presented by the CE device on its display, e.g., the display .","Thus, GetAdListO is called from the client CE device and requests the gateway server  to return the current prioritized list of advertisements available for the device. Parameters uploaded by the API may include the device model, MAC address and UI application, allowing the ad list response to be customized for any CE device and UI screen. Furthermore, currently tuned channel, program name, etc., optionally may be included to aid in arranging the ad list returned to the CE device.","The response to the request from the server  may be in extensible markup language (XML) and includes a list of assets describing one or more advertisements. Included in the response may be uniform resource locators (URLs) for static ad content or URLs directing the CE device to the ad servers  for real time dynamic ad content.","Now referring to , the list received by the CE device in  is presented at block  on the display of the CE device. When a user of the device selects an item from the list at block  by, e.g., clicking on the item, an API referred to herein as GetAd( ) is executed at block  to obtain the full ad corresponding to the selected item. The ad is received by the CE device at block  along with, if desired, client action\/auditing URLs which upload the actions as audit reports at block  to the URLs specified in the auditing information downloaded with the ad.","In an example implementation, GetAd( ) thus requests the active advertisement content available for the CE device and is called once for each dynamic ad specified in the ad list. The XML response from the gateway server  may include ad banner URLs, client actions, and impression\/clickthrough auditing URIs. Actions taken by the client software when selecting an ad banner can vary from device to device. For TV devices these may include the following:\n\n","For tracking ad impressions and click-thru, one or more audit URLs per ad banner can be specified.",{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0034","num":"0037"},"figref":"FIG. 5","b":["74","28","12"]},"Returning briefly to , note that the ad content provided to a requesting CE device may come from the proxy server , which obtains the ads from the various ad servers , or directly from the ad servers . The proxy server  may translate standard web ads designed for a browser experience and deliver them to the client device via the same GetAd( ) method described above. Alternatively, the gateway server  may be used for this purpose.","While the particular UNIFIED ONSCREEN ADVERTISEMENT SYSTEM FOR CE DEVICES is herein shown and described in detail, it is to be understood that the subject matter which is encompassed by the present invention is limited only by the claims."],"BRFSUM":[{},{}],"heading":["FIELD OF THE INVENTION","BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION","SUMMARY OF THE INVENTION","DETAILED DESCRIPTION OF THE PREFERRED EMBODIMENT"],"brief-description-of-drawings":[{},{}],"description-of-drawings":{"p":["The details of the present invention, both as to its structure and operation, can best be understood in reference to the accompanying drawings, in which like reference numerals refer to like parts, and in which:",{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0014","num":"0013"},"figref":"FIG. 1"},{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0015","num":"0014"},"figref":"FIGS. 2-4"},{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0016","num":"0015"},"figref":"FIG. 5"}],"heading":"BRIEF DESCRIPTION OF THE DRAWINGS"},"DETDESC":[{},{}]}
