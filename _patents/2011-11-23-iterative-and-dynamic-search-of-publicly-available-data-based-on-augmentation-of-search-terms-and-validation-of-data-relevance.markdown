title: Iterative and dynamic search of publicly available data based on augmentation of search terms and validation of data relevance
abstract: Validation measures related to information obtained from publicly available data sources are generated for providing recommendations about a potential client. Trusted search criteria are used to obtain a set of query results. These results are used to gather metadata associated with a potential client for loan offers. The validation measures are initiated from the associations and used to modify the search criteria or identifying data for searching further. A credit worthiness score related to the potential client is configured based on the validation scores and relevancy of the data. The client information is updated dynamically with continued modification of the initial search criteria in order to alter a scope and improve an accuracy of information.

{"@attributes":{"id":"description"},"BRFSUM":[{},{}],"heading":["TECHNICAL FIELD","BACKGROUND","SUMMARY","DETAILED DESCRIPTION"],"p":["The subject application relates to iterative and dynamic searching of publicly available data based on augmentation of search terms and validation of data relevance.","A number of consumers have experience with short term loans, payday advances, cash advances, and so forth. These types of financial instruments often require proof of employment and financial viability, such as a checking account and evidence of employment. Typically, the interest rate for such instruments can be high, due to the level of risk experienced by the lender. However, when a consumer needs to obtain a quick credit decision, there may be few alternatives except borrowing from pawn shops, friends, or family.","Additionally, consumers are frequently presented with opportunities to apply for instant approval of credit during internet shopping, or at the point of sale during traditional in-store shopping. Often the consumer can charge a current purchase to the new account if they are approved, and may be able to take advantage of one or more promotions for applying. However, consumers having little, or no, credit history are unlikely to be approved for these credit cards, such as with college students trying to start careers for the first time or groups of elderly always wary of credit. In addition, some consumers choose not to use credit cards, or elect not to go through the application process at the time that the offer is presented.","Moreover, retailers often attempt to persuade consumers to purchase additional items, or items related to items that the consumer is purchasing. In order to tailor the suggestions to the desires of the consumer, some retailers employ loyalty cards that enable the retailer to monitor the buying patterns of the consumer. Similarly, online retailers often encourage consumers to maintain a user account with the retailer, and data tracked via the user account can be used to suggest purchase options, or tailor promotions based on the consumer's buying patterns. However, similar to instant credit card applications, some consumers choose not to go through the loyalty card application or online account setup process.","The above-described deficiencies of today's credit application and promotional tools lend for the need to better serve and target potential clients. The above deficiencies are merely intended to provide an overview of some of the problems of conventional systems, and are not intended to be exhaustive. Other problems with conventional systems and corresponding benefits of the various non-limiting embodiments described herein may become further apparent upon review of the following description","The following presents a simplified summary in order to provide a basic understanding of some aspects disclosed herein. This summary is not an extensive overview. It is intended to neither identify key or critical elements nor delineate the scope of the aspects disclosed. Its sole purpose is to present some concepts in a simplified form as a prelude to the more detailed description that is presented later.","Various embodiments for iterative and dynamic searching of publicly available data based on automatic augmentation of search term and validation data are contained herein. An exemplary system comprises a search engine configured to receive identifying data that is related to a client and to generate a first set of search results related to the client from a set of data sources based on the identifying data. A profile analyzer of the system is configured to retrieve the first set of search results, to generate a client profile with metadata associated with the client and to rank the metadata according to a validation measure. An augmentation module is coupled to the search engine that is configured to select at least a portion of the metadata as a set of search data from the client profile. The augmentation module is configured to modify the identifying data with the set of search data as modified identifying data and to initiate a search for a second set of search results related to the client from the set of data sources based on the modified identifying data. The profile analyzer is further configured to update the metadata of the client profile for an updated client profile by a dynamic re-rank of the metadata associated with the client and the validation measure based on the second set of search results.","In another non-limiting embodiment, a method comprises receiving a set of first identifying data that is related to a client at an input component of a search engine. A first search of a set of data sources is received with the set of first identifying data by the search engine resulting in a set of search results. Metadata related to the client is selected from the set of search results to include in a client profile. The client profile is generated with a profile analyzer coupled to the search engine and a validation measure is associated with the metadata. The method includes modifying the set of first identifying data with a set of search data selected from the metadata in the client profile to form a set of second identifying data, executing a second search of the set of data sources using the set of second identifying data to obtain additional search results, and updating at least a part of the metadata of the client profile and the validation measure associated with the metadata based on the additional search results.","In still another non-limiting embodiment, an exemplary computer readable storage medium having computer executable instructions that, in response to execution by a computing system, cause the computing system to perform operations that comprise receiving at a search engine a set of first identifying data related to a client from an input component, executing with the search engine a first search of a set of data sources using the set of first identifying data resulting in a set of search results, selecting metadata included in the set of search results to include in a client profile, generating the client profile having the search results with a profile analyzer and associating a validation measure with the metadata related to the client, augmenting the set of first identifying data with a set of search data from the metadata in the client profile to form a set of second identifying data, executing a second search of data sources using the set of second identifying data to generate additional search results, and updating at least a part of the metadata of the client profile by dynamically re-ranking the metadata with the additional search results and the validation measure that is associated with the metadata.","In yet another non-limiting embodiment, an exemplary system is provided that includes means for searching with a set of identifying data associated with a client and to generate a first set of search results from a set of data sources, means for profiling a client with associated metadata retrieved from the first set of search results and with a rank associated to each metadata according to a validation measure, means for modifying the set of identifying data with the metadata to form a modified set of identifying data to initiate further searching of the modified set of identifying data for a second set of search results, and means for updating the metadata of the client profile by a dynamic re-rank of the metadata associated with the client and the validation measure based on a second set of search results.","Embodiments and examples are described below with reference to the drawings, wherein like reference numerals are used to refer to like elements throughout. In the following description, for purposes of explanation, numerous specific details in the form of examples are set forth in order to provide a thorough understanding of the various embodiments. It will be evident, however, that these specific details are not necessary to the practice of such embodiments. In other instances, well-known structures and devices are shown in block diagram form in order to facilitate description of the various embodiments.","Reference throughout this specification to \u201cone embodiment,\u201d or \u201can embodiment,\u201d means that a particular feature, structure, or characteristic described in connection with the embodiment is included in at least one embodiment. Thus, the appearances of the phrase \u201cin one embodiment,\u201d or \u201cin an embodiment,\u201d in various places throughout this specification are not necessarily all referring to the same embodiment. Furthermore, the particular features, structures, or characteristics may be combined in any suitable manner in one or more embodiments.","As utilized herein, terms \u201ccomponent,\u201d \u201csystem,\u201d \u201cinterface,\u201d and the like are intended to refer to a computer-related entity, hardware, software (e.g., in execution), and\/or firmware.

Data sources are searched with trusted information to obtain search results, in which the client profile is dynamically updated with. Searching is preformed in a recommendation system that builds the client profile and provides advice or recommendation to a user\/vendor based upon the client profile. For example, search iterations are performed by a search engine with terms that are modified or augmented by information in the client profile. Searching at each cycle therefore becomes more focused and reliable with each dynamic modification of the terms and updating of the profile.","Validity measures are assigned to metadata compiled in the client profile. These measures include scores that rank\/rate validity and relevancy of the various metadata. The scores, for example, are determined based on frequency of occurrence within each search, the relationships or associations that the data has with data already compiled and data in each search result, a classification of the data, the data source in which the data originates, the number of relationships, and other weight factors for assessing validity and relevancy of data at each iteration of searching data sources. In return, an advisor component determines an offer to a client based at least in part on the validity scores and relevancy scores of metadata compiled in the client profile.","Referring initially to , illustrated is an example recommendation system  to output one or more recommendations pertaining to potential clients in accordance with various aspects described herein. The system  is operable as a recommendation system, such as to recommend credit to potential clients or to output other recommendations based on analysis of a dynamically and iteratively generated client profile and validation of the data related to the client profile.","For example, the system  includes a profile analyzer  that is operable to output a profile related to a search subject with certain client or identifying data  (e.g., a potential client). For example, a loan can be offered to a potential client based upon dynamically updated and validated data retrieved at a communication link  from data sources(s) . The profile analyzer  is configured to retrieve a first set of search results from data sources , to generate a client profile  with metadata associated with the client and to rank the metadata according to a validation measure. For example, the profile analyzer  obtains data relating to one or more clients , and dynamically generates a profile of candidate characteristics  (profile ) based at least in part on the data obtained. The characteristics are assimilated as metadata associated with the client profile  in storage . In addition, the analyzer  can classify, decide, or otherwise determine an eligibility of the user  for one or more offers based at least in part on the profile .","In one embodiment, the analyzer  receives one or more identification data associated with a client , which is used as search data or key search terms. For example, the identification data can include a client's name, a date of birth, an email address, a geographical region, a home address, a phone number, a gender, a symbol and the like. Other identifying data may also be included, such as a history of transactions with a vendor or user of the recommendation system. For example, where a loan processing recommendation is the desired output from the recommendation system, the identifying data searched may be the history of usage with the financial services of the financial institution or lender.","The analyzer  acquires data, for example, relating to a person that is the potential client  by searching a set of data sources  using the known identifying data about a client , and collecting a set of search results, which are then used to generate and update the client's profile. A processing unit  has an interface communicatively coupled thereto, such as a user interface, GUI or the like and further provides interaction with the profiles . The initial identifying data  may be any data known about the client, such as a name or symbol to such as data retrieved from official data sources  that are private and\/or public sources. For example, identifying data from various credit agencies (e.g., TranUnion, Experion, Equifax), vendor stored databases, or any other official\/private data source that is trusted for reliability is used as the initial identifying data for searching the potential client among public data sources or data sources that are always publically available. Additionally, data that may be initially searched with high reliability may be a client's name, email address, geographical address, transaction history and the like.","The analyzer  is operable therefore as a person analyzer component to start analysis of a person as a potential client for a business loan, for example. The analyzer  connects to the data sources  via a communication link  (e.g., comm link, network connection, etc). For example, the aggregator component  can obtain a set of data relating to the user  by querying one or more internet search engines based on the identifiers provided regarding the client.","The analyzer  inspects information included in the set of search results, and generates the profile  for the user  based at least in part on the information therein. The analyzer  is configured to determine that a set of information in the search results is relevant to the potential client, and includes the set of information in the profile  as metadata. The metadata stored in data storage  is further ranked according to a validation measure and is augmented to the first set of identifying data for further defining search terms in further searches for information pertaining to the client. For example, a name may be used to generate a first set of search results for the set of information stored as metadata. The metadata is weighted or associated with the name to varying degrees so that the weight of each association, for example, may vary depending upon the manner in which the metadata relates to the name. For example, a frequency or a number of times the name is associated with each search result may be ranked together and in addition based upon metadata accumulated in an aggregate data store of the client profile. For example, an alias or nickname for the name being searched may appear a number of times over multiple searches over time, and\/or be a search result that is generated in conjunction with other metadata, and thus, indicate a higher likelihood that the data is correct or valid.","The validation measure includes a validation score that could be in different forms and is not limited to any one weight mechanism. For example, a weighted mechanism can include a binary digit, decimal digit, any other numbering system of a different base, a scale (e.g., from one to ten), graphical weight, and the like. Each weighted association thus provides an indication of a strength of a relationship between data retrieved and data stored and each subsequent search further refines the validation strength of identifying data stored in the client's profile . For example, the profile analyzer  is configured to update the metadata of the client profile by a dynamic re-rank of the metadata and the validation measure based on a second set of search results. The data retrieved, for example, comprises the search results for each search that is dynamically and iteratively generated with modified or augmented identifying data from the profile  compiled from previous searches of data sources. While the validation measure or weight mechanism, for example, varies according to fuzzy logic variables, analog logic, digital logic inputs, rule based values, neural network controls and the like, the resulting weight factor or validity factor is updated and changed with each set of search results for further refining the accuracy of validity and relevancy of the data found as it relates to the client.","In one embodiment, the analyzer  can determine the client's  offer eligibility based on the profile  satisfying a set of predetermined criteria. The predetermined criteria include validity and relevance of the data that has been updated by modified searching or augmented search data. For instance, if the profile  satisfies a predetermined set of loan criteria, then the analyzer  can determine that the user  is eligible for one or more loans. It is to be appreciated that although the profile  is illustrated as being stored in a data store , such implementation is not so limited. For instance, the profile  can be associated with an online shopping portal, stored in a cloud based storage system, or the data storage  can be included in the analyzer  or a data source . In addition, it is to be appreciated that although the analyzer  is illustrated as a stand-alone component, such implementation is not so limited. For instance, the analyzer  can be associated with or included in a software application, an online shopping portal, and so forth.","The data sources  can include virtually any open source or publicly available sources of information, including but not limited to websites, search engine results, social networking websites, online resume databases, job boards, government records, online groups, payment processing services, online subscriptions, and so forth. In addition, the data sources  can include private databases, such as credit reports, loan applications, and so forth.","Referring now to , illustrates an example consumer recommendation system  for providing a recommended loan offer to a potential client in accordance with various aspects described herein. As discussed previously, the analyzer  can acquire data relating to a user , generate a profile  with a computer unit  based at least in part on the data, and further determine an eligibility of the user  for one or more offers based at least in part on the validity and relevance of the data in the profile . The aggregator component  includes an input component , a search component , a profile interpreter , a validation engine module , a modification\/augmentation module  and an interface\/API component, for example. The input component  can obtain, acquire, or otherwise receive one or more identifiers associated with the client as identification data, which is to be searched. For example, the profile analyzer  can execute via a software application wherein the input component  can generate one or more user interfaces enabling a user to input initial identifying data. Additionally or alternatively, the identifiers can be input by a disparate user, such as a customer service representative, an agent, etc., or the identifiers can be dynamically obtained from a source, such as the data storage  or the data sources .","The search engine  retrieves identifying data pertaining to a potential client. The identifying data includes a set of search terms (e.g., keywords, query terms, etc.). In addition, the search component  can identify, ascertain, or otherwise determine a set of data sources  to search based on the search terms or identifiers. For example, the identifiers can include a set of demographic information (e.g., age, location, etc.) for the user , and the search component  can determine to search a set of websites frequented by users having similar demographic information, or a set of search engines having a high probability of locating information relating to users having similar demographic information. In addition, the search component  can perform, direct, or otherwise execute a search on the determined set of data sources , and obtain a set of search results for the client identifying data . Continuing with the previous example, if the search component  determines that information relating to users having similar demographic information can be found via a first and second search engine, then the search component  can query the first and second search engine using the search terms.","The profile interpreter  examines, inspects, or otherwise analyzes the set of search results returned by the search component , and determine a subset of search results that are appropriate for inclusion in the profile  associated with the user . The profile interpreter  can determine that one or more subsets of search results are relevant for inclusion in the profile  based on a correlation with a set of predetermined characteristics, or satisfaction of a set of predetermined criteria. For example, the set of predetermined criterion can include, but are not limited to, a relation of a search result to the user , a trustworthiness of the source from which the search result was obtained, or a classification of the result. For example, if the search engine  returns a social networking website profile for a user having the same name as the user , but the profile information (e.g., data birth, email address, etc.) is different from the identifiers known for the user , then the profile interpreter  can determine that the social networking website profile, or information included in the social networking website profile, should not be included in the profile .","The validation engine module  further examines the profile , and determines validity measure for the identifying data  and metadata stored in the client's profile . The measure can be associated with each metadata indicating a strength of relevance and\/or reliability to the client identifying data . Additionally, the validation measure may correspond to relationships of data in the searched results with metadata in the client profile and\/or with the identifying data. For example, if an email for a potential client is searched as the initial identifying data, the results may include different domain names in conjunction with dates of birth. A domain name associated with a data of birth for the user name of the email as stored in the client profile would have a higher score for reliance and\/or validity than a domain name by itself.","Further, a validation measure can be provided by the validation module  based on a frequency of occurrences (e.g., hits) or search results for the given piece of data retrieved (e.g., first set of search results, second set of searches results, etc.). For example, where a client's email is searched, such as with a user name as the identifying data, a domain name occurrence within the results having a greater frequency than others would indicate strong association with the user name, and thus, be afforded a greater validation measure and ranked greater according to a given scale. The dynamic ranking or measure may be a binary, decimal, scaled on a range, or some weight provided to indicate a relationship or association strength. The validation engine  is further configured to change at least one validation score of the validation scores in response to a change of a strength of at least one association of the associations of the data in the client profile or a change of at least one of the metadata. The updating of scores, for example, is based on a change in a number of the associations among the identifying data, the first set of search results, the second set of search results, and\/or the metadata.","The profile analyzer  also includes a modification\/augmentation module  that provides an iterative and dynamic search process to the search engine . According to the rankings or validity measures provided to the data and various relationships of the metadata stored in the client's profile, the modification module  selects data to modify the identifying data searched as further search data and\/or modifies the initial identifying data to increase accuracy and\/or relevancy for further information and further validation of the metadata associated in the client's profile. The modification module  is configured to select a set of search data from among metadata stored that has one or more validation scores that meet a condition of a predetermined function, for example. Different search results are relevant for inclusion in the profile  based on a correlation with a set of predetermined characteristics, or satisfaction of a condition of a predetermined function. For example, a predetermined function can include, but is not limited to, a relation of a search result to the user , a trustworthiness of the source from which the search result was obtained, or a classification of the result. For example, if the search engine  returns a social networking website profile for a user having the same name as the user , but the profile information (e.g., data birth, email address, etc.) is different from the identifiers known for the user , then the modification engine  can determine that the social networking website profile, or information included in the social networking website profile, should not be included in a new set of search data for the client at a subsequent or second search.","Therefore, an iterative and dynamic search process is performed with each cycle increasing the accuracy, amount, and relevance of the client profile information. Some metadata could be discarded dynamically. For example, where an address has been discovered to have been changed according to a strong validation measure being associated with a new address. Likewise, additional data discovered with modified\/augmented identifying data searched by the engine  may be added to the client's profile. The various rankings are further updated with each new augmented or modified search that indicates a change in relationship of the data and\/or a frequency of occurrences in association with the identifying data of each iterative search.","The interface component  includes any suitable and\/or necessary adapters, connectors, channels, communication paths, etc. to integrate the system  into virtually any operating and\/or database system(s) or a particular set of rules (code) and specifications that software programs can follow to communicate with each other. It also serves as an interface between different software programs and facilitates their interaction, similar to the way the user interface facilitates interaction between humans and computers. Moreover, the interface component  can provide various adapters, connectors, channels, communication paths, etc., that provide for interaction with the system .","While the methods described within this disclosure are illustrated in and described herein as a series of acts or events, it will be appreciated that the illustrated ordering of such acts or events are not to be interpreted in a limiting sense. For example, some acts may occur in different orders and\/or concurrently with other acts or events apart from those illustrated and\/or described herein. In addition, not all illustrated acts may be required to implement one or more aspects or embodiments of the description herein. Further, one or more of the acts depicted herein may be carried out in one or more separate acts and\/or phases.","An example methodology  for implementing a method for a recommendation system is illustrated in . Reference is made to the figures described above for ease of description. However, the method  is not limited to any particular embodiment or example provided within this disclosure.",{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0050","num":"0049"},"figref":"FIG. 3","b":["300","300"]},"At , a set of identifying data (e.g., identifiers, application fields, key words, etc.) can be received and utilized as search terms, user information, signature data, symbols and the like for executing a query for a subject matter or a potential client. For example, the set of identifying data can include a first name, a last name, a date of birth, age, an email address, user name, domain name, geographical residence, telephone number, history and the like. As discussed previously, the identifying data can be received from the user, extracted from a form extraction system, a disparate user (e.g., customer service representative, agent, etc.), obtained from a data store, or an associated profile and from any trusted source of data.","At , a set of data sources is searched for information regarding the user based on the identifying data received. The data sources can include virtually any open source or publicly available sources of information, including but not limited to websites, search engine results, social networking websites, online resume databases, job boards, government records, online groups, payment processing services, online subscriptions, and so forth. In addition, the data sources can include private databases, such as credit reports, loan applications, and so forth. At , a profile of candidate characteristics (profile) can be initially populated in a memory of the system based on the search results. The profile of candidate characteristics (metadata) can include data from the search results that corresponds, correlates, or otherwise matches a set of predetermined characteristics for determining offer eligibility.","At , the identifying data provided to obtain the search results is modified with search data from the profile. The modification can alter, augment, or otherwise reconfigured data stored in the profile. In other words, data stored (metadata) in the profile of the client is selected to augment\/modify the original identifying data. The data can be used to further enhance the search for client data and further iteratively and dynamically update the client profile at each cycle of augmentation\/modification of the identifying data initially searched. At , the search is continued with data sources as before for information pertaining to the client with the modified\/augmented identifying data. Relationships among the metadata and frequency of occurrences are analyzed and used to provide a validity measure in which a creditworthiness score is determined. For example, where the information obtained about the client has a high validity and relevance to the client's credit score, a confidence or reliability score can be determined that results in a corresponding suitable loan offer to be recommended for the potential client.","At , the metadata or characteristics of the potential client stored in a client profile are updated according to the iterative searching of newly modified\/augmented identification data. The validation measures associated with metadata of the profile are also updated according to metadata's strength of association with new search results from the modified\/augmented identification data. Examples of metadata pertinent to client identifying data may be factors or attributed related to the person of the client, information from public sources, behavioral patterns, interests, etc., such as age, dependents (kids), spouse profession, area\/region of employment, applicant income, spouse income, area\/region of residence, homeownership\/home value, phone number, years at current residence, years at current job, years client of financial institution issues a loan, credit\/debit account availability, hobby, interests, preferences, internet activity statistics, payment delinquency, financial failures, and the like. The metadata may be information used as identifying data initially as well as searched results discovered and\/or updated for each iterative search cycle.","The client profile is dynamically analyzed to determine the accuracy of the information included in the profile, and the relevancy of the information to determine eligibility for a client offer. The accuracy is determined by comparing the information to other known information, or additional search results, and generating a validation score indicating a confidence level of the information based at least in part on the comparison. If the validity score is within a predetermined confidence threshold or range, then the information is determined to have a high level of accuracy. Additionally or alternatively, the validation score can be generated based at least in part on whether the data satisfies a set of verification criterion. The relevancy of the information to the offer eligibility determination is determined based at least in part on a set of offer criterion. For example, the set of offer criterion for a loan can include a set of predetermined characteristics, such as age, gender, profession, income, residence, education, debt, and so forth, and if the data information included in the profile correlates to the criterion, then it is deemed relevant to a degree. Consequently, a loan offer or other financial product can be presented to a client based on the validity of information publicly available and relevancy of the data compiled.",{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0056","num":"0055"},"figref":"FIG. 4","b":["208","402","404","406","208","106","402","404"]},"For example,  illustrates a graph  that provides for different search queries (e.g., Q, Q, and Q). Q initiates with a set of identifying data that is searched and that relates to a potential client. The search results found are M and M and an initial validation score is determined by as 0.8 and 0.6 at each relationship, as indicated by the lines connecting Q with M and M.","For example, an initial search cycle based on keywords or identifying data using the name: Jack Smith, data of birth: 26 Jan. 1916 and email: address@email.com. The results returned a new email address, a pseudo-name from a social network, an alias, a blog nickname, a service username, and\/or any other character data related. Subsequently, in a further search (e.g., Q, Q, etc.) the results are employed to modify the existing data in Q or add to the data already stored from previous search results.","Subsequently, Q is a modified search that is performed with augmented or changed identifying data or search terms. In other words, new information resulting from M and M may supplement the identifying data or search terms used in Q. Alternatively, Q is updated data resulting from a search with Q, such as a new address or the like. Each data is relevant to different degrees to the creditworthiness of the potential client, and thus, is searched to determine and iteratively increase improve the validity and accuracy. Subsequently, Q is searched and returns M, M and also M pieces of data related to the searched information data. According, to the different relationships analyzed by the relationship indicator , the validation score engine  provides a scored to each relationship, and\/or to each a piece of metadata M, M and M. In addition, each new search, such as M further improves the calculation and either confirms the validity or negates the metadata discovered as not valid. In addition, scores may change not only as new data is discover (e.g., M), but also as data from previous results has a difference in frequency in relation to the identifying data in used in the search or is further related to other metadata either used as search terms or stored in the profile of the client.","For example, before each new search cycle is started, the new attributes or related metadata affiliated to the potential client needs to be confirmed. This may be done by assigning a rating to each match. A higher rating or validation score from the validation engine  indicates a higher level of certainty that information belongs to the search subject and is valid. For example, an email address is a unique ID, therefore, if discovered that a user profile includes the same email address, there is a very high level of certainty attributed to the email address. Alternatively, matching a name or date of birth offers considerably low level of certainty. However, matching the name and the date of birth improves the quality of the match. Similarly, although a username usually is a unique ID within the same domain, it may belong to a different entity at a different domain. Although matching a name, date of birth and the username from two different domains provides very high probability that one and the other entities are the same.","Referring again to , the update component  can modify, alter, or otherwise update the set of keywords, the metadata stored in client profiles, the validation measures or scores, and\/or the set of data sources  based at least in part on the set of search results returned by the query component . For example, where search results contain an alias employed by the client , and the update component  can include the alias in the set of keywords. As an additional example, the update component  can update the set of sources  based on information, such as an additional email address returned by the query component  for the user . For instance, if the query component  locates an internet email address associated with the user , wherein the internet email is hosted by a first social networking site (e.g., user@1stsocialnetwork.com), then the update component  can include the first social networking site in the set of sources .","Turning now to , illustrated is an example advisor component  in accordance with various aspects described herein. The advisor component  is communicatively coupled to the profile analyzer  and provides feedback to the processing unit  where a user can receive output recommendations.","The advisor component  obtains data from the profiler analyzer . For example, the profile analyzer  generates a validation score that is based on the data relationships and\/or frequency of occurrence of data in the different search results with respect to metadata compiled in a client profile from each iterative search conducted. The validation score is thus interpreted by the advisor component  as a probability that the identifying data modified\/augmented with each new search is associated with the client. The validation score is used by the advisor component  to determine a reliability factor, in which the advisor used to factor a credit-worthiness score over time for a loan over or other financial product. The credit worthiness score may involve any number of factors and is not limited to only the reliability factor of the information gathered about the client, but in some embodiments may be factored only on the reliability factors and\/or validity scores. In response to the client profile being dynamically updated, as discussed above, the advisor component, for example, alters a loan offer or the recommendations outputted from the system based on the validity scores. Consequently, the advisor component  is configured to generate a loan offer to a potential client based on the client profile being dynamically updated from public available sources or sources that are always available on a network, such as a wide area network or the like.","Referring now to , illustrates an exemplary advisor component  of the system. The component  includes an extraction component , a credit-worthiness score component  and an offer component . Each component is communicatively coupled to one another to dynamically generate an output based upon a dynamically generated client profile regarding a potential client.","The extraction component  retrieves, obtains or otherwise extracts data from the profile analyzer. Data is also communicated to the advisor component  from the system , for example, and received at the extraction component . The extraction component  retrieves data needed to provide a recommended output to a user of the system. For example, a potential client may be provided a loan offer, a set of financial instruments approved for, and\/or a range of investment offers. The extraction component  communicates the data as an interface to the credit worthiness score component . A client's credit score is calculated at the credit-worthiness component based on the data dynamically updated in the client's profile and communicated by the extraction component . The score may be any scored weighted with different factors in an equation or algorithm as one of ordinary skill in the art will appreciate. For example, the validity and relevance of the data accumulated about the client is used as a factor or as the basis for a credit-worthiness score calculation. The offer component  then provides various terms, instruments, ranges, financial numbers and the like for presenting to the client.","Additionally, the offer component  intelligently determines or infers categorization of the profile , approval for one or more offers, or a set of terms for the offers. Any of the foregoing inferences can potentially be based upon, e.g., Bayesian probabilities or confidence measures or based upon machine learning techniques related to historical analysis, feedback, and\/or other determinations or inferences.","An example methodology  for implementing a method for a recommendation system is illustrated in . Reference is made to the figures described above for ease of description. However, the method  is not limited to any particular embodiment or example provided within this disclosure.","The method , for example, provides for a system to iteratively and dynamically search data regarding a potential client based on automatic augmentation or modification of the search terms (e.g., identifying data) related to the client while also dynamically and iteratively validating the data stored in a profile from each search. At  at profile is generated with candidate or client metadata, which is based upon search results of data that identifies the candidate. For example, the set of identifying data can include a first name, a last name, a date of birth, age, an email address, user name, domain name, geographical residence, telephone number, history and the like. As discussed previously, the identifying data can be received from the user, extracted from a form extraction system, a disparate user (e.g., customer service representative, agent, etc.), obtained from a data store, or an associated profile and from any trusted source of data.","At  validation measures are assigned to the metadata stored in the profile of the candidate. Relationships among the metadata and frequency of occurrences are analyzed and used to provide a validity measure in which a creditworthiness score can be determined. The validity measures provide for a means to determine the relevancy and accuracy For example, where the information obtained about the client has a high validity and relevance to the client's credit score, a confidence or reliability score can be determined that results in a corresponding suitable loan offer to be recommended for the potential client.","At , the data is modified such as by being altered, changed, augmented or subtracted from the initial identifying data in order to provide more accurate search results in an additional search. At , data sources are searched for additional or confirming information regarding the client based on the modified identifying data.","At , the client\/candidate metadata is updated and the validation measures corresponding thereto are also updated. At , the profile with the associated metadata having validity scores associated therewith is analyzed to determine validity and relevancy. The validity and relevance of the pieces of metadata is determined by comparing the information to other known information, or additional search results, and generating a confidence score for the information based at least in part on the comparison. If the confidence score is within a predetermined confidence threshold, then the information is determined accurate. Additionally or alternatively, the confidence score can be generated based at least in part on whether the data satisfies a set of verification criterion. The relevancy of the information to the offer eligibility determination is determined based at least in part on a set of offer criterion. For example, the set of offer criterion for a loan can include a set of predetermined characteristics, such as age, gender, profession, income, residence, education, debt, and so forth, and if the data information included in the profile correlates to the criterion, then it is relevant.","Exemplary Networked and Distributed Environments","One of ordinary skill in the art can appreciate that the various non-limiting embodiments of the shared systems and methods described herein can be implemented in connection with any computer or other client or server device, which can be deployed as part of a computer network or in a distributed computing environment, and can be connected to any kind of data store.
