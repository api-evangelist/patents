{"@attributes":{"id":"description"},"RELAPP":[{},{}],"heading":["CROSS REFERENCE TO RELATED APPLICATION","U.S. GOVERNMENT INTEREST","FIELD OF THE DISCLOSURE","BACKGROUND OF THE DISCLOSURE","SUMMARY OF THE DISCLOSURE","DETAILED DESCRIPTION"],"p":["This application is a continuation-in-part of application Ser. No. 12\/582,946 which had been filed on Oct. 21, 2009, now abandoned which previous application in itself claims the benefit of U.S. Provisional Patent Application Ser. No. 61\/108,092 filed Oct. 24, 2008 the complete file wrappers of all of which applications are hereby incorporated by reference as though fully set forth at length herein.","The inventions described herein may be manufactured, used and licensed by or for the U.S. Government for U.S. Government purposes.","This disclosure relates generally to an enhanced hand grenade.","Fragmentation hand grenades have a casing typically made of cast iron or steel which\u2014when the grenade is detonated\u2014spread fragments in all directions. These fragmentation patterns from such grenades are somewhat unpredictable due\u2014in part\u2014to their construction, their orientation when detonated, and external obstacles or other irregularities such as terrain, etc. As can be readily appreciated they are generally unsuitable for non-lethal application.","An advance is made in the art according to an aspect of the present disclosure directed to an enhanced grenade that provides a more predictable and reliable fragmentation pattern. Additionally, grenades constructed according to the present disclosure may advantageously be made suitable for non-lethal applications. Still further grenades constructed according to the present disclosure are particularly well-suited for use with insensitive-munitions (IM) energetic or environmentally-friendly energetic materials.","In one exemplary embodiment a number of shaped fragments are disposed in a volumetric area between an outer shell and an inner shell of the grenade, substantially fixed in place by a filler material. Advantageously, the fragments may be a variety of shapes, sizes, materials. A quantity of energetic material is disposed within the inner shell and detonated by a fuze. Upon detonation, the fragments scatter. Prior to detonation, the inner shell contains the energetic material and contributes to an insensitive munitions (IM) characteristic of the grenade.","In another exemplary embodiment, the fragments and shell(s) are constructed of materials\u2014for example plastic, rubber, composites, etc) such that a substantially non-lethal device is produced. Variation(s) of this embodiment may employ paint or other marking materials such that the non-lethal device is useful for marking an area or target(s). Advantageously, variations of these non-lethal embodiments are particularly well-suited to training applications.","In still another exemplary embodiment, the outer shell and fragment(s) are a substantially unitary composite structure. As a result, a robust, effective grenade exhibiting particularly desirable IM characteristics is produced.","The following merely illustrates the principles of the disclosure. It will thus be appreciated that those skilled in the art will be able to devise various arrangements which, although not explicitly described or shown herein, embody the principles of the disclosure and are included within its spirit and scope.","Furthermore, all examples and conditional language recited herein are principally intended expressly to be only for pedagogical purposes to aid the reader in understanding the principles of the disclosure and the concepts contributed by the inventor(s) to furthering the art, and are to be construed as being without limitation to such specifically recited examples and conditions.","Moreover, all statements herein reciting principles, aspects, and embodiments of the disclosure, as well as specific examples thereof, are intended to encompass both structural and functional equivalents thereof. Additionally, it is intended that such equivalents include both currently-known equivalents as well as equivalents developed in the future, i.e., any elements developed that perform the same function, regardless of structure.","Thus, for example, it will be appreciated by those skilled in the art that the diagrams herein represent conceptual views of illustrative structures embodying the principles of the disclosure.","In the claims hereof any element expressed as a means for performing a specified function is intended to encompass any way of performing that function. The invention as defined by such claims resides in the fact that the functionalities provided by the various recited means are combined and brought together in the manner which the claims call for. Applicants thus regards any means which can provide those functionalities as equivalent as those shown herein. Finally, and unless otherwise explicitly specified herein, the drawings are not drawn to scale.","Generally, a modern hand grenade comprises a cast iron or steel body which holds an explosive charge and a fuze assembly. The fuze assembly further comprises a detonator which ignites the charge, a time delay train leading to the detonator, a primer, a striker, a striker spring, a safety lever and a safety pin. The striker is in a cocked position from the time of manufacture with the striker spring under tension. A catch at one end of the safety lever restrains the striker so long as the lever is held against the body of the grenade while the safety pin secures the position of the safety lever until the pin is pulled.","Operationally, the grenade may be held in a throwing hand with the safety lever held against the body of the grenade. The safety pin is then removed. As the safety lever releases\u2014as a result of throwing the grenade for example\u2014the striker is released which impacts the primer thereby initiating the time delay train. The time delay train begins burning at one end and the burning progresses toward the opposite end at a relatively low rate of travel. After a predetermined period of time, the burning reaches the detonator, the detonator fires and ignites the explosive charge causing the body of the grenade to explode, scattering fragmented shrapnel over a target area.",{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0021","num":"0020"},"figref":["FIG. 1","FIG. 1"],"b":["100","100","110","120","130","140","120","130","150","130","120","140","160"]},"As can be appreciated, when operated the fuze ignites the energetic material which burns and generates a quantity of very high pressure gas which in turn forces the inner shell  outward toward the balls  and the outer shell  until the pressure becomes so great as to cause the structure to explode. As a result of this explosion, the balls (fragments) , along with fragments of the shells and other structures are scattered over the target area at high velocity.","At this point those skilled in the art will appreciate that the use of balls  as fragments provides a number of distinct advantages. First, their uniform shape and size offer a more predictable fragmentation pattern than prior art \u201cpineapple\u201d grenades. Additionally, since they (the balls) generally remain intact and distinct from one another, the number of active fragments is quite predictable. In sharp contrast, a conventional fragmentary grenade may fragment into only a small number of active fragments upon detonation.","While to this point fragments of uniform shape\/size have been shown, it is understood that the shapes\/sizes\/material\/packing\/orientation of the fragments may be varied and\/or adjusted at the time of manufacture to meet certain application requirements.","As can be readily appreciated, when constructed from metallic components a grenade according to the present invention may be particularly lethal. In particular, balls  constructed from bismuth, steel, iron or other suitably hard materials may produce a particularly lethal grenade when coupled with a steel shell and energetic material comprising high explosives such as TNT and\/or HDX\/RDX or variations thereof. Of course, the particular materials chosen for the shell, the balls and the energetic are variable depending upon the particular application for the grenade.","The filler material \u2014which may comprise any of a variety of materials i.e., plastics, epoxies, urethanes, etc., holds the balls in their relative positions until the device is activated. As a result of this filler, balls  of a variety of sizes may be used within a single grenade. In this manner, no shifting or settling of the balls will occur prior to activation. Additionally, when the filler material exhibits an elastic characteristic, enhanced IM characteristics may result.","Of particular interest is the inner shell  which separates the energetic material from the balls (shaped fragments) . Operationally, the inner shell  advantageously isolates the energetic material from the balls . In this manner, the energetic material is contained and isolated from external shock\/temperature, etc, which could initiate an unintended detonation. In this inventive manner, the inner shell  advantageously isolates the energetic material resulting in a device exhibiting greater insensitivity to external shock and the benefits associated with insensitive munitions. In addition, the inner shell may be somewhat elastic, thereby absorbing initial shocks as well. Lastly, the inner shell may include micro-voids (or pressure absorbing objects) in its structure (see , A) which\u2014when coupled with desirable materials\u2014provide a \u201cshock absorber\u201d from external shock and during detonation thereby enhancing the IM characteristics and limiting any damage\/deforming of the fragments during detonation. Accordingly, the inner shell may be constructed from a variety of plastic and\/or metallic materials including plastic, rubber, aluminum, etc.  in a more detailed cross-sectional view of a further exemplary enhanced hand grenade according to the present disclosure shows exemplary such micro-voids  in inner shell , while  shows exemplary such micro-voids  in inner shell .","Notably, if the grenade is exposed to high temperature\u2014for example in a fire\u2014the inner shell may serve to contain the energetic material even beyond that temperature at which the energetic melts. Accordingly, the inner shell contributes to the IM characteristic from shock and temperature extremes as well. And additionally, presence of micro-voids in the inner shell walls can also serve to better contain pressure within the shell because the shell walls also could then compress somewhat more under the pressure.","Of additional significance the shells may be constructed to melt when exposed to high temperatures thereby releasing\/ejecting the fuze assembly (see , A) such that the energetic materials are not detonated explosively. In another embodiment,  fuze assembly  is shown having an exemplary shaft  joined into inner shell ; shaft  may be of plastic. The shaft  may be threaded (as illustrated) and the inner shell then made to have mating internal threads. The shaft material and shell material have a different heat expansion rate. In the event of unexpected heat, fire, explosion, the shaft would tend to separate from the shell to release pressure. The energetic materials within the shell are such that they will not ignite (or properly ignite) unless there is gaseous pressure in the inner shell area, so the energetic material will therefore not ignite. The hole diameter in the inner shell that is around the shaft might expand faster than the shaft diameter would, and such would tend to release the fuze within the inner shell . This enhances IM qualities of the grenade, since the energetic materials within won't ignite without necessary pressure, and also can prevent fratricide of adjacent grenades. In another possible embodiment, there is a fuze gasket between shaft  and inner shell , e.g., which gasket is made of a high thermal expansion coefficient material such as UHMV, PVS, Polycarbonate. An ignition tube  extending through the shaft  may also be included, here shown extending into energetic material  to aid in ignition thereof. ( shows analogous structure with a shaft  of fuze assembly  joined to inner shell , and having extending ignition tube  to aid in igniting energetic material ). In a yet other embodiment, the spherical shaped inner shell (with micro-voids or pressure absorbing objects) is next immediately enclosed by a spherical shaped pusher plate component of defined thickness and density to optimize fragment velocity and reliably achieve repeatable results. The outer surface of the pusher plate (or alternatively the inner surface of the outer shell component) can be coated with an ablative and blast absorber coating such as E-340AF, F-100E, or S886. The inner shell can also be made to have ablative properties which absorb heat\/endothermic reaction, and the inner shell can also be made to have multiple densities, layered to absorb shock response. Next surrounding the pusher plate can be a spherically shaped void area to retard heat transfer to the next element which would then be the outer shell. The depth of this void area is comparable to the thickness of the inner shell or of a pusher plate. The purpose of the pusher plate is to magnify the blast coming from within the inner shell to increase explosive efficiency whereas the purpose of the ablative coating is to absorb heat, requiring more heat to melt through than if the ablative coating were not present. The void retards heat transfer also; it is like the void in double paned glass, e.g. The energetic material may also include aluminized filler for increased blast effects. The outer shell can also include filler material which is reactive if needed to initiate RM pellets or inert to buffer and prevent the RM from initiating and increasing the RM pellets range. With all these methods, the blast required to build up to burst out this grenade is increasingly magnified over the conventional grenade. While a grenade is usually anti-personnel this grenade could be powerful enough to be used on hard targets as well. Or alternatively, by adjusting or eliminating from the above mentioned features judiciously, one could make the grenade less lethal (rather than more potent), even less lethal than a conventional anti-personnel grenade. Thus this new grenade configuration provides the designer with great flexibility as to lethality. As mentioned before, the outer shell contains fragments embedded in plastic, which fragments scatter when the outer shell ruptures. Also contained in the outer shell and also around the fragments may be nano particles, included for enhanced blast effect. The outer shell may be covered by a low melting temperature plastic that melts away in a fire, e.g., which may release the fragments. During manufacture, the fragments for the outer shell may be held in place e.g. all equally spaced by a magnetic field, or else held by magnetic fields spatially in desired areas, until they can all be molded, casted, or overmolded in place. The fragments ideally should be close packed as much as possible to prevent blow by (when the grenade bursts) which would lead to lower fragment velocity. Alternatively, fragments may even be made of organic material including wood; the density of the wood can further be varied by mineralizing, water-logging the wood with heavy mineral solutions, or with heavy water. In the  example of this enhanced grenade, there is shown an enhanced grenade with inner shell  having micro-voids ; a pusher plate  surrounding the inner shell; an ablative coating  on the outer surface of the pusher plate; a void area  between pusher plate  and outer shell . Outer shell here has fragments . The handle-fuze mechanism  has a plastic shaft  leading down into the energetic material , whereas the shaft  is surrounded by a plastic gasket  which is in outer shell .","At this point it is notable that while the discussion so far has involved using ball-shaped fragments, those skilled in the art will of course recognize that the invention is not so limited. In particular, the fragments may be ball-shaped (as already discussed) or not. More particularly, they may be balls, cubes, or nearly any shape including star shaped, etc as dictated by the particular application. As with the ball-shaped fragments however, these non-ball shaped fragments may be a uniform size or non-uniform size as the application dictates. Finally, the fragments may be a mix of shapes\/sizes as well. In this manner and as used in this disclosure, a fragment is simply an object of any shape that is scattered upon detonation.","It is also noted that while the overall shape of the enhanced grenade has been substantially spherical, it is noted that the invention is not so limited. In particular, the grenade shape and its outer shell may be cylindrical, pyramidal, cubic etc or variations thereof. It is noted further that the inner and outer shells need not be the same shape. By way of example, a substantially spherical inner shell may be within a cubic outer shell. A variety of combinations of inner\/outer shell shape combinations are contemplated. The only requirement is that the inner shell fit inside the outer shell for these configurations.","It is also noted that the materials from which the fragments (balls, etc) are constructed may be varied. In particular, bismuth, steel, aluminum, copper and alloys\/variations are contemplated. In addition, ceramic materials are contemplated for fragment construction as well. Finally, explosive and\/or reactive fragments are contemplated as being used according to the present disclosure as well. In this inventive manner, the grenade explodes scattering the reactive and\/or explosive fragments which may enhance the effectiveness against the particular target. Reactive fragments may take a variety of forms. As shown in , a reactive fragment might be a one piece metal fragment  joined to an explosive material piece ; or the explosive fragment may be for instance spherical like as in  where a metal piece is at the center and is surrounded by an explosive material. Or, the explosive fragment may be all explosive material such as thermite in , and might be disc shaped; further, a select number of such explosive fragments may be designed to be clumped together. As described above, fragments may be mixed and varied in size, shape, materials, reactive, etc within a single grenade. Finally, fragments may be selectively positioned within the grenade to effect a particular fragmentation pattern or enhance its effectiveness against a particular target or targets.","Finally, it is contemplated that grenades according to the present disclosure may be used for training purposes. In this manner, the grenade will contain an energetic material (or not) that does not produce the scattering of fragments. For example, energetic that simply produce a flash or a bang or smoke but insufficient energy to generate an explosion and\/or fragmentation of an outer shell are within the scope of the present disclosure. Accordingly, they may be used for training purposes without the danger of an unintended injury.","As can now be appreciated, if the outer shell  and the balls  as well as the inner shell  are selectively constructed from non-lethal components\u2014for example plastics or rubber, etc then a substantially non-lethal device may be constructed. Such a device may employ alternative combinations of energetic material as required to emphasize the non-lethal aspect of this variation. In addition to these particular non-lethal materials, it is contemplated that paint\u2014or other marking\u2014fragments may be employed in both live-fire battlefield and training environments. In a battlefield environment, the grenade may be used to \u201cmark\u201d a target or area while in a training situation it may be used to indicate a hit on a target.",{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0035","num":"0034"},"figref":["FIG. 2","FIG. 2"],"b":["1","220","240","245","230","240","220"]},"Again, it is noted that the particular materials, shapes, and compositions are variable. Accordingly, the overall shape of the grenade  need not be substantially spherical as shown in this exemplary . Also, the fragments may be any shape as desired and a grenade according to an aspect of the present disclosure may include a variety of fragments exhibiting different shapes\/sizes\/materials\u2014all disposed within the unitary outer shell . In particular, the fragments may be different shapes\/sizes , ,  in multiple layers  within the shell .","At this point, while we have discussed and described the invention using some specific examples, those skilled in the art will recognize that our teachings are not so limited. More particularly the overall shape of the grenade may be any of a variety as desired, i.e sphere, cube, pyramid or variations\/perturbations thereof. The shaped fragments may be any shape including cubes, hex-shaped, stars, etc, and constructed from any of a variety of materials including metals, plastic, marking, ceramic and\/or reactive. The outer shell and\/or inner shell may be constructed from materials that melt upon extreme temperature, thereby permitting the gradual release of energetic material without exploding. The shell(s) may be unitary, composite structures wherein the fragments are secured within the body of the composite shell. The fuze may be mechanical\/chemical\/electronic or combinations thereof as necessary. Finally, the fragments may be positioned within or around the structure thereby changing terminal effects of the device and enhancing its effectiveness against persons\/property\/materials. Finally, grenades constructed according to the disclosure may be placed such that they are activated via trip-wire or the like, or thrown by hand, or launched via gun-mounted or other launcher including rocket. Accordingly the invention should be only limited by the scope of the claims attached hereto."],"GOVINT":[{},{}],"BRFSUM":[{},{}],"brief-description-of-drawings":[{},{}],"description-of-drawings":{"heading":"BRIEF DESCRIPTION OF THE DRAWING","p":["A more complete understanding of the present disclosure may be realized by reference to the accompanying drawings in which:",{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0011","num":"0010"},"figref":["FIG. 1","FIG. 1A"]},{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0012","num":"0011"},"figref":["FIG. 2","FIG. 2A"]},{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0013","num":"0012"},"figref":"FIG. 3"}]},"DETDESC":[{},{}]}
