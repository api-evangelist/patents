title: Method and system for creating a concept-object database
abstract: Embodiments of the present invention are directed to acquiring information from the worldwide web, organizing information acquired from the worldwide web, and using the acquired and organized information to facilitate web-page searching, web-page browsing, and other worldwide-web-based activities. In one embodiment of the present invention, a database of concept objects is created from an initial set of semantic objects and from hyperlink information obtained from web pages by one or more web crawlers. The initial set of semantic objects is processed using hyperlink based objects created by the web crawler. The processed semantic objects are then associated with additional hyperlink-based objects to create a concept-object database. In certain embodiments of the present invention, the concept-object database can be further refined and supplemented in an automated fashion by additional web crawling, subsequent association of hyperlink-based objects with concept objects, and creation of new concept objects as well as by user input to, and editing of, the concept-object database. The concept-object database may be employed, in various embodiments of the present invention, to facilitate web browsing, web-page searching, and other worldwide-web-base activities.

{"@attributes":{"id":"description"},"BRFSUM":[{},{}],"heading":["TECHNICAL FIELD","BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION","SUMMARY OF THE INVENTION","DETAILED DESCRIPTION OF THE INVENTION"],"p":["The present invention is related to the worldwide web and the Internet, automated acquisition of semantic-level knowledge from electronically stored data, electronically interconnected data-storage and data-display devices, and, in particular, to a method and system for creating a database of concept objects that reflect semantic knowledge gleaned from electronically encoded text documents and hyperlinked text documents.","Development of the Internet, during the past 30 years, development and widespread adoption of personal computers during the past 25 years, and development of the HyperText Markup Language (\u201cHTML\u201d) and web browsers, during the 1990's, has led to rapid development of the worldwide web. The worldwide web is a distributed repository of information encoded in HTML documents and various types of audio, video, graphical, application-specific, and other files, data, and executables referenced from HTML documents. HTML documents are accessed by users from hundreds of thousands of web-page servers distributed throughout the world and are rendered for graphical display as web pages by web browsers running on the users' computers. Development of the worldwide web has, in turn, spawned enormous commercial activity through on-line stores and trading communities and through development of powerful and enormously commercially successful information-acquisition tools, such as the Yahoo and Google search engines. Few technical advances have had greater and more immediate social and commercial impact.","The stunning success and rapid adoption of the worldwide web has also spawned a number of technological problems. Although the worldwide web is now a vast repository of millions of documents related to almost every possible topic, the information contained within the millions of HTML documents, and media files referenced from the HTML documents, is largely unstructured. Current search tools, including the Yahoo and Google search engines, provide keyword and key-symbol searches made possible by vast indexes of compiled word-and-symbol occurrences within web pages. These indexes are created and continuously supplemented by constant, automated access of web pages, parsing of the accessed web pages to extract words and symbols contained within the web pages, and creation of, and addition of data to, large, electronic databases that index the web pages by word and symbol occurrence. While keyword searches are powerful tools for finding information within the millions of HTML documents that reside within the worldwide web, keyword and key-symbol searching is typically imprecise. A keyword search often returns hundreds, thousands, or even greater numbers of undesired HTML documents and, at the same time, often fails to find large numbers of HTML documents that pertain to subject matter to which the keyword search is directed. Keyword searching may also be difficult to incorporate within other web-page browsing activities related to information acquisition from web pages.","These well-recognized and increasingly user-perceptible deficiencies in keyword searching have led to many different proposals for reorganizing the worldwide web and\/or accessing information stored within the worldwide web. Certain of the proposals would require massive and fundamental changes to the current structure of, and information-encoding used in, the worldwide web. Others involve sophisticated machine-learning and semantic-knowledge-acquisition tools, practical implementations of which are not yet available. However, with the number of documents contained within the worldwide web increasing at an exponential rate, information-organization and information-access tools that lead to more immediate improvements in organizing and accessing information stored within the worldwide web are currently needed by worldwide web users, web-browser developers, and developers and vendors of myriad application programs, commercial electronic marketplaces, and other applications and venues that rely on information stored within the worldwide web.","Embodiments of the present invention are directed to acquiring information from the worldwide web and other electronic-data repositories, organizing information acquired from the worldwide web and other electronic-data repositories, and using the acquired and organized information to facilitate web-page searching, web-page browsing, other worldwide-web-based activities, and additional activities directed to searching, browsing, and analyzing stored electronic data. Embodiments of the present invention are generally directed to associating hyperlinks with concept objects in order to create concept databases.","In one, disclosed embodiment of the present invention, a database of concept objects is created from an initial set of semantic objects and from hyperlink information obtained from web pages by one or more web crawlers. The initial set of semantic objects is processed using hyperlink based objects created by the web crawler. The processed semantic objects are then associated with additional hyperlink-based objects to create a concept-object database. In certain embodiments of the present invention, the concept-object database can be further refined and supplemented in an automated fashion by additional web crawling, subsequent association of hyperlink-based objects with concept objects, and creation of new concept objects both automatically as well as by user input to, and editing of, the concept-object database. The concept-object database may be employed, in various embodiments of the present invention, to facilitate web browsing, web-page searching, and other worldwide-web-base activities; searching, browsing, and analysis of various types of electronically-encoded information; and interconnect connectivity and semantic interoperability via a wide variety of communications-based applications and devices.",{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0029","num":"0028"},"figref":["FIG. 1","FIG. 2","FIG. 1","FIG. 1"],"b":["102","104","105","106","201","202","203","204","205"]},{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0030","num":"0029"},"figref":"FIG. 3","b":["302","304","312","306","310","302","304","314","304","316"]},"A fundamental structuring of information contained within the worldwide web occurs through hyperlinks that link web pages containing the hyperlinks to other web pages.  illustrates a hyperlink. On a rendered web page , a hyperlink  generally appears as a text caption, or anchor text, that indicates or describes a web page that can be viewed by controlling a cursor to overlie the text caption and inputting a mouse click, or other input, to the displayed anchor text of hyperlink . In the HTML document  that describes the web page, the hyperlink is represented as a text string  that includes the URL  of the linked HTML document  and the anchor text  that annotates the displayed hyperlink  in the rendered web page . Upon entering a mouse click or other user input to the displayed anchor text of hyperlink , the user's web browser is signaled to request the linked HTML document  from a remote web-page server. When the linked HTML document is received, the user's web browser renders and displays the linked HTML document  as rendered web page .",{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0032","num":"0031"},"figref":["FIG. 5","FIG. 5","FIG. 5","FIG. 5","FIG. 5"],"b":["501","502","504","501","506","509","510","518","501","520","522","524","531","501"]},{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0033","num":"0032"},"figref":"FIG. 6","b":["602","604","606"]},"The current web-page searching approach discussed with reference to , along with schemes for directing and ordering searches, in part in accordance with fees paid to search-engine companies by web-page providers, has proved enormously commercially successful for search-engine companies, and has provided an extremely useful tool to allow users of the Internet to find web pages related to topics and concepts of interest to the users. Search engines have revolutionized information access and information processing, providing immediate, electronic access to vast amounts of textural, graphical, audio, and video information stored within the worldwide web.","As discussed above, keyword-and-key-symbol-based searching has a number of shortcomings. First, keyword-and-key-symbol-based searching generally returns tens, hundreds, thousands, or more web pages with reasonably high, statistical correlation to input search terms. Keyword-and-key-symbol-based searching is therefore relatively imprecise, and often requires significant time and effort on the part of users to sift through and find desired web pages from massive returned search results. As users become more sophisticated, they learn techniques for refining and as precisely as possible specifying desired web pages in terms of key words and key symbols. However, keyword-and-key-symbol-based searching is inherently limited by the inability to precisely define and characterize a topic or concept using a relatively small number of words and symbols.","A more serious problem encountered by search-engine users is that natural language, and, in particular, the English language, is quite redundant, with many different words and phrases that describe the same topic or concept. For this reason, any particular keyword-and-key-symbol-based search may omit a number of related and synonymous terms and symbols, and a search based on the key word and key symbols may therefore often find only a subset of the total number of related and desired web pages. To effectively search the worldwide web, the user often needs to conduct many repeated keyword-and-key-symbol-based searches, varying terms, symbols, and combinations of terms and symbols in order to find an acceptable subset of the set of web pages related to a particular topic or concept. Many additional problems are associated with keyword-and-key-symbol-based searching. While natural language is both redundant and ambiguous, leading to under-inclusive and over-inclusive search results, natural language is also a poor vehicle for capturing many complex concepts and interrelationships. It is often the case that a very large and cumbersome list of key words and key symbols may be needed to adequately describe a concept, but as the length of the key word and key-symbol list increases, the likelihood of finding web pages that include a significant portion of the key words and key symbols correspondingly decreases.","One way to view all of the above-discussed problems with keyword-and-key-symbol-based searching, as well as many additional problems with web browsing and information retrieval from the worldwide web, is that current search engines lack semantic understanding and semantic knowledge of the information contained within the worldwide web. While they are effective at using discrete words and symbols, and statistical relationships between discrete words and symbols, to find candidate web pages based on a list of key words and key symbols viewed as discrete entities, search engines do not index by the semantics of formatted natural language text, and they do not correlate their collection of words and symbols with a semantic representation of a topic, concept, or user request. This underlying deficiency of current search engines has been recognized, and has stimulated a great deal of research on, and proposals for, new types of searching and new organizations and information-encodings for enhanced worldwide webs. Certain proposals are directed to tools for aggregating and processing unstructured worldwide-web-based information in order to more effectively use and search the unstructured information. Certain proposals are directed to more structured organizations of the worldwide web that would allow for more directed searches. These proposals include proposals for self-describing, more autonomous data objects that include extensive metadata to facilitate identifying relationships between data objects and automatic processing of the informational content of data objects. Still other proposals involved sophisticated natural-language processing and automated acquisition of semantic knowledge and semantic understanding of information encoded within the worldwide web.","Although many of the proposed enhancements and modifications of the worldwide web, and of searching techniques for finding web pages related to particular topics and concepts, have great merit, and may eventually lead to much better information organization and much more precisely directed searches for information contained within the worldwide web, there is a pressing need for immediate and practically implementable solutions to the various, above-described problems. Embodiments of the present invention are directed to methods and systems for constructing databases of concept objects that can be used to facilitate various aspects of web browsing, web-page searching, and other worldwide web-based activities that can lead to more effective, automated information acquisition and access based on the current, largely unstructured worldwide web.",{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0039","num":"0038"},"figref":["FIG. 7","FIG. 7"],"b":["702","704","706","708","710","712","714","716","718","708"]},{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0040","num":"0039"},"figref":"FIG. 8"},"A list of semantic objects, as shown in , represents a starting point for various method embodiments of the present invention. Each semantic object, such as semantic object , can be thought of as a data object or data record that includes two fields: (1) a URL ; and (2) a list of emergent terms and phrases, or tags . In many embodiments, additional fields may be present in the semantic object, some of which may not, at early stages, have values, or may have default values that are changed during the processes described below. The URL is referred to as a \u201cprimary link.\u201d Each semantic object therefore is associated with a web page that may be referenced via the primary link and that is associated with, and described by, the emergent terms and phrases, or tags. For example, the home page of a corporate web site, such as \u201chttp:\/\/www.acme.com,\u201d may be described by a semantic object that includes the URL of the home page of the corporate web site and emergent terms, such as the phrase \u201cAcme Corporation.\u201d In alternative embodiments, semantic objects may include additional fields, as well as a type field or type indicator, so that a list of semantic objects may include various sub-categories or sub-classifications of semantic objects and web pages represented by the semantic objects. For example, there may be corporate-web-page semantic objects corresponding to corporations, person semantic objects that describe particular people, research-article semantic objects that describe research articles, and any number of different types of semantic objects associated with different types of entities described by web pages. In many embodiments of the present invention, the acquisition of an initial list of semantic objects represents a first step in creation of a concept-object database.",{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0042","num":"0041"},"figref":["FIG. 9","FIG. 5"],"b":["902","904","902"]},{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0043","num":"0042"},"figref":["FIG. 10","FIG. 8","FIG. 9","FIG. 7"],"b":["402","904","404","402"]},{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0044","num":"0043"},"figref":["FIG. 11","FIG. 11"],"b":"1102"},"First-level objects are nascent concept objects that are identified as being significantly well referenced by web pages within the worldwide web and that have been well described by a title comprising terms and symbols obtained by statistical analysis of anchor text within the associated filtered-and-processed-hyperlink-object context of the first-level object. In the case that is decided to retain the currently considered semantic object, the currently considered semantic object is promoted to a \u201cfirst-level object\u201d and the first-level object is then additionally processed in the context of the associated filtered-and-processed hyperlinks.  illustrates the processing of a first-level object according to certain embodiments of the present invention. Anchor text contained in the associated filtered-and-processed hyperlinks is statistically analyzed in order to determine a dominant or prominent set of terms and symbols, referred to as \u201cemergent terms.\u201d The processing steps  are thus mainly directed to associating a hyperlink-based object with emergent terms most descriptive of the first-level object , and updating the first-level object to associate the first-level object with the emergent terms. When the iterative filtering and processing of semantic objects within the context of associated filtered-and-processed hyperlink-based objects is complete, a database of first-level objects is obtained. These first-level objects are nascent concept objects that are identified as being significantly well referenced by web pages within the worldwide web and that have been well described by a title comprising terms and symbols obtained by statistical analysis of anchor text within the associated filtered-and-processed-hyperlink-object context of the first-level object.","Next, a second iterative procedure can be carried out in which each first-level object is again considered, in the second iterative process within the context of related filtered-and-processed hyperlink-based objects. Related filtered-and-processed hyperlink-based objects include not only filtered-and-processed hyperlink-based objects that directly reference the considered first-level object, but, in addition, those filtered-and-processed hyperlink-based objects with anchor text related to the emergent terms by which the considered first-level object is tagged.  illustrates a next-considered first-level object in a second iterative processing step considered within the context of related filtered-and-processed hyperlink-based objects. As shown in , the currently considered first-level object  is related to a set of filtered-and-processed hyperlink-based objects - that directly reference the currently considered first-level object , and is also related to a second set of filtered-and-processed hyperlink-based objects - with normalized anchor text related to the emergent terms by which the currently considered first-level object is tagged. A determination of the relatedness of normalized anchor text to a first-level object's emergent terms may be made by matching and terms and symbols in the anchor text with the terms and symbols by which the first-level object is tagged. Additional considerations related to statistical orderings and rankings of terms and symbols may be made.","Having established, for each currently considered first-level object, the filtered-and-processed-hyperlink-object context as shown in , the currently considered first-level object may be then additionally processed and promoted to a concept object. Additional processing may involve refining the first-level object's emergent terms using normalized anchor text in the expanded context of filtered-and-processed hyperlink-based objects. In certain embodiments, the context may be additionally expanded to include the web pages from which the filtered-and-processed-hyperlink-based objects were extracted in order to add additional information to the first-level objects. For example, when first-level objects are classified by type, the values for additional type-specific fields may be determined at this stage of the process. As one example, if the first-level object represents a literary work, the first-level object may include additional fields for author, publisher, and publication date. The values for these fields may be obtained from the web pages from which the filtered-and-processed-hyperlink-based objects associated with the first-level object were extracted and\/or from the web page referenced by the primary link contained in the first-level object, or from other sources.","Next, a decision is made for each filtered-and-processed hyperlink-based object within the expanded context of the first-level object as to whether the filtered-and-processed hyperlink-based object should be associated with the first-level object by a secondary link. This decision may be based on a large variety of different considerations and on various types of accumulated data. For example, the decision to create a secondary link between the first-level object and a filtered-and-processed hyperlink-based object may, in part, be based on the uniqueness of any proper names in the anchor text of the hyperlink-based object that match proper names in the emergent terms associated with the concept object. Statistical rankings and orderings of common anchor-text and object-associated terms and symbols may additionally be employed to judge the relatedness and the value of the hyperlink to the first-level object. In more elaborate embodiments, web pages from which the hyperlink-based objects are extracted may be accessed and analyzed to further characterize the relatedness and value of the hyperlink-based object to the first-level object. Finally, the first-level object is promoted to a concept object and stored in the concept-object database, along with secondary links to related hyperlink-based objects deemed to be of sufficient relatedness in value to be associated with the concept object in a concept-object database.",{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0049","num":"0048"},"figref":"FIG. 14","b":["1402","1403","1404","1405","1406","1407","1408","1409","1404","1405","1420","1425","1430","1435"]},"Details of the exact schemas and database systems and models for storing semantic objects, hyperlink-based objects, and concept objects are not provided in the current discussion for a number of reasons. First, databases and database schemas for storing relatively simple, multi-field data records or data objects are extremely well known. Relational databases, for example, are well known to be suitable for storing and query-based retrieval of simple data objects. Secondly, there are an essentially limitless number of different schemas and models that can be devised for storing semantic objects, hyperlink-based objects, and concept objects. For example, a concept-object database may include relational tables for concept objects, hyperlink-based objects, and secondary links. Alternatively, a concept-object database may be based on an object-oriented database in which stored concept objects reference stored hyperlink-based objects. Whatever the database model and schema used, it is assumed that a selection of efficient searching tools are provided by the database that allow for efficiently and precisely finding particular concept objects and hyperlink-based objects related to concept objects through secondary links. In the above described concept-object-database creation method, a set of semantic objects is transformed into a set of first-level objects, in turn transformed into a database containing concept objects. Semantic objects may be stored separately from first-level objects, and first-level objects maybe stored separately from concept objects. Alternatively, all three types of objects may share a common representation and be stored in a single object database, and the process of concept-object-database creation may comprise augmenting and refining the contents of the objects and filtering the set of objects to remove undesirable objects from the object database. Filtered-and-processed hyperlink-based objects may be stored separately from, or together with, semantic objects, first-level objects, and\/or concept objects. Rather than storing objects in a database, the objects may be stored in indexed flat files, or using other well-know techniques for storing data for subsequent access.","The initial concept-object database may be further refined and supplemented at subsequent points in time, or may be continuously refined and supplemented.  indicates one type of concept-object-database enhancement carried out in certain embodiments of the present invention. As shown in , tertiary links - that link concept objects and hyperlink-based objects to other hyperlink-based objects may be obtained from web pages associated with the concept objects and hyperlink-based objects, and analysis of the tertiary links may lead to a decision to promote  a particular hyperlink-based object  to a first-level object and perhaps to a concept object . This may provide for addition of concept objects, over time, to the concept-object database. Alternatively, various sources of semantic objects may be monitored in order to create, on an ongoing basis, additional semantic-object databases that can be merged, using a process such as that discussed above with reference to , with the original concept-object database. As filtered-and-processed hyperlink-based objects are discovered and added to subsequent filtered-and-processed-hyperlink-object databases, these subsequent hyperlink-object databases may be used to further refine concept objects in the concept-object database, by refining the emergent terms associated with the concept object and additional fields of the concept object, by adding additional fields to the concept object, and by adding additional secondary links to subsequently discovered filtered-and-processed hyperlink-based objects. Over time, meta-level objects that each represents a subset of the concept object stored in the concept-object database may be created and stored, in a meta-level object database or relational table, to provide additional indexes into the concept-object database. In alternative embodiments, users of a concept-object database, or of web browsers or search engines that use one or more concept-object database, may be provided tools to edit, add, and delete concept objects directly, or indirectly by providing information that is processed and used to edit, add, and delete concept objects by an automated process.",{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0052","num":"0051"},"figref":["FIG. 16","FIGS. 7-15","FIG. 9","FIG. 9","FIG. 8","FIGS. 10-12"],"b":["1602","1604","1606","1608","1610","1612"]},"Next, a simple Java-like pseudocode implementation of a concept-object-database creation process is provided.
