The side airbag  of the related art, which is shown in , has an airbag portion  for protecting a passenger from a side impact in an emergency case and an inflator  that supplies gas to inflate the airbag portion .","In addition, a shape having a plurality of air bag portions was known as the shape of an airbag of the related art. For example, Japanese Unexamined Patent Application Publication No. 2008-30620 describes a side airbag having two airbag portions and an inflator that supplies air to the two airbag portions at the top and bottom.","[Patent Literature 1] Japanese Unexamined Patent Application Publication No. 2008-30620","In recent years, there has been demand for a side airbag having a wide protection range so as to protect the shoulder to waist of a passenger in order to further improve the passenger protection performance. For example, the side airbag  of the related art, which is shown in , has the airbag portion  large enough to protect the shoulder to waist of a passenger. However, as shown in , if the size of the airbag portion  is simply increased, there are problems in that a necessary space is also increased, and the airbag portion cannot be stored in the backrest portion of a seat.","Therefore, an object of the invention is to provide a side airbag, a curtain airbag, and a back window airbag which can be accordingly and efficiently stored in a storage space.","In order to solve the problem, the invention is a side airbag stored in the backrest portion of a seat, having a first airbag which is inflated in a circular shape by gas supplied by an inflator provided in the backrest portion when seen from the side of the backrest portion; a second airbag provided so as to be located in the first airbag in an inflated state; and a communicating path that communicates the first airbag and the second airbag on the backrest portion side of the second airbag when seen from the side of the backrest portion, in which the second airbag has a vertical width set to be larger than the vertical width of the communication path, and at least the top portion, the bottom portion, and the front portion are separated from the first airbag when seen from the side of the backrest portion.","According to the side airbag of the invention, since at least the top portion, the bottom portion, and the front portion of the second airbag are separated from the first airbag in an inflated state, and the vertical width of the second airbag is set to be larger than the vertical width of the communicating path, the first airbag and the second airbag can be separately folded and stored in the backrest portion of the seat. According to the side airbag, since the storage place of the second airbag can be changed by the location of the communicating path, the storage place of the second airbag is specified according to the storage space in the backrest portion of the seat, and therefore the side airbag can be efficiently stored.","The side airbag according to the invention is, in a inflated state, preferably located on the seat's seating portion side or on the seat's headrest side of the central portion of the second airbag in the extension direction of the backrest portion when seen from the side of the backrest portion.","According to the side airbag of the invention, since there are frequent cases in which the storage space in the backrest portion is located closer to the seating portion side or the headrest side, the second airbag can be stored in a spacious location in the storage space by providing the communicating path on the seating portion side or the headrest side, and the side airbag can be efficiently stored.","The invention is a curtain airbag that is stored in the vehicle interior top side portion of a vehicle and inflates along a window of the vehicle, having a first airbag which is inflated in a circular shape by gas supplied by an inflator provided in a vehicle interior top side portion when seen from the side of the vehicle; a second airbag provided so as to be located in the first airbag in an inflated state; and a communicating path that communicates the first airbag and the second airbag on the top side of the vehicle, in which the second airbag has a horizontal width set to be larger than the horizontal width of the communication path when seen from the side of the vehicle, and at least the front portion, the rear portion, and the bottom portion are separated from the first airbag when seen from the side of the vehicle.","According to the curtain airbag of the invention, since at least the front portion, the rear portion, and the bottom portion of the second airbag are separated from the first airbag in an inflated state, and the horizontal width of the second airbag is set to be larger than the horizontal width of the communication path when seen from the side of the vehicle, the first airbag and the second airbag can be separately folded and stored in the top side portion of the vehicle interior. According to the curtain airbag, since the storage place of the second airbag can be changed by the location of the communicating path, the storage place of the second airbag is specified according to the storage space in the top side portion of the vehicle interior, and therefore the curtain airbag can be efficiently stored.","The invention is a back window airbag that is stored in the vehicle interior top rear portion of a vehicle and inflates along the back window of the vehicle when a collision is detected, having a first airbag which is inflated in a circular shape by gas supplied by an inflator provided in a vehicle interior top rear portion when seen from the front face of the vehicle; a second airbag provided so as to be located in the first airbag in an inflated state; and a communicating path that communicates the first airbag and the second airbag on the top side of the vehicle, in which the second airbag has a horizontal width set to be larger than the horizontal width of the communication path when seen from the front face of the vehicle, and has at least both side portions and the bottom portion separated from the first airbag when seen from the front face of the vehicle.","According to the back window airbag of the invention, since at least both side portions and the bottom portion of the second airbag are separated from the first airbag in an inflated state, and the horizontal width of the second airbag is set to be larger than the horizontal width of the communication path when seen from the front face of the vehicle, the first airbag and the second airbag can be separately folded and stored in the top rear portion of the vehicle interior. According to the back window airbag, since the storage place of the second airbag can be changed by the location of the communicating path, the storage place of the second airbag is specified according to the storage space in the top rear portion of the vehicle interior, and therefore the back window airbag can be efficiently stored.","According to the invention, it is possible to provide a side airbag, a curtain airbag, and a back window airbag which can be accordingly and efficiently stored in a storage space.","Hereinafter, a preferred embodiment of the invention will be described in detail with reference to the drawings.","As shown in , a side airbag  according to the present embodiment is a side airbag that is inflated when an impact occurs on a vehicle so as to prevent a passenger from the impact from the side of the vehicle. The side airbag  is normally stored in a backrest portion SA of a vehicle seat S. The side airbag  is inflated toward the front of the vehicle seat S by gas supplied by an inflator  provided in the backrest portion SA. The side airbag  has a size large enough to sufficiently cover the shoulder to waist of the passenger sitting on a seating portion SB of the vehicle seat S in an inflated state.","Hereinafter, the side airbag  in an inflated state will be described.","As shown in , the side airbag  has a dual airbag structure composed of a first airbag  outside and a second airbag  inside. The first airbag  in an inflated state forms a circular shape when seen from the side of the backrest portion SA shown in , and has the second airbag  located inside. The first airbag  and the second airbag  are connected with each other through a communicating path . The right and left side faces of the second airbag  are exposed outside, and the first airbag  covers the front and rear directions and the top and bottom directions of the second airbag .","The first airbag  in an inflated state does not come into contact with the second airbag , and an inner face of the first airbag  and an outer face of the second airbag  are separated from each other. A separating space N that separates the first airbag  and the second airbag  is formed between the inner face of the first airbag  and the outer face of the second airbag . The separating space N is formed so as to penetrate the side airbag  at the side of the backrest portion SA.","In addition, in the side airbag , the second airbag  is formed to be smaller than the first side airbag  when seen from the front direction of the backrest portion SA shown in . The first airbag  is provided to have a vertical width T shown in  larger than a vertical width T of the second airbag .","The second airbag  is divided into  portions of a top portion , a bottom portion , a front portion , and a rear portion when seen from the side of the backrest SA. The top portion , the bottom portion , and the front portion in the second airbag  are fully separated from the first airbag  in an inflated state.","In addition, the vertical width T of the second airbag  shown in  is provided to be larger than a vertical width T of the communicating path . Thereby, some of the rear portion of the second airbag  is also separated from the first airbag . Specifically, the part of the rear portion which is not in contact with the communicating path  is separated from the first airbag .","The first airbag  and the second airbag  are communicated through the communicating path . The inflator  is directly connected with the inside of the first airbag . Gas supplied by the inflator  is supplied to the inside of the second airbag  from the inside of the first airbag  through the communicating path .","The communicating path  is formed on the inflator  side of the second airbag  when seen from the side of the backrest SA shown in . In addition, the communicating path  is formed on the seating portion SB side of the second airbag . The communicating path  is located on the seating portion SB side of the central location of the second airbag  in an inflated state in the extension direction (approximately the vertical direction of the seat position in ) of the backrest portion SA when seen from the side of the backrest portion SA. Hereinafter, the extension direction of the backrest portion SA when seen from the side of the backrest portion SA is simply called the extension direction of the backrest portion SA.","In addition, the communicating path  is formed into a size in consideration of the storage properties of the side airbag . The communicating path  in an inflated state is formed to be smaller than the size of the second airbag  when seen from the front direction of the backrest portion SA shown in . The communicating path  is formed so as to be overlapped with the second airbag  in an inflated state when seen from the front direction of the backrest portion SA shown in .","Next, the sequence of storing the side airbag  in an uninflated state in the backrest portion SA will be described.",{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0036","num":"0035"},"figref":["FIG. 3","FIG. 1","FIG. 3","FIG. 3"],"b":["4","1","4","3","4","3","4"]},{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0037","num":"0036"},"figref":["FIG. 4","FIG. 4","FIG. 3","FIG. 4","FIG. 1"],"b":["4","4","4"]},{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0038","num":"0037"},"figref":["FIG. 5","FIG. 5","FIG. 4","FIG. 5"],"b":["1","3","4","5","4","5"]},"According to the side airbag  as described above, since the portion from the top portion , the bottom portion , the front portion , and the rear portion of the second airbag  when seen from the side of the backrest portion SA, which are not in contact with the communicating path , are separated from the first airbag , the first airbag  and the second airbag  can be separately folded and stored in the backrest portion SA. According to the side airbag , since the storage place of the second airbag  can be changed by the disposal location of the communicating path , the storage place of the second airbag  is specified according to the storage space of the backrest portion SA, whereby the side airbag  can be efficiently stored.","In addition, since the communicating path  is located on the seating portion SB side of the central location of the second airbag  in the extension direction of the backrest portion SA in an inflated state in the side airbag , the backrest portion SA of the seat is, in general, sufficiently large at the seating portion SB side that supports loads, and a storage space can be easily provided, whereby the second airbag  can be stored in the seating portion SB side of the backrest SA by providing the communicating path  on the seating portion SB side, and the side airbag  can be efficiently stored.","The invention is not limited to the above embodiment.","The invention can be applied to a curtain airbag or a back window airbag in addition to the above side airbag.","In addition, in the side airbag , the communicating path  may also be located on a vehicle seat S\u2032 headrest side of the central location of the second airbag  in the extension direction of the backrest portion SA in an inflated state. According to this configuration, the second airbag  can be stored in a location having a spacious storage space according to the backrest portion SA for which the storage space is closer to the headrest side, and the side airbag  can be efficiently stored.","In addition, the sizes or shapes of the first airbag  and the second airbag  are not necessarily limited to the above. Similarly, the size or shape of the communicating path  is also not limited to the above. The communicating path  may also be located on the headrest side instead of the seating portion side when a storage space can be secured on the headrest side of the backrest portion.
