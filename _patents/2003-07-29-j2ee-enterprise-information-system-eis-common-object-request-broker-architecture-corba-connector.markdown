Field of the Invention","The present invention relates to a Java 2 enterprise edition\u2014common object request broker architecture connector. More particularly, the present invention relates to a connector for managing common object request broker architecture connections from a Java 2 enterprise edition compliant application server to an enterprise information system.","2. Background Information","A client connected to an application server program through a computer network may request the services of an enterprise information system (EIS). For example, a client may be connected to a web application server program through the internet. The web application server program may enable the client to request the services of an external enterprise information system that provides the information infrastructure for an enterprise to clients of the enterprise. For example, an enterprise information system may offer a set of information services to clients of an enterprise.","Common object request broker architecture (CORBA) defines interfaces for each individual unit of running software that combines functionality and data, i.e., for each object. A client that wants to invoke an operation on an object must use the defined interface to specify the operation it wants to perform. For example, a service manager in a telecommunications environment may process only CORBA requests from a client to access and change service information.","Currently, vendor-specific architectures are used to integrate application servers and enterprise information systems. The Java 2 enterprise edition (J2EE) specification is being developed to define a standard architecture for integrating application servers and enterprise information systems. Nevertheless, even if J2EE is widely adopted, a legacy enterprise information system such as a telecommunications service manager may still process only CORBA requests from an application server program. If an application server program operates according to the J2EE architecture that is being developed, a J2EE\u2014CORBA connector will be required to establish and maintain CORBA connections with an enterprise information system. For example, a J2EE\u2014CORBA connector will be required to enable a J2EE compliant application server program to convey client requests to the legacy service manager.","Accordingly, a J2EE\u2014CORBA connector is required to integrate a J2EE compliant application server and a enterprise information system that uses CORBA. A customizable deployment descriptor is also required to customize the deployment and management of each CORBA connection. Moreover, a method of integrating the J2EE\u2014CORBA connector with the application server is required.","To fulfill the needs set forth above, a J2EE enterprise information system (EIS) common object request broker architecture (CORBA) connector is provided.","In view of the foregoing, the present invention, through one or more of its various aspects, embodiments and\/or specific features or sub-components, is thus intended to bring out one or more of the advantages as specifically noted below.","According to an aspect of the present invention, connections between a J2EE application server and a CORBA enterprise information system are managed. A resource adapter is integrated with the application server. The resource adapter includes an encapsulated CORBA interface to the enterprise information system. A persistent CORBA connection is established between the application server and the enterprise information system.","According to another aspect of the present invention, a request is received from an application component implemented by the application server. The application component requests the allocation of the persistent CORBA connection. A determination is made whether the persistent CORBA connection is available for allocation.","According to still another aspect of the present invention, the persistent CORBA connection to the application component is allocated when a persistent CORBA connection is available. The application component is informed that the CORBA connection is unavailable when the persistent CORBA connection is unavailable.","According to yet another aspect of the present invention, another persistent CORBA connection is established between the application server and the enterprise information system when the persistent CORBA connection is unavailable. The other persistent CORBA connection is allocated to the application component.","According to another aspect of the present invention, a message is received from the enterprise information system. The message indicates that the persistent CORBA connection is not active. In response to the message the persistent CORBA connection is terminated.","According to still another aspect of the present invention, the persistent CORBA connection is monitored to determine whether the persistent CORBA connection is active.","According to yet another aspect of the present invention, additional CORBA connections are established between the application server and the enterprise information system until a predetermined minimum number of CORBA connections are established. Additional CORBA connections are established between the application server and the enterprise information system until a predetermined maximum number of CORBA connections are established. After the predetermined minimum number of CORBA connections are established, a CORBA connection is established based on a determination that the previously established CORBA connections are unavailable. The determination is made in response to a request from an application server to allocate a CORBA connection.","According to an aspect of the present invention, connections between a J2EE application server and a CORBA enterprise information system are managed using a computer program stored on a computer readable medium. The computer readable medium includes an integrating source code segment that integrates a resource adapter with the application server. The resource adapter includes an encapsulated CORBA interface to the enterprise information system. The computer readable medium also includes a persistent CORBA connection establishing source code segment that establishes a persistent CORBA connection between the application server and the enterprise information system.","According to another aspect of the present invention, the computer readable medium also includes a request receiving source code segment that receives a request from an application component implemented by the application server. The application component requests the allocation of a persistent CORBA connection. The computer readable medium also includes an availability determining source code segment that determines whether the persistent CORBA connection is available for allocation.","According to still another aspect of the present invention, the computer readable medium includes a CORBA connection allocating source code segment that allocates the persistent CORBA connection to the application component when a persistent CORBA connection is available. The computer readable medium also includes a connection manager informing source code segment that informs the application component that the CORBA connection is unavailable when the persistent CORBA connection is unavailable.","According to yet another aspect of the present invention, the computer readable medium includes another persistent CORBA connection establishing source code segment. The another persistent CORBA connection establishing source code segment establishes another persistent CORBA connection between the application server and the enterprise information system when the persistent CORBA connection is unavailable. The computer readable medium also includes another CORBA connection allocating source code segment that allocates the other persistent CORBA connection to the application component.","According to another aspect of the present invention, the computer readable medium includes a message receiving source code segment that receives a message from the enterprise information system. The message indicates that the persistent CORBA connection is not active. The computer readable medium also includes a persistent CORBA connection terminating source code segment that terminates the persistent CORBA connection in response to receiving the message that the persistent CORBA connection is not active.","According to still another aspect of the present invention, the computer readable medium includes a monitoring source code segment that monitors the persistent CORBA connection to determine whether the persistent CORBA connection is active.","According to yet another aspect of the present invention, the computer readable medium includes a minimum CORBA connections establishing source code segment that establishes additional CORBA connections between the application server and the enterprise information system until a predetermined minimum number of CORBA connections are established. The computer readable medium also includes a maximum CORBA connections establishing source code segment that establishes additional CORBA connections between the application server and the enterprise information system until a predetermined maximum number of CORBA connections are established. A CORBA connection established after the predetermined minimum number of CORBA connections are established, is established based on a determination that the previously established CORBA connections are unavailable. The determination is made in response to a request from an application server for the allocation of a CORBA connection.","According to an aspect of the present invention, a J2EE compliant application server hosts a resource adapter for managing connections between the application server and a CORBA enterprise information system. The application server includes a processor that implements a customized deployment descriptor for deploying the resource adapter. The resource adapter includes an encapsulated CORBA interface for the enterprise information system. The resource adapter establishes a persistent CORBA connection between the application server and the enterprise information system.","According to still another aspect of the present invention, the application server includes a connection manager that processes a request to allocate the persistent CORBA connection. The request is received from an application component implemented by the application server. The application server determines whether the persistent CORBA connection is available for allocation in response to receiving the request.","According to yet another aspect of the present invention, the connection manager allocates the persistent CORBA connection to the application component when the persistent CORBA connection is available. The connection manager determines that the CORBA connection is unavailable when the persistent CORBA connection is unavailable.","According to another aspect of the present invention, another persistent CORBA connection is established with the enterprise information system when the persistent CORBA connection is unavailable. The connection manager allocates the other persistent CORBA connection to the application component.","According to still another aspect of the present invention, the application server includes a connection manager that receives a message from the enterprise information system indicating that the persistent CORBA connection is not active. The connection manager terminates the persistent CORBA connection in response to receiving the message.","According to yet another aspect of the present invention, the application server includes a connection manager that monitors the persistent CORBA connection to determine whether the persistent CORBA connection is active.","According to another aspect of the present invention, the application server includes a management module that establishes additional CORBA connections with the enterprise information system until a predetermined minimum number of CORBA connections are established. The management module establishing additional CORBA connections with the enterprise information system until a predetermined maximum number of CORBA connections are established. The application server includes a connection manager that receives requests from an application component implemented by the application server to allocate a CORBA connection. The management module establishes CORBA connections after the predetermined minimum number of CORBA connections are established. The CORBA connections established after the predetermined minimum number are established based on a determination that the previously established CORBA connections are unavailable.","A user uses a client device to contact a web application server over the internet. Exemplary client devices include a personal digital assistant (PDA), a personal computer (PC), a laptop computer, or any other type of device that permits access to the internet. Exemplary web application servers include IBM WebSphere or BEA Systems WebLogic.","The web application server is J2EE compliant and implements application components that interact with the user. A detailed description of the various features of J2EE may be found in \u201cJava\u2122 2 Platform Enterprise Edition Specification, v1.3\u201d, in the names of Bill SHANNON et al., released Jul. 27, 2001, the disclosure of which is expressly incorporated herein by reference in its entirety.","An application component implemented by the web application server may process requests from the user. The application component provides a user interface to the user. The user interface enables the user to connect, directly or indirectly, with a CORBA enterprise information system (EIS). The CORBA enterprise information system processes requests that include, for example, CORBA application programming interfaces (APIs) that are used to process objects.","A J2EE compliant connector is provided as a resource adapter to connect the J2EE compliant web application server and the CORBA enterprise information system. A detailed description of the various features of a J2EE connector may be found in \u201cJava\u2122 Enterprise Edition: J2EE\u2122 Connector Architecture Specification v.1.0\u201d, in the names of Rahul SHARMA et al., released Aug. 22, 2001, the disclosure of which is expressly incorporated herein by reference in its entirety. The resource adapter defines a set of scalable, secure and transactional mechanisms to enable the integration of the CORBA enterprise information system with the J2EE compliant web application server.","The resource adapter encapsulates a CORBA interface for the CORBA enterprise information system. The CORBA interface for the CORBA enterprise information system specifies the CORBA application programming interfaces used by the CORBA enterprise information system.","The resource adapter is plugged into the J2EE compliant web application server and enables communication between the J2EE compliant web application server and the CORBA enterprise information system. The resource adapter is standardized for the CORBA enterprise information system so that it can be plugged into any J2EE compliant application server to establish connections with the CORBA enterprise information system.","Accordingly, the user using the internet-enabled client device can obtain the user interface from an application component implemented by the J2EE compliant web application server. The resource adapter enables the application component to connect with the CORBA enterprise information system. The user interface is used to forward CORBA requests from the user to a CORBA enterprise information system. The resource adapter is provided to ensure that the J2EE compliant web application server can forward CORBA requests that can be processed by the CORBA enterprise information system.",{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0044","num":"0043"},"figref":["FIG. 4","FIG. 4"],"b":["480","450","410","450","420","410","450","450","460","480","450","460","460","450","480","480","490"]},"The CORBA enterprise information system  receives a CORBA request from the application server . The CORBA request uses one or more CORBA application programming interfaces to specify operations to perform on an object managed by the CORBA enterprise information system . The specified operations may include, e.g., accessing, deleting, retrieving or moving account information. Of course, the specified operations may be any operation enabled by the provider of the CORBA enterprise information system .","In an embodiment, the CORBA enterprise information system  is a CORBA service manager in a telecommunications system and the enterprise information system archive  is a service control point database in the telecommunications system. A CORBA service manager is, for example, a Lucent enhanced Service Manager (eSM) that manages one or more service control points in the telecommunications system. A service control point database stores service account information for customers of a telecommunications service provider. In the telecommunications system embodiment, the user of the customer device workstation  is a customer of the telecommunications service provider. The customer uses a service independent platform implemented by the application server  to access and change service account information over the internet .","Accordingly, using the J2EE CORBA connector , a legacy CORBA enterprise information system  that processes CORBA requests will allow J2EE compliant application servers  to forward CORBA requests from a user of a customer device workstation . Of course, the present invention is not limited to service managers in a telecommunications environment. Rather, the present invention enables any CORBA enterprise information system to process CORBA requests from J2EE application servers, using a J2EE\u2014CORBA connector.",{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0048","num":"0047"},"figref":["FIG. 1","FIG. 1"],"b":["100","120","150","100","120","100","450","100","120"]},"The application server program  includes a connection manager  that manages unused managed CORBA connections  for the application server program . The unused managed CORBA connections  are pooled in a connection pool . For example, when a user using the application component  requests the services of an external CORBA enterprise information system , the connection manager  determines whether an appropriate managed CORBA connection  to the CORBA enterprise information system  is available in the connection pool .","A resource adapter  is provided as a J2EE\u2014CORBA connector to the CORBA enterprise information system . The resource adapter  is plugged into the J2EE compliant application server  that hosts the application server program . As shown, the resource adapter  encapsulates a CORBA interface . The encapsulated CORBA interface  enables the application component  to forward CORBA requests to the CORBA enterprise information system  via the managed CORBA connection .","The managed CORBA connection  uses the CORBA interface  to ensure that requests to the enterprise information system  are compatible with application programming interfaces (APIs) of the enterprise information system . The requests from the encapsulated CORBA interface  specify operations for the enterprise information system  to perform on objects.","The resource adapter  manages the CORBA connections between the application component  and the CORBA enterprise information system . The resource adapter  is customized for the CORBA enterprise information system .","Additionally, a deployment descriptor module  is provisioned to specify parameters for the deployment of each connection . The deployment descriptor module  may specify which application components  implemented by the application server  are entitled to communicate over a managed connection  to the CORBA enterprise information system . Since the application server program  may implement multiple application components , the deployment descriptor module  may specify the minimum and maximum number of managed CORBA connections  to be established for each application component . Accordingly, each managed CORBA connection  can be customized according to the needs of the J2EE compliant application server . For example, a minimum number and a maximum number of managed CORBA connections may be established and managed by the resource adapter .","In an embodiment, the management module  initiates new managed CORBA connections  when the number of available managed CORBA connections  falls below a threshold. In another embodiment, the connection manager  maintains a minimum number of managed CORBA connections  and a maximum number of managed CORBA connections , based upon parameters stored by the deployment descriptor module . The management module  only exceeds the minimum number of managed CORBA connections  on an as-needed basis. In an embodiment, if a connection request from an application component  cannot be satisfied, the management module  informs the connection manager  that a managed connection  can not be established, and the connection manager  informs the application component  that a managed connection  is unavailable via the connection factory .","The managed CORBA connections  are persistent such that they are maintained even when a particular application component  session ends. Accordingly, a managed CORBA connection  may be used for requests from more than one application component , though the connection may be lost or disconnected, e.g., after a period of inactivity.","The resource adapter  also includes a connection factory . When the application component  needs a managed CORBA connection  to the enterprise information system , the application component  requests the managed CORBA connection  from the connection factory . In turn, the connection factory  delegates the connection request to the connection manager  of the application server program . The connection manager  determines whether a matching managed CORBA connection  is available in a connection pool  provided by the J2EE application server. If a matching managed CORBA connection  is available in the connection pool , then the matching managed CORBA connection  is allocated to the application component .","Each managed CORBA connection  has an application-level handle to reference the underlying physical connection. The application component  contacts the connection factory  to obtain the handle of a managed connection . The application component  may contact the connection factory  to obtain multiple managed connections  using a, e.g., getConnection, method call. As described above, the connection manager  determines whether an appropriate managed CORBA connection  is available from the connection pool . If an appropriate managed CORBA connection  is not available, the management module  establishes an appropriate managed CORBA connection , so long as a new appropriate connection  can be established according to the deployment descriptor . The handle of the new connection  is passed to the application component  via the connection factory .","Once the managed CORBA connection  is established between the CORBA application component  and the CORBA enterprise information system , the CORBA requests are forwarded to the CORBA enterprise information system . The CORBA requests specify operations to perform on an object managed by the service manager. Accordingly, the resource adapter  enables the customer to specify operations for the CORBA enterprise information system  to perform, though the customer is accessing a J2EE compliant web component. Additionally, the resource adapter  establishes, maintains and manages one or more managed CORBA connections  to the enterprise information system  through the CORBA interface .",{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0059","num":"0058"},"figref":"FIG. 2","b":["120","190","205","180","150","450","480"]},"The encapsulated CORBA interface  may specify, for example, the application programming interfaces (APIs) that are used to process objects at the CORBA enterprise information system . The encapsulated CORBA interface  may also translate requests from the application component  to the appropriate CORBA application programming interfaces. For example, the encapsulated CORBA interface  may include a table of CORBA application programming interfaces and the corresponding commands from the application component  that are used to invoke each application programming interface. Because the resource adapter  is typically specific to the enterprise information system , the CORBA interface  is also typically specific to the enterprise information system . Accordingly, the CORBA interface  reflects the specific CORBA application programming interfaces used by the enterprise information system .","At S, the resource adapter  is integrated with the application server program . For example, the relevant parameters of the deployment descriptor module  are set based on the various application components  implemented by the J2EE compliant application server that hosts the application server program . At S, one or more CORBA connections  are established between the application server program  and the enterprise information system . In an embodiment, the management module  initially establishes the minimum number of managed CORBA connections  set by the deployment descriptor module . The managed CORBA connections  are added to the connection pool  of the application server program  and the connection manager  determines that the managed CORBA connection  is available.","At S, a request is received via the application component  to allocate a CORBA connection  for the application component . At S, a determination is made whether a CORBA connection  is available from the connection pool  of the application server program . The determination may be made by a connection manager  for the particular application component  making the request. If a managed CORBA connection  is available (S=Yes), the managed CORBA connection  is allocated to the application component  at S, and the process ends. In particular, the application-level handle of the physical CORBA connection  is passed to the application component . The application component  uses the returned connection handle to access the enterprise information system .","If a CORBA connection  is not available (S=No), a determination is made at S whether a maximum number of CORBA connections  have been established between the application server program  and the enterprise information system . The determination at S may be based on whether a maximum number of CORBA connections  have been established for a particular application component , module or application, by the application server program . The determination is made with reference to parameters provided by the deployment descriptor module . If the maximum number of CORBA connections  have previously been established by the application server program  (S=Yes), the application component  is informed that no CORBA connections  are available at S, and the process ends. If the maximum number of CORBA connections  have not previously been established by the application server program  (S=No), the management module  establishes another managed CORBA connection  at S. The new managed CORBA connection  is then allocated to the application component at S, and the process ends.","Accordingly, the connection manager  determines whether a CORBA connection  is available from the connection pool at S. Additionally, when no CORBA connection  is available from the connection pool at S (S=No), the management module  creates a new physical CORBA connection  to the enterprise information system  at S, so long as the maximum number of CORBA connections  to the enterprise information system  have not already been established (S=No).",{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0065","num":"0064"},"figref":"FIG. 3","b":["165","450","190","305","155","120","155","165","315","165","100","165","120","100","320","165","100","165","120","100"]},"At S, an initial managed CORBA connection  is specified. At S, the physical connection handle of the initial managed CORBA connection  is designated. At S, a determination is made whether the initial managed CORBA connection  is a shared managed CORBA connection . A shared managed CORBA connection  is shared by multiple application components , modules or applications implemented by the application server program .","If the initial CORBA connection  is not a shared managed CORBA connection  (S=No), the application component , module or application that is eligible to use the initial managed CORBA connection  is designated at S. If the initial CORBA connection  is a shared managed CORBA connection  (S=Yes), the application components , modules or applications that are eligible to share the initial managed CORBA connection  are designated at S.","At S, a determination is made whether additional managed CORBA connections  are to be established. If an additional managed CORBA connection  is to be established (S=Yes), the next managed CORBA connection  is specified at S, the handle of the next managed CORBA connection  is designated at S, and the process from S to S repeats. The process from S or S to S ends when no additional connections  are to be established (S=No). Accordingly, the resource adapter  is customized by the minimum and maximum number of connections, by whether any particular managed CORBA connections  are to be shared, and by the application components , modules and applications that can use a particular managed CORBA connection .","Although the invention has been described with reference to several exemplary embodiments, it is understood that the words that have been used are words of description and illustration, rather than words of limitation.
