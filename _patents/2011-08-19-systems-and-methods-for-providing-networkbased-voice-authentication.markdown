No. 10\/900,335, filed Jul. 28, 2004, the disclosure of which is incorporated by reference herein in its entirety.","The present invention relates generally to speech verification systems and, more particularly, to systems and methods for implementing speech verification systems.","Speaker verification is the process of verifying the identity of a speaker based upon an analysis of a sample of his or her speech using previously saved information. In general, speaker verification or authentication consists of making a determination as to whether the identity of a speaker is, in fact, the same as that being claimed. Some applications of speaker verification include, for example, access control for a variety of purposes, such as for telephones, computer networks, databases, bank accounts, credit-card funds, automatic teller machines, building or office entry, etc. Providing automatic verification of a person's identity based upon his or her voice can be implemented more conveniently and in a less costly manner than many other known biometric methods such as, fingerprint analysis or retinal\/iris scanning. Further, unlike other biometric solutions, speaker verification is non-intrusive and may be implemented from a remote location. In addition to added convenience, speaker verification of user identity substantially increases security of phone-based communication systems over conventional authentication systems such as those using numeric PIN codes or passwords.","In general, speaker verification is performed based upon previously saved information which, at least in part, represents particular vocal characteristics of the speaker whose identity is to be verified. Specifically, the speech signal which results from a speaker's \u201ctest\u201d utterance (i.e., an utterance offered for the purpose of verifying the speaker's identity) is analyzed to extract certain acoustic elements of the speech signal commonly referred to as a voice print. The previously uttered speech which is used for comparison purposes most commonly, but not necessarily, consists of a number of repetitions of the same word or phrase as the one which is to be spoken as the \u201ctest\u201d utterance. In any case, the previously uttered speech is referred to as \u201ctraining\u201d speech, and it is provided to the system as part of an \u201cenrollment\u201d session.","In use, identified acoustic elements extracted a user's input voice signal are compared against the voice print identified from the test utterance. A determination is then made indicating whether the speaker is who they claim to be.","Unfortunately, speaker verification systems proposed to date require significant capital and infrastructure expense on the part of the entity desiring system implementation. In addition to procuring or developing software systems for establishing and comparing voice print data from enrolled participants, the voice prints generated during enrollment of users must be maintained in manner facilitating efficient utilization. Such limitations render speaker verification systems unusable to a wide-variety of otherwise interested entities.","Accordingly, there is a need in the art of speaker verification systems for a speaker verification system which reduces expense and infrastructure requirements for participating entities.","In accordance with one implementation consistent with the principles of the invention, a system provides voice authentication via a network. The system may include an intelligent voice response engine that may be operatively coupled to the network for receiving transaction or access requests from the plurality of telecommunications devices over the network. A speech recognition and verification services engine may be operatively coupled to the network. A database may be operatively coupled to the speech recognition and verification services engine for storing user voice print profiles. The speech recognition and verification services engine may receive a speaker verification call from the intelligent voice response engine, perform speaker verification on the received speaker verification call based on the stored user voice print profiles, and generate a verification score based upon results of the speaker verification.","In another implementation consistent with the principles of the invention, a system performs speaker verification. The system may include a speech recognition and verification services engine that may be operatively coupled to a first network. A database may be operatively coupled to the speech recognition and verification services engine for storing user voice print profiles. The speech recognition and verification services engine may be configured to: receive a speaker verification call from a voice response engine over the first network; receive an authentication security level associated with the speaker verification call from the voice response engine; perform speaker verification on the received speaker verification call based on the stored user voice print profiles and the authentication security level associated with the speaker verification call; and generate a verification score based upon results of the speaker verification.","In yet another implementation consistent with principles of the invention, there is provided a method for performing speaker recognition over a network. The method may include receiving a call including a transaction or access request from one of a plurality of telecommunications devices over the network. The call may be passed to a speech recognition and verification services engine over the network. The call may be received by the speech recognition and verification services engine. Speaker verification may be performed on the received call based on user voice print profiles. A verification score may be generated based upon results of the speaker verification.","In still another implementation consistent with principles of the invention, there is provided a method for performing speaker verification. The method may include receiving a call from a voice response system over a first network. An authentication security level associated with the call may be received from the voice response system. Speaker verification may be performed on the received call based on stored user voice print profiles and the authentication security level. A verification score may be generated based upon results of the speaker verification.","In another implementation consistent with principles of the invention, a computer-readable medium is provided that contains instructions for performing a method for providing speaker verification over a network. The method may include receiving a call from a first system via the network. Speaker verification may be performed on the received call based on user voice print profiles. A verification score may be generated based upon results of the speaker verification. The verification score may be passed to the first system for access determination.","Other features and advantages of the present invention will become readily apparent to those skilled in this art from the following detailed description. The embodiments shown and described provide illustration of the best mode contemplated for carrying out the invention. The invention is capable of modifications in various obvious respects, all without departing from the invention. Accordingly, the drawings are to be regarded as illustrative in nature, and not as restrictive.","The following detailed description of implementations consistent with the present invention refers to the accompanying drawings. The same reference numbers in different drawings may identify the same or similar elements. Also, the following detailed description does not limit the invention. Instead, the scope of the invention is defined by the appended claims and equivalents.","Systems and methods consistent with the present invention provide network-based speaker verification. According to one implementation consistent with principles of the invention, an intelligent voice response engine receives users calls and passes them to a third party speech recognition and verification services engine for speaker recognition based on stored user voice profiles. The speech recognition and verification services engine generates a verification score.",{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0026","num":"0025"},"figref":"FIG. 1","b":["100","100","110","120","130","140","150"]},"Network  may include any combination of known network portions, including, but not limited to: a wireline telecommunications network (i.e., the Public Switched Telephone Network or PSTN), one or several wireless telecommunications networks operating with know protocols, e.g., Time Division Multiple Access (TDMA), Code Division Multiple Access (CDMA), Global System for Mobile Communications (GSM), Multi-Point Microwave Distribution System (MMDS), etc., and may also comprise an Internet Protocol (IP)-based packet-switched network (PSN) portion for providing Voice over IP (VoIP) telephony., e.g., an H.323 network or a Session Initiation Protocol (SIP) network, or the Internet. Those skilled in the art should further appreciate that network  is illustrative and inclusive of any proprietary or customized operator networks used for data transport, e.g., Local Area Networks (LANs), Wide Area Networks (WANs), Metropolitan Area Networks (MANs), Personal Area Networks (PANs), Ethernet portions, Token Ring portions, etc., which interconnect various nodes and equipment used for effectuating the invention.","Additionally, telecommunications devices  may include, but are not limited to, POTS (Plain Old Telephone Service) wireline telephones, wireless network telephones (e.g., CDMA, TDMA, GSM, etc.), Internet telephones, SIP phones, H.323 terminals, Information Appliances, mobile stations, personal computers including Telephony Application Programming Interfaces (TAPIs), etc.","In an exemplary implementation, IVR engine  is associated with an enterprise caller third party not otherwise affiliated with the SRVS engine , each of which is operatively connected to each other and with the plurality of telecommunications devices  by network . In one embodiment, the enterprise caller third party may be a bank or other financial institution. However, it should be understood that any suitable enterprise requiring voice authentication of callers may be associated with IVR engine . As will be discussed in additional detail below, in one implementation consistent with principles of the invention, the enterprise caller third party wishes to authenticate callers into their existing IVR applications with multiple different security levels (e.g., low, medium, and high). Additionally, in one implementation, SRVS engine  provides speaker verification services in response to requests from IVR engine . Such services may be performed in any suitable manner using the voice profiles stored in database . Furthermore, it should be understood that, although  illustrates a single IVR engine  and SRVS engine  connected by network , in alternate implementations, these devices may be directly connected or may comprise a single device\/system.",{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0030","num":"0029"},"figref":"FIG. 2","b":["100","200","140","202"]},"Next, assume IVR engine  receives a call from a user to perform a desired transaction (e.g., financial transfer, information retrieval, etc.) over network  (act ). In response to user inputs (e.g., voice responses, DTMF (dual tone multifrequency) tones, etc.) into IVR engine , an authentication security level is determined for the desired transaction (act ). For example, in a financial setting, if a user wishes to transfer money from one account to another, a higher security level may be required than if the user simply wants to review current balance or payment information. In one embodiment, IVR engine  and SRVS engine  together support three distinct security levels, although any suitable number of security levels may be embodied in the present invention.","In accordance with one implementation consistent with principles of the invention, SRVS engine  supports three distinct incoming call numbers associated with the third Party's three security levels. Accordingly, IVR engine  calls SRVS engine  at a number associated with the authentication security level identified in act  (act ). Alternatively, one number may be used and IVR engine  may transmit a security level indicator with the call. Upon connection, IVR engine  passes the user call through to SRVS engine  for speaker verification (act ). In one implementation consistent with principles of the invention, the IVR engine  remains in the call path so as to be responsive to DTMF tones generated by the SRVS engine  upon completion of the speaker verification process.","SRVS engine  then performs speaker verification of the caller at a level commensurate with the previously identified authentication security level (act ). In one implementation this may include querying the caller to answer questions corresponding to the questions asked during voice print profile creation. Alternatively, the caller may be asked to repeat requested phrases. It should be understood that the specific manner of speaker verification or authentication may incorporate any known verification techniques, such as passcode or password repetition, random utterances, etc.","Once SRVS engine  has performed its verification, it calculates or otherwise generates a verification score or other type of verification result relating to the certainty or probability that the caller is as asserted (act ). Next, the verification score is passed to IVR engine  for use in determining access for the desired action (act ). In one embodiment consistent with principles of the invention, the verification score is passed from SRVS engine  to IVR engine  via the previously established call path by DTMF tones. For example, simple combinations of DTMF tones representative of the SRVS engine's verification certainty (e.g., tones \u201c00\u201d to \u201c99\u201d) may be passed as a verification score in act .","Once the verification score has been passed from SRVS engine  to IVR engine , IVR engine  determines whether the received score meets or exceeds a predetermined value associated with the desired transaction or identified authentication level (act ). If not, the caller is notified that voice verification has failed (act ). In one implementation consistent with principles of the invention, the caller is returned to an initial menu of options initially available upon call receipt by IVR engine . If the received verification score does meet or exceed a predetermined value associated with the desired transaction or identified authentication level, IVR engine  continues with the requested transaction in any suitable manner (act ).",{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0036","num":"0035"},"figref":"FIG. 3","b":["120","300","120","302","120","130","304","120","130","306","308"]},"Once the verification score has been determined, it is converted to a percentage corresponding to an in-band DTMF return code relating to the determined level of authentication. In the present example, assume that the caller's verification score has been determined to be 78. Accordingly, SRVS generates a DTMF \u201c78\u201d return code for receipt by IVR engine  (act ). Next, IVR engine  resumes call control and determines whether the received score is sufficient to enable the requested transfer (act ). If so, IVR engine proceeds to process the requested transfer (act ). However, if the received verification score is not sufficient to enable immediate processing of the requested transaction, the caller may be transferred to a live agent for further security verification or the funds transfer may be simply denied (act ).","Referring now to , there is shown an exemplary flow diagram, consistent with the present invention, illustrating one example of a method for enhancing security between IVR engine  and SRVS engine . In accordance with this implementation, special information may be exchanged between IVR engine  and SRVS engine  prior to the IVR engine's connecting (cutting thru) the caller's voice path to the SRVS engine . More particularly, SRVS engine  initially answers a call from IVR engine  (prior to cut thru of voice path) (act  of ). At this point, IVR engine  may transmit a DTMF security sequence to SRVS engine  (act ). In response, SRVS engine transmits the received DTMF sequence in reverse back to IVR engine  (act ). The voice path may then be connected (act  of ) and the call proceeds as described above in .",{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0039","num":"0038"},"figref":"FIG. 5","b":["500","500","110","120","130","140","150","510"]},"As described above, network , as well as newly described network , may include any combination of known network portions. Additionally, it should be understood that, although networks  and  are illustrated as separate networks, these networks may be implemented as a single network in which different network connections or connection types may be implemented so as to enable parallel communications channels to be established.","In the present implementation, IVR engine  is again associated with an enterprise caller third party not otherwise affiliated with SRVS engine  as described in . Each of the IVR engine  and SRVS engine  are operatively connected to each other and with the plurality of telecommunications devices  by first network  and second network . The connection between IVR engine  and SRVS engine  via network  may represent an out of band interface with respect to a connection between IVR engine  telecommunications device  and SRVS engine  via network . As with the embodiments described above, assume that the enterprise caller third party wishes to authenticate callers into their existing IVR applications with multiple different security levels (e.g., low, medium, and high).",{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0042","num":"0041"},"figref":"FIG. 6","b":["500","600","140","602"]},"Next, IVR engine  receives a call from a user to perform a desired transaction (e.g., financial transfer, information retrieval, etc.) over network  (act ).

In one embodiment, IVR engine  and SRVS engine  together support three distinct security levels, although any suitable number of security levels may be embodied in the present invention.","In accordance with one implementation consistent with principles of the invention, SRVS engine  supports a single generic call number associated with IVR engine  requests. Accordingly, IVR engine  next calls SRVS engine  at its generic call number (act ). Upon connection, IVR engine  passes the user call and a Call Indicator Key through to SRVS engine  for speaker verification (act ). As will be described below, the Call Indicator Key enables SRVS engine  to associate the passed voice call with additional context information received via out of band network . In one implementation consistent with principles of the invention, the Call Indicator Key may include PSTN signaling. For example, the last four digits of the call ANI (automatic number identification) may be transmitted via PSTN signaling. As the voice call is being passed to SRVS engine  (act ), IVR engine  also transmits the Call Indicator Key and an authentication level associated with the call to SRVS engine  using out of band network  (act ). In one implementation consistent with principles of the invention, out of band network  is a packet-based network that supports the secure hypertext transfer protocol (HTTPS).","SRVS engine  then matches the out of band authentication level information received in act  with the voice call received in act  using the Call Indicator Key (act ). SRVS engine next performs speaker verification of the caller at a level commensurate with the received authentication level (act ). In one implementation, this may include querying the caller to answer questions corresponding to the questions asked during voice print profile creation. Once SRVS engine  has performed its verification, it calculates or otherwise generates a verification score or other type of verification result relating to the certainty or probability that the caller is as asserted (act ). Next, SRVS engine  passes the voice call back to IVR engine  (act ) and transmits the Call Indicator Key and verification score to IVR engine  via the out of band network  (act ).","Once the verification score has been passed from SRVS engine  to IVR engine , IVR engine  matches the received score with the voice call using the Call Indicator Key (act ). Next, IVR engine  determines whether the received score meets or exceeds a predetermined value associated with the desired transaction or identified authentication level (act ). If not, the caller is notified that voice verification has failed (act ) and\/or the caller is queried regarding further authentication procedures (i.e., human interaction). If the received verification score does meet or exceed a predetermined value associated with the desired transaction or identified authentication level, IVR engine  continues with the requested transaction in any suitable manner (act ).",{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0047","num":"0046"},"figref":"FIG. 7","b":["700","700","110","120","130","140","150"]},"In accordance with the present implementation, network  may include any Internet Protocol (IP)-based packet-switched network (PSN) portion for providing Voice over IP (VoIP) telephony., e.g., an H.323 network or a Session Initiation Protocol (SIP) network, or the Internet.
