{"@attributes":{"id":"description"},"RELAPP":[{},{}],"heading":["CROSS-REFERENCE TO RELATED APPLICATION","STATEMENT OF GOVERNMENT INTEREST","BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION","SUMMARY OF THE INVENTION","DETAILED DESCRIPTION OF THE INVENTION"],"p":["This application claims priority from U.S. Provisional Patent Application No. 61\/191,529 filed Sep. 2, 2008, for a Hydrophone Signal Junction Board, the disclosure of which is incorporated herein by reference in its entirety.","The invention described herein may be manufactured and used by or for the Government of the United States of America for governmental purposes without the payment of any royalties thereon or therefor.","1. Field of the Invention","The invention relates to electrical systems and devices. More particularly, the invention relates to a matrix board with a panel having a planar surface for supporting a first circuit and a parallel surface for supporting a second circuit and pins for making connections between circuits. Most particularly the invention relates to an assembly of matrix board modules and I\/O board modules adapted for connection of a hydrophone cable and an accelerometer cable.","2. Discussion of the Related Art","In an acoustic test facility, analog sensor signals are routed to data acquisition channels for analysis. Although data acquisition is conceptually simple, test facilities may have a large number of sensors and a large number of acquisition channels to connect. Connecting specific sensors to specific acquisition channels and checking all newly made circuits takes considerable effort. A change in test series requires reconfiguring the sensors and data acquisition channels and introduces the potential for error due to misrouting.","A cable patch panel is the primary apparatus used for reconfigurable test systems. A cable patch panel provides for routing all sensor cable to an input junction box panel and all data acquisition cables to an output junction box panel. Jumper cables make the connection to patch signals between the input junction box panel and the output junction box panel. This allows any sensor to be routed to any data acquisition channel by way of the jumper cables. While this apparatus is adequate when there are only a few sensors and channels, when the number of sensors and channels becomes large, the system becomes cumbersome. For example, in order to reroute a single connection, it may be necessary to disconnect a number of jumpers to access a desired cable. This introduces the potential for introducing errors when reattaching jumper cables. In addition, the size and weight of a large patch panel can make a system impractical for tests involving large numbers of sensors and channels.","Mechanical relay matrix boards are also used for signal routing. Relay boards connect an input to an output through a relay. However relays have limitations. Commercially available relay matrix boards have a limited number of channels. Typically, relays used for this purpose provide for 24 inputs and 24 outputs. Multiple relays can be used, but this increases cost and degrades signal quality.","Integrated circuits with solid state relays are also used for switching signals. Solid state relays are more compact than mechanical relays. However, solid state relays are active electronic devices that introduce small loads in signal lines. The sum of small loads becomes significant in large channel systems resulting in amounts of signal distortion and loss. Amplifiers have been added to solid state matrix boards to make up these losses. However, this introduces signal directionality problems. In addition, most solid state relays are able to pass only low differential signals. They cannot be used for ICP(IEPE-type) device signals, i.e. signals from Integrated Circuit Piezoelectric (Integrated Electronics Piezo Electric) devices. ICP(IEPE-type) devices have transducers to measure parameters such as dynamic pressure, force strain and acceleration. ICP(IEPE-type) devices include hydrophones and accelerometers.","There is a need in the art for improvements in junction boards to accommodate hydrophone and accelerometers cables.","An assembly of connected circuit boards includes at least one each of a matrix board, an input board and an output board.","(a.) The matrix board comprises:\n\n","(b.) the input board includes at least one differential signal sensor cable connector.\n\n","(c.) The output board includes a connector having pin contacts for connection with circuit lines on the output circuit support layer on the matrix board.","The matrix board, input board and output board are each modular and can be assembled with the addition of like modules to accommodate large numbers of sensors and channels.","The assembly of printed circuit boards is configured to allow connection of a large number of analog sensors to data acquisition channels. Both high and low differential signal sensors are accommodated. The assembly can be laid out to allow easy reconfiguration and checking of the signal path where there are a large number of input signals and a large number of signal destinations.","The matrix board comprises a plurality of superposed circuit support layers. There is at least one input circuit support layer and at least one output circuit support layer. Each circuit support layer has circuit lines on one face. These circuit lines can be etched, printed or may be wires or equivalents known in the art for carrying an electronic signal. The circuit support layers are held in superposed relation so that all parts on the layers in the plurality are geometrically aligned and spaced. The generally straight circuit lines on the input circuit support layer are perpendicular, i.e. orthogonal, to the functionally straight circuit lines on the output circuit support layer. Multiple conductive pins are attached to each circuit line. Each pin extends to a superposed panel to permit connective access to the pin end. Each pin is insulated from all circuit lines other than the circuit line to which it is attached. The pins are laid out in an orderly array so that the pin end can be attached with a jumper to another pin end. The jumper carries the signal from the pin and attached circuit line to another pin and attached circuit line. As a result, signals are selectively conducted from circuit lines on the input conductive layer to circuit lines on the output conductive layer.","The arrangement of the input board, matrix board and output board allows any input signal or pair of differential input signals to be quickly associated with any output conductor or multiple output conductors. The assembly is initially arranged by: (i.) connecting the input signal to an input board pin contact, (ii.) connecting the input board pin contact with a pin attached to a circuit line on the input circuit support layer, (iii.) connecting a pin associated with the circuit line on the input circuit support layer with a pin associated with a circuit line on the output circuit support layer, (iv.) connecting a pin associated with the output circuit line with a pin on the output board and (v.) connecting a pin on the output board to the desired channel. Connections are made with jumpers.","After the initial connections are established, reconfiguring the input signals with different output channels is accomplished by changing the jumper connectors on the matrix board panel. Pairs of differential input signals are realigned with pairs of jumpers. Multiple pins are provided for each circuit line. This allows all connections to be made with short, easy to manipulate jumpers. Typically the center-to-center distance between paired pins on the pin connection panel is about 0.1 inch.","The utility of the assembly of circuit boards is most apparent where there are a large numbers of sensor input signals and large numbers of output channel destinations. Large numbers of circuits are accommodated by making the matrix board panels modular. A single matrix board panel can accommodate 48 input signal pairs and 48 output signal pairs. However, multiple matrix board modules can be connected together. An array of 240 input signal pairs and 48 output signal pairs is contemplated. An array of 144 input signal pairs and 144 output signal pairs is contemplated. Any combination based on multiples of 48 pairs of conductive lines per circuit board is possible.","Another advantage of the invention is the input and output (I\/O) boards. The input board is in signal communication with a circuit line on an input circuit support layer and the output board is in signal communication with a circuit line on the output circuit support layer. There are two distinct types of input boards for accommodating high and low differential signal cables.","A hydrophone cable is a high differential signal cable. Hydrophone cable input boards have six wire connections per channel. Three of the connections support the signal from the sensor. These are the higher and lower differential signal wires and the shield. The other three wires support the sensor with a calibration signal, electric power and ground. The hydrophone input board connects with each of the six wires. The higher and lower differential signals are carried through the matrix board to the output board. The ground wire is connected to a common ground on a dedicated circuit support layer on the matrix board and the output board. The lower differential signal may optionally be connected to ground at the output board. The hydrophone is powered at the input board by connection to a power supply. A switch is provided for connection to a +24 vdc (direct current volts) source, a +18 vdc (direct current volts) source or to ground (Com). A calibration signal is also provided to the hydrophone by connection at the input board to a calibration signal generator. The hydrophone cable ground is grounded at the input board. Connections are made with jumpers. Likewise, switching is accomplished with jumpers.","A single-ended (SE) cable is a low differential signal cable. Single-ended (SE) cable input boards have three connections per channel. These connections are for the higher and lower differential signals and the shield. The higher and lower differential signals are carried through the matrix board to the output board. The lower differential signal may optionally be connected to ground at the input board or at the output board.","The invention is described with reference to the drawing. The drawing discloses a preferred embodiment of the invention and is not intended to limit the generally broad scope of the invention as set forth in the claims. The drawing is schematic and is not drawn to scale.","In , the assembly of connected circuit boards includes at least one each of an input board , a matrix board , and an output board .
