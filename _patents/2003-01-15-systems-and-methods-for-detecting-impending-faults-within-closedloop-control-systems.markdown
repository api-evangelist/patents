title: Systems and methods for detecting impending faults within closed-loop control systems
abstract: An impending fault of a component operated within a closed-loop control system can be detected. The close-loop control system is disabled. An actuator of the closed-loop control system is operated at one or more test values. A sensor reading of the actuator is taken while that actuator is operated at the one or more test values. A warning is generated if an impending fault condition is detected. An impending fault condition may be detected if the component operates at a value exceeding a maximum defined operating value, if the component operates at a value below a minimum defined operating value, or if an operating range that is narrower than a defined full operating range for the component is detected.

Field of Invention","This invention generally relates to systems and methods for detecting impending faults within closed-loop control systems.","2. Description of Related Art","To achieve consistent operational quality, complex electromechanical systems generally use closed-loop process controls. In an exemplary closed-loop control system, an actuator influences the operation of a component so that the amplitude of an error signal, generated in response to deviations by the actuator from a defined normal condition, is minimized.","Operational quality is defined by the operating space of the system. An operating space is the range of sensor readings around a target value in which nominal operating conditions are maintained.","Changes in the process dynamics, such as environmental changes or aging of the components, may warrant changes in the targets for maintaining the same consistent performance. As a result, the operating space also changes. The process is under control only so long as the targets and the actuators are within the operating space defined by the respective allowable range of variation around their nominal values. This process continues until the system cannot operate within the operating space and a fault is declared.","As outlined above, in a closed loop system, a fault is generated only after a system is no longer operating within its operating space. As a result, fault prediction is difficult in a closed-loop system because operation of an actuator is automatically adjusted so that the process remains under control. Therefore, a fault is declared only after it occurs. However, when the fault is declared only after it occurs, it is too late to prevent a service call. As a result, machine down time due to the fault, may, and probably will, occur. Thus, expensive machine down-time could be avoided if an impending fault could be anticipated, even under closed loop control, before it occurs.","This invention provides systems and methods that allow impending faults to be detected.","This invention separately provides systems and methods that allow impending faults within a closed-loop control system to be detected.","This invention separately provides systems and methods that operate one or more actuators at various test values and monitor one or more components whose operation is influenced by the operation of the one or more actuators.","This invention separately provides systems and method that generate a warning for an impending fault by periodically monitoring the behavior of one or more actuators and the corresponding targets with respect to the corresponding operating spaces.","This invention separately provides systems and methods for detecting an impending fault of a component that operates within a closed-loop control system.","In various exemplary embodiments of the systems and methods according to this invention, the closed-loop control system is disabled. An actuator influencing the operation of the component is then operated at one or more test values. One or more sensor readings for the component are taken while the actuator is operated at the one or more test values. A warning is generated if an impending fault condition is detected. An impending fault condition may be detected if the component operates at a value exceeding a maximum defined operating value, if the component operates at a value below a minimum defined operating value, or if an operating range that is narrower than a defined full operating range for the component is detected.","The various exemplary embodiments of the systems and methods of this invention detect an impending fault of a component of a system under closed-loop control. In various exemplary embodiments of the invention, the behavior of a target and an actuator with respect to the operating space are periodically monitored. In various exemplary embodiments of the invention, an actuator is operated at one or more test values to determine the operational state of a component. In various exemplary embodiments of this invention, an impending fault condition is detected if a component operates at a level above a defined maximum operating value, if the component operates at a level below a minimum defined operating value, and\/or if a range of operating values for the component that is narrower than a defined full operating range is detected. In any of the foregoing situations, a warning may be generated.",{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0022","num":"0021"},"figref":["FIG. 1","FIG. 1"],"b":["100","100","110","120","130","140","150","160","110","100","110","150"],"sub":"t "},"The actuator  may be any component operated within a closed-loop control system. In various exemplary embodiments, the actuator may be electrical, mechanical, pneumatic or hydraulic in operation.","The error signal generator  inputs the target value  (i.e., the desired value V) and a feedback or sensor signal Vfrom the sensor  and generates an error signal V. The error signal Vis input into the compensator . The error signal Vis produced by comparing the feedback or sensor signal Vto the target value .","The compensator  inputs the error signal Vand outputs an adjusted error signal, or comparator signal V, that is usable to control the operation of one or more components in the plant , such as a power supply. In various exemplary embodiments, the plant  is an electromechanical device, such as a xerographic copier. The plant  produces an output driving signal Vthat is usable to drive or operate the actuator . As the actuator  is driven or actuated by the driving signal V, the value of at least one parameter of the actuator  is read by the sensor . The sensor  is any sensor that can be used to measure a particular parameter of interest of the actuator .","The sensor  converts the sensed parameter into the sensor signal V. In particular, based on the transfer function implemented in the sensor , an amplitude, a frequency, a value of an effort or flow variable, and\/or a value of a power variable of the sensor signal will vary based on the sensed value of the sensed parameter. For example, when the sensor  outputs an electrical signal in response to the sensed parameter of the actuator , the value of the voltage, the current, the frequency, the phase and\/or the wattage of the sensor signal can vary in response to the value of the sensed parameter.","In various exemplary embodiments, the error signal generator  may be a simple on-off control system. In this embodiment, when the sensor  detects operation of the value of the actuator  below the target value V, the actuator  is operated by the error signal Vuntil the detected parameter increases above the target value V. At this time, operation of the actuator  terminates. In various exemplary embodiments, the turn-on and turn-off values for the actuator  differ by a small amount, the hysteresis, to prevent noise from switching the actuator  rapidly and unnecessarily when the detected parameter is near the target value V.","In various exemplary embodiments, the error signal generator  may exert proportional control over the actuator  by applying a driving signal Vto the actuator  in proportion to the difference between the sensor signal Vand the target value V:\n\n(),\u2003\u2003(1)\n\nwhere P is the proportional gain of the compensator .\n","In various exemplary embodiments, the error signal generator  may control the actuator  utilizing proportional-differential PD control. In these exemplary embodiments, a term proportional to the time-derivative of the error signal is added to the control equation. That is, the value of the error signal Vis determined as: \n\n\nwhere D is a damping constant.\n","The value of the damping constant, D, can be adjusted to achieve a critically-damped response to changes in the target value V. In a critically-damped system, a positive initial displacement decays to a negligible level after about one normal period, T.","In various exemplary embodiments, the error signal generator  may utilize a proportional-integral-differential (PID) control. That is, the value of the error signal Vis determined as: \n\n\nwhere I is the integral gain parameter.\n","The integral gain parameter I, serves to change the signal until the time-averaged value of the signal error is 0. A proportional-integral-differential controller is useful to reduce steady-date error in the controller response. It should be appreciated that any known or later-developed closed-loop control system may be used to control the actuator operation.",{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0033","num":"0032"},"figref":["FIG. 2","FIG. 1","FIG. 2"],"b":["200","100","200","220","210","220","110","270","200","212","216","222","226","150"],"sub":["t","a","t ","a "]},"The relationship between the target value V and the values of the driving signal Vis defined by a function . A linear function is illustrated in .","It should be appreciated that any desired function can be used. In various exemplary embodiments of the invention, the function  is generally monotonic. An initial setting  is defined by a nominal actuator value  and a nominal target value .","In systems where an actuator  has a static target value V, the lower and upper target values  and  are equivalent to the nominal target value. In systems where the target value V can itself change over time, the lower and upper target values  and  are generally defined by physical parameters that ensure that the apparatus on which the control system  resides will not damage itself and\/or by the effects the target value  may have on upstream and\/or downstream actuators.","Similarly, the lower and upper actuator values  and  are generally defined by physical parameters that ensure that the operation of an actuator relative to one or more target values V does not damage the apparatus on which the control system  resides.","When either the target value V and\/or the value of the driving signal Vextends outside of the operating space , a fault occurs. The target value V may move to a point outside of the operating space  due to aging of and\/or a failure in a device, structure or apparatus of the apparatus in which the control system  resides that is used to set the target value Vt  for the actuator . The value of the driving signal Vmay move to a point outside of the operating space  due to aging of and\/or a failure in the actuator . For example, if the actuator  is a drive roller, and the value of the driving signal Vis drive motor rotational speed, a fault in a bearing of the drive roller may make the drive roller harder to drive. If the sensed value is the rotational speed of the drive roller, the error signal value Vwill represent the difference in the desired or target and actual rotational speeds. The value of the driving signal Vwill then increase to drive the drive roller harder in an attempt to increase its rotational speed. However, if the value of the driving signal Vexceeds an upper bound that represents the safe drive current that can be output by a drive circuit to or the drive current that can safely be input to the drive motor, a fault has occurred.",{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0039","num":"0038"},"figref":["FIG. 3","FIG. 3"],"b":["100","110","120","100","130","140"]},"In step S, the selected actuator is operated at the selected test value.

If so, operation continues to step S. Otherwise, operation jumps back to step S. In step S, a warning is generated if the determined target values indicate the existence of an impending fault. In various exemplary embodiments, a fault condition exists if any target value falls outside the operating space. In various other exemplary embodiments, a fault condition exists if one or more target values indicate an operating range narrower than in a defined full operating range for the component. Operation then continues to step S, where operation of the method ends.","It should be appreciated that in various exemplary embodiments of the invention, multiple sensors may be selected to monitor multiple parameters of the selected actuator. In various exemplary embodiments of the invention, the selected actuator may be tested in two or more dimensions of operation. Additionally, in various exemplary embodiments of the invention, the interaction of two or more actuators may be tested in one or more operating spaces.",{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0043","num":"0042"},"figref":["FIG. 4","FIG. 4"],"b":["240","110","230","214","244"],"sub":["t ","a"]},"In , an impending fault condition is indicated by the dynamics of the time series of operating points \u2013 shown with a revised function  defining a process shift.","As the closed-loop system degrades, the revised function  defines a new relationship between the target values V and the values of the driving signal V. A new nominal setting  is defined by a new nominal value of the driving signal V, and a new nominal target value .","The function  also defines n operating values, S, S, . . . , S.

The alterable memory, whether volatile or non-volatile, can be implemented using any one or more of static or dynamic RAM, a floppy disk and disk drive, a writeable or rewriteable optical disk and disk drive, a hard drive, flash memory or the like. Similarly, the non-alterable or fixed memory can be implemented using any one or more of ROM, PROM, EPROM, EEPROM, an optical ROM disk, such as CD-ROM or DVD-ROM disk, and disk drive or the like.","It should be understood that each of the circuit, routine or applications shown in  can be implemented as physically distinct hardware circuits within an ASIC, or using an FPGA, a PDL, a PLA or a PAL, a digital signal processor, or using discrete logic elements or discrete circuit elements. The particular form each of the circuits or routines shown in  will take is a design choice and will be obvious and predictable to those skilled in the art.","By means of an example for the various exemplary embodiments of this invention, in xerographic controls, it is necessary to charge a photoreceptor so that the photoreceptor will attract toner particles. The optimum charge for the photoreceptor is, for example, 250 volts. However, the charging process for the photoreceptor is defined as nominal if the photoreceptor is charged as low as 200 volts or as high as 300 volts. A charge below 200 volts or above 300 volts indicates, for example, that the process is broken.","The photoreceptor receives its charge from a grid voltage on a power supply. For example, the power supply has a voltage range between 500 volts and 1000 volts. Thus, a fault may be declared if, in the process of attempting to charge the photoreceptor to 250 volts, the power supply falls below 500 volts or rises above 1000 volts. A fault may be declared because these values are outside of the range of the power supply. A method for the identification of faults in xerographic controls is disclosed in U.S. Pat. No. 5,903,796, assigned to the same assignee as the present invention, incorporated herein.","An impending fault may be detected if the photoreceptor and power supply are charging within their respective voltage ranges, but one or both systems are operating close to their operating space boundaries. Thus, if the photoreceptor is properly charged to 200 volts, but the power supply is charged at 900 volts, then both systems are operating normally. However, an impending fault condition may exist.","In accordance with various exemplary embodiments of this invention, an impending fault condition is detected by first running the power supply from 500 volts to 1000 volts in a series of test values. Next, sensor readings are taken at each test value. The sensor readings are indicative of a photoreceptor charge. If, for example, a power supply is run at between 500 volts to 1000 volts, and the photoreceptor correspondingly charges at between 200 volts and 300 volts, then an impending fault condition is not indicated because both systems cover the full range of values. However, if either system cannot cover an entire range of values, then an impending fault may be indicated with respect to this system.","While this invention has been described in conjunction with the exemplary embodiments outlined above, it is evidenced that many alternatives, modifications and variations will be apparent to those skilled in the art. Accordingly, the exemplary embodiments of the invention, as set forth above, are intended to be illustrative, not limiting. Various changes may be made without departing from the spirit and scope of the invention."],"brief-description-of-drawings":[{},{}],"description-of-drawings":{"heading":"BRIEF DESCRIPTION OF THE DRAWINGS","p":["Various exemplary embodiments of this invention will be described in detail, with reference to the following figures, wherein:",{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0016","num":"0015"},"figref":"FIG. 1"},{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0017","num":"0016"},"figref":"FIG. 2"},{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0018","num":"0017"},"figref":"FIG. 3"},{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0019","num":"0018"},"figref":"FIG. 4"},{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0020","num":"0019"},"figref":"FIG. 5"}]},"DETDESC":[{},{}]}
