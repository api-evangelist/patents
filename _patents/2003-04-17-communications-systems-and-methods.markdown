{"@attributes":{"id":"description"},"BRFSUM":[{},{}],"heading":["FIELD OF THE INVENTION","BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION","SUMMARY OF THE INVENTION","DETAILED DESCRIPTION OF THE INVENTION"],"p":["Aspects of the invention relate to collaboration session communications methods, methods of configuring a plurality of collaboration sessions, communications methods, collaboration infrastructures, and communications systems.","Collaboration or collaborative sessions, including multimedia collaboration, are being utilized in an increasing number of applications to facilitate exchange of data and information. In an exemplary collaboration scenario, a group of entities communicates over the Internet and exchanges information and media to achieve a specific goal. While initial applications of collaboration sessions included text-based \u201cChat\u201d and control-based \u201cNetwork Games,\u201d more recent applications provide exchange of bandwidth intensive media in collaborative sessions. The main goal of collaboration sessions includes the exchange of data (including different types of data) between the participants of a session.","Different collaborative applications have different requirements for data flow between participants. For example, a group discussion application may need every participant to know what another participant is communicating. In contrast, a distance learning application would enable teacher(s) to talk to all or any students, but students should be allowed to talk only to teacher(s) to ask questions. Other arrangements or applications having other rules for data flow are possible.","In some arrangements, participants log into a server or server network which is configured to implement the communication of data between the participants. Rules are specified which control the flow of data based upon the type of collaboration session. Different server infrastructures are arranged to accommodate different collaboration applications. The use of different server infrastructures for respective collaboration applications has associated drawbacks inasmuch as the infrastructures may be relatively focused, inflexible devices which may not be easily configured for other types of applications.","Aspects of the present invention provide apparatus and methods for improving communications in collaboration sessions.","Aspects of the invention relate to communication of data (e.g., digital data) between a plurality of users or participants. Exemplary aspects include collaboration session communications methods, methods of configuring a plurality of collaboration sessions, communications methods, collaboration infrastructures, and communications systems.","According to one embodiment, a collaboration session communications method comprises coupling a plurality of groups of participants with a collaboration infrastructure and providing a plurality of communications rules to the collaboration infrastructure to control communications of data within a collaboration session. The method also includes outputting a communication from a first one of the groups for communication to a second one of the groups, and receiving the communication within the collaboration infrastructure after the providing. The method provides identifying the communication as originating from the first one of the groups and intended for communication to the second one of the groups, and forwarding the communication to a third one of the groups using the collaboration infrastructure and responsive to the identifying and in accordance with one of the communications rules.","According to another embodiment of the invention, a collaboration infrastructure comprises an interface configured to receive a plurality of sets of different collaboration rules, and processing circuitry configured to implement communications intermediate a plurality of participants during a plurality of collaboration sessions. Programming is also provided configured to control the processing circuitry to access the sets of different collaboration rules for respective ones of the collaboration sessions, and to control the processing circuitry to identify, for individual ones of communications of the collaboration sessions, a sending participant of the communication and to forward the communication to an appropriate recipient participant corresponding to the respective collaboration rules for the respective collaboration session.","Other embodiments and aspects are disclosed.","Aspects of the invention provide configurable collaboration infrastructures of increased flexibility that minimize the utilization of different infrastructures for different or new collaborative applications. The communications rules may be easily modified to accommodate a wide range of configurations and applications. Enforcement of communications rules at the infrastructure, such as a server, as opposed to individual participant machines, provides collaboration sessions of increased security, streamlining of collaborative work in progress, and automatic archival of content. Furthermore, if bandwidth intensive media content to be exchanged is provided in a scalable encoding format or a meta-format then the infrastructure can perform appropriate transcoding to suit the capabilities and preferences of end participants enabling heterogeneous collaboration. Scalable encoding formats and meta-formats are described in \u201cProposals for End-To-End Digital Item Adaptation Using Structured Scalable Meta-Formats (SSM),\u201d listing Debargha Mukherjee, Geraldine Kuo, Amir Said, Girodano Beretta, Sam Liu, and Shih-ta Hsiang as authors, (published October, 2002), the teachings of which are incorporated herein by reference. In such an exemplary paradigm, collaboration is provided even if end participants have diverse bandwidths, processing powers, display resolutions, etc.","At least some aspects of the invention provide a methodology for specifying data communications rules for routing content during respective multipoint collaboration sessions which may include multimedia collaboration. Configurable collaboration infrastructures are proposed in one embodiment. Dynamic configuration of collaboration infrastructures is provided in one embodiment such that multipoint sessions can be configured based on the routing requirements of the applications (e.g., games, text-based chat, media exchange, etc.) concerned.","Referring to , a plurality of exemplary collaboration sessions are respectively depicted as reference characters ,  which use a plurality of respective communications systems. Collaboration session refers to data communications within a communications system between a plurality of participants or users. In one more specific exemplary embodiment, collaboration session refers to a multipoint meeting where two or more individual participants communicate by exchange of any information, data, or media concurrently in order to achieve a specific goal.","The collaboration session  of  includes a collaboration infrastructure  of an exemplary communications system which comprises a single server  in one embodiment. A plurality of participants  are coupled with server  of collaboration infrastructure . The collaboration session  of  includes a collaboration infrastructure of an exemplary communications system which comprises a plurality of servers  in one embodiment. The servers  of collaboration infrastructure are arranged in an exemplary peer-to-peer network model in the depicted exemplary configuration. In one embodiment, collaboration infrastructure is implemented as a true peer-to-peer network wherein the servers  are symmetric and have equal rights. During communications, participants  connect to a respective one of the servers ,  in the respective collaboration infrastructures , , and the topology may dynamically change during the course of the collaborative sessions ,  as described below.","Accordingly, in one embodiment, models for organizing collaborative sessions ,  include server-based models for exchanging and\/or routing data. Instead of communicating directly with each other, individual participants  of collaboration sessions ,  communicate with the appropriate collaboration infrastructures , ","Advantages of server-based collaboration sessions ,  include improved enforcement of security since data is sent and received through the respective collaboration infrastructures , . In addition, servers of collaboration infrastructures , may be configured to provide automatic archival capability (i.e., since content is routed through the servers). Further, dependence on capabilities of participants  is minimized since bandwidth available to individual participants  and servers ,  is typically not stressed. Servers ,  may be coupled using high-speed connections, and for scalable media content, servers ,  may transcode or adapt high bandwidth content appropriately to suit the capabilities and preferences of participants , thereby allowing heterogeneous collaboration. For example, servers ,  may transcode data from one format to another format. Other arrangements of collaboration infrastructures , apart from servers are possible and may include workstations, routers, etc.","Exemplary embodiments of the present invention provide configurable collaboration infrastructures , . According to one embodiment, collaboration infrastructures , may be configured or tailored to specific collaborative applications to provide flexibility to accommodate the needs of participants . In one embodiment, the appropriate collaboration infrastructure , may be provided in a plurality of different configurations at a plurality of different moments in time to implement a plurality of different collaboration sessions.","In one embodiment, reconfiguration of the collaboration infrastructures , may include providing different communications rules which control the communications intermediate participants  during the collaboration session communications. Communications rules may also be referred to as configuration rules and exemplary communications rules specify whether individual participants  are able to output communications (i.e., transmission capabilities), and if so, which participants receive such communications (i.e., routing of transmissions). Further details regarding specification and application of communications rules are described below.","Configuration protocols may be implemented in the application layer of the 7-layer OSI model, similar to HTTP, FTP, Gopher etc., to permit, in at least one embodiment, collaboration applications of participants  to configure the respective collaboration infrastructure , appropriately for different semantic collaboration requirements. Further details regarding implementation of configuration protocols are described in Dimitri P. Bertsekas and Robert Gallagher, , (Prentice-Hall, 1992), the teachings of which are incorporated by reference.","In one arrangement, a collaboration application of a participant  may configure a multipoint collaborative session using an Application Programming Interface (API). Participants  may cause the configuration (e.g., communications rules) to be provided or conveyed to the respective collaboration infrastructure , using relevant protocols. Thereafter, data flow through the respective collaboration infrastructures , for collaborative sessions ,  is controlled in accordance with the respective communications rules specified.","Collaboration infrastructures , may run respective distributed processes to manage and route data during respective collaboration sessions , . The distributed processes running on the collaboration infrastructures , may be referred to as session organizers and exemplary details of such processes are described in Maarten Van Steen, Andrew S. Tanenbaum, , (Prentice-Hall 2002), the teachings of which are incorporated by reference. Configurable collaboration infrastructures , can simultaneously serve different collaboration applications with widely varying data flow requirements in one embodiment.","As mentioned previously, collaborative sessions ,  with specified properties can be configured using configurable collaboration infrastructures , based on application specific requirements. In one embodiment, collaborative sessions ,  may be configured remotely either at the start of the respective session or prior to the start of the respective session by specifying the communications rules in one embodiment.","Exemplary models are described for usage, session configuration and registration as described below. In one possible model, one of the participants  of individual ones of the collaboration sessions ,  may be referred to as a session creator and arranged to configure and start respective collaborative sessions , . Session information, such as password(s), session time, session name, etc., may be conveyed by respective creator participants  to a list of invitee participants  prior to sessions , , for example, using email. Then, at the specified time, the creator participants  actually connect to the respective server ,  in the respective collaboration infrastructure , , and configure and start the respective collaboration sessions , .","The configurations may include providing respective communications rules described above. As mentioned above, the collaboration infrastructures , create respective distributed processes (i.e., session organizers) running on the servers ,  of the respective collaboration infrastructures , to manage the respective collaboration sessions , . Once the respective collaboration sessions ,  are created, the invitee participants  join the appropriate collaboration sessions ,  by connecting to a respective server ,  using specified parameters. The respective session organizers authenticate incoming connection requests from participants , and admit them into the respective sessions , . While collaborative sessions ,  are in progress, participants  exchange information using communications rules previously specified. Once the collaboration sessions ,  have reached logical conclusions, the respective session creators terminate the respective collaboration sessions ,  which causes distributed session organizer objects to be discarded, and individual participants  to be disconnected.","In a first exemplary model, the session creators assign the passwords for the participants . The session creators may enjoy special powers, for example, the session creators can communicate with any participant  in the respective collaboration sessions ,  while other configuration rules may only apply to other participants .","In a second exemplary model, respective collaboration sessions ,  are pre-registered at the respective collaboration infrastructures , by the session creator at a time earlier than the actual session times. The session creators provide the appropriate communications rules to the respective collaboration infrastructures , . At registration time, the session creators specify the password(s), collaboration session names, collaboration session times, etc. The session creators can also specify an email list of invitee participants  and the collaboration infrastructures , can automatically send invitation emails to the appropriate participants . At the collaboration session times specified, the collaboration infrastructures , create distributed session organizer objects automatically to organize the respective collaboration sessions , . At the end of the time specified or when it is logical to conclude the collaboration sessions , , the session organizer objects are discarded and the respective collaboration sessions ,  are terminated. The session creators do not have to be present while the respective collaboration sessions ,  are in progress, but they can participate if needed since they know the session password(s). The session creators may also specify an administration password with which they can change certain characteristics [e.g., start and end times, etc.] of the respective collaboration sessions ,  after registration, or while the collaboration sessions are in progress.","In a third exemplary model, collaboration sessions ,  may be pre-registered but the session creators do not specify the password(s). The creators may specify a list of emails of potential participants and appropriate communications rules for the potential participants. The respective collaboration infrastructures , may automatically generate appropriate password(s), and send the collaboration session names, times and password information to the potential participants provided. The session creator cannot participate in the collaboration sessions unless he is also one of the recipients of the collaboration session information. The session creator may still have certain administrative privileges with administration passwords.","Besides the three exemplary models mentioned above, a variety of other models are possible by mixing and matching the described concepts. In accordance with exemplary embodiments of the invention, the session creators have the ability in session applications to configure the communications rules in the respective collaboration infrastructures , depending on the application specific requirements, or other criteria.","In one embodiment, a plurality of different groups of participants  having different transmission and\/or receiving capabilities are supported within a single one of collaboration sessions ,  in order to support a wide variety of collaborative applications. A subset of participants  that have common transmission and reception capabilities in the same collaboration session may be referred to as a participant group. Creation of participant groups (e.g., individual groups may have one or more individual participant ) is described below followed by an illustration of communications rules which are conveyed to the appropriate server infrastructure , in accordance with the groups of participants . The collaboration infrastructures , are configured to enforce the communications rules during communications of participants .","In one embodiment, participant groups may be automatically created by multi-tier passwords. When a collaborative session ,  is registered or created, the following information may be sent by the session creator to the respective collaboration infrastructures , : a number of participant groups, a name of individual participant groups, passwords for respective individual participant groups, maximum numbers of participants in the groups (may be unlimited), and communications rules (e.g., transmission and routing) for participant groups with respect to one another.","In one embodiment, there are as many passwords in individual collaborative sessions ,  as there are participant groups. An email sent to invitee participants  may contain only one password corresponding to the group they are supposed to join. Accordingly, assigning of passwords to participants  operates to assign the participants  to respective groups in one embodiment. In exemplary embodiments, passwords may be enforced manually by the session creator, or handled automatically by the session organizer, depending on the model being utilized. As participants  join an individual collaborative session ,  based on the password provided, they may be automatically associated with the correct group. In some arrangements, participant groups may individually have a limit on the maximum number of participants as mentioned above. The session organizer may stop accepting new connections in a group once the limit is reached.","Once participants  are placed within the appropriate respective groups, they may exchange data and media through the respective collaboration infrastructures , in accordance with the communications rules specified for the respective groups. Accordingly, a wide variety of collaborative applications may be supported by adjusting the communications rules. Exemplary communications rules and specification of communications rules are described below.","Communications rules may be specified in the form of a matrix, also referred to as a set. Communications rules are configured to control communications of participants  within the collaboration infrastructures , and collaboration sessions , . The communications rules may be and typically are different for different collaboration sessions. Accordingly, the communications rules may be configured to configure the collaboration infrastructures , differently for different collaboration sessions ,  at different moments in time.","According to one embodiment, if there are N participant groups in an individual communications session , , and G denotes the set of all groups, the communications rules may be specified in a N\u00d7N matrix R, where element Rspecifies the rules for communication from group i participants  to group j participants  as shown in Matrix A. Element Ris comprised of two items {b, L}, where bis a binary symbol (b\u03b5{0, 1}), and Lis any subset of participant groups in the session (LG). If transmission is allowed (b=1), a group i participant  can send communications to any group j participant , otherwise not (b=0). Lis null if transmission is not allowed (b=0), but if allowed (b=1), the subset Lspecifies a list of groups as a whole to which the same data or message also reaches in addition to the targeted recipient. In one embodiment, all participants  of the groups specified in the group recipient list Lreceive the same data, when any group i participant sends data to any group j participant(s). Using appropriate group recipient lists, even if b=0, it may be possible for a group i participant  to send data to a group j recipient if there are recipient participants  from other groups.",{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0049","num":"0048"},"tables":{"@attributes":{"id":"TABLE-US-00001","num":"00001"},"table":{"@attributes":{"frame":"none","colsep":"0","rowsep":"0","pgwide":"1"},"tgroup":{"@attributes":{"align":"left","colsep":"0","rowsep":"0","cols":"5"},"colspec":[{"@attributes":{"colname":"1","colwidth":"35pt","align":"center"}},{"@attributes":{"colname":"2","colwidth":"56pt","align":"left"}},{"@attributes":{"colname":"3","colwidth":"56pt","align":"left"}},{"@attributes":{"colname":"4","colwidth":"56pt","align":"left"}},{"@attributes":{"colname":"5","colwidth":"63pt","align":"left"}}],"thead":{"row":[{"entry":{"@attributes":{"namest":"1","nameend":"5","align":"center","rowsep":"1"}}},{"entry":[{},"Group 1","Group 2","\u2022 \u2022 \u2022","Group N"]},{"entry":{"@attributes":{"namest":"1","nameend":"5","align":"center","rowsep":"1"}}}]},"tbody":{"@attributes":{"valign":"top"},"row":[{"entry":["Group 1","R= {b, L}","R= {b, L}",{},"R= {b, L}"]},{"entry":["Group 2","R= {b, L}","R= {b, L}",{},{}]},{"entry":["\u2022",{},{},{},{}]},{"entry":["\u2022",{},{},"R= {b, L}",{}]},{"entry":["\u2022",{},{},{},{}]},{"entry":["Group N","R= {b, L}",{},{},"R= {b, L}"]},{"entry":{"@attributes":{"namest":"1","nameend":"5","align":"center","rowsep":"1"}}}]}}}}},{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0050","num":"0049"},"maths":{"@attributes":{"id":"MATH-US-00001","num":"00001"},"math":{"@attributes":{"overflow":"scroll"},"mtable":{"mtr":{"mtd":[{"mtable":{"mtr":[{"mtd":{"mrow":{"msub":{"mi":["b","ij"]},"mo":"\u2208","mrow":{"mo":["{","}"],"mrow":{"mn":["0","1"],"mo":","}}}}},{"mtd":{"mrow":{"msub":{"mi":["L","ij"]},"mo":"\u2062","mrow":{"mo":"{","mtable":{"mtr":[{"mtd":[{"mrow":{"mrow":{"mo":"=","mi":"\u03d5"},"mo":","}},{"mrow":{"mrow":{"mi":"if","mo":["\u2062","\u2062"],"mstyle":{"mspace":{"@attributes":{"width":"0.8em","height":"0.8ex"}}},"msub":{"mi":["b","ij"]}},"mo":"=","mn":"0"}}]},{"mtd":[{"mrow":{"mrow":{"mo":"\u2286","mi":"G"},"mo":","}},{"mrow":{"mrow":{"mi":"if","mo":["\u2062","\u2062"],"mstyle":{"mspace":{"@attributes":{"width":"0.8em","height":"0.8ex"}}},"msub":{"mi":["b","ij"]}},"mo":"=","mn":"1"}}]}]}}}}},{"mtd":{"mrow":{"mstyle":{"mspace":{"@attributes":{"width":"10.8em","height":"10.8ex"}}},"mo":"\u2062","mrow":{"mi":["G","is","the","set","of","all","participant","groups"],"mo":["\u2062","\u2062","\u2062","\u2062","\u2062","\u2062","\u2062","\u2062","\u2062","\u2062","\u2062","\u2062","\u2062","\u2062"],"mstyle":[{"mspace":{"@attributes":{"width":"0.8em","height":"0.8ex"}}},{"mspace":{"@attributes":{"width":"0.8em","height":"0.8ex"}}},{"mspace":{"@attributes":{"width":"0.8em","height":"0.8ex"}}},{"mspace":{"@attributes":{"width":"0.8em","height":"0.8ex"}}},{"mspace":{"@attributes":{"width":"0.8em","height":"0.8ex"}}},{"mspace":{"@attributes":{"width":"0.8em","height":"0.8ex"}}},{"mspace":{"@attributes":{"width":"0.8em","height":"0.8ex"}}}]}}}}]}},{"mrow":{"mi":["Matrix","A"],"mo":["\u2062","\u2062"],"mstyle":{"mspace":{"@attributes":{"width":"0.6em","height":"0.6ex"}}}}}]}}}}},"Accordingly, as described above, the appropriate collaboration infrastructure , , may receive a communication from a first or sender participant  and identify the communication as intended for a second or targeted recipient participant , and forward the communication to one or more third or additional participant  or groups of participants  responsive to the identification and in accordance with the communications rules.

Further, the communications rules may be specified to prohibit communications from a group of participants  (e.g., b=0) as described above. As shown in the exemplary matrix, the communications rules may be utilized to specify different communications within the collaboration infrastructures , for the different respective groups.

The team participants collaborate amongst themselves and their respective leaders by public or private communications. The leader participants can have public or private communication to participants in their respective team. Further, they can communicate in public and private amongst each other as a group, and also communicate with leader participants of the other team as a group. When leader participants of two teams transmit to each other, the communication is made open to leader participants of both teams in the depicted example.","The above scenarios illustrate exemplary embodiments. The communications rules may be tailored to provide other desired scenarios corresponding to the participant applications.","Collaboration infrastructures , implement communications of the respective collaborative sessions ,  according to respective sets of communications rules. In an exemplary configuration using a single server (e.g., server  of ), the single server  organizes the collaborative session  (i.e. runs an organizer process) and communications are routed through server . Server  further operates to block some communications when appropriate or expand the list of recipients for appropriate communications in accordance with the group communications rules.","Referring to configurations using a plurality of servers (e.g., servers  of ), individual participants  are distributed amongst different servers  with individual participants  connecting to a single one of the servers  in the exemplary embodiment. Referring to , an exemplary fully interconnected collaboration infrastructure for a collaboration session and an exemplary peer-to-peer collaboration infrastructure comprising a plurality of servers  for a collaboration session  are respectively illustrated.  depict exemplary collaboration sessions ,  individually including three respective servers ,  (S, Sand S) and running distributed organizer processes to conduct communications intermediate three groups of participants  (groups are indicated by P, P and P). The participants  are arbitrarily connected to the servers ,  of the respective collaboration sessions , . In exemplary arrangements, the organizer components in individual servers ,  have knowledge of the actual network-topologies of the respective collaboration infrastructures , in order to route messages appropriately.","In exemplary arrangements, participants  of the collaboration sessions ,  individually have a unique identifier, individual groups have respective unique identifiers, and individual servers ,  have respective unique identifiers in individual collaboration sessions , . The organizer components of individual servers ,  have additional information to route content in one embodiment.","For example, organizer components of individual servers ,  may include application specific information regarding the collaboration applications. For example, a participant-to-group map may be included comprising a table that maps participant identifiers to respective group identifiers. In one embodiment, this may be obtained from the passwords for the participants  provided at the time of joining a session. Additional information includes the respective communications rules matrices which may be independent of actual network topology and connectivity of the collaboration sessions , .","The organizer components may include additional information regarding the collaboration applications such as network topology and connectivity specifics of the collaboration sessions , . A participant-to-Internet Protocol (IP) address map may be provided which maps individual identifiers of participants to respective IP addresses. In one embodiment, these maps differ between the individual servers ,  (e.g., maps may only contain information for participants  that are directly connected to the respective servers). Participant-to-server maps may be provided that map, for individual participants , the identifier of the participant  to an identifier of the server ,  it is directly coupled with. Further, a server-to-server map may be provided. In one example, this map may be a 2-dim table that shows how to reach a server Sfrom a server Sin a peer-to-peer or other collaboration infrastructure. In one arrangement, the individual servers ,  are fully connected in a high-speed connection (e.g., ) and reaching any server  from any other server  utilizes a single hop transmission. However, if that is not the case (e.g.,  wherein servers Sand Sare not directly connected) the server-to-server map may provide more specific information regarding the actual collaboration infrastructure involved. For example, this can be a matrix whose (ij)entry shows the identifier of the next server to which a message must be forwarded if Sis to be reached from S.","The above-described application specific information relates to the application specific definition of groups and communications rules in respective collaborative sessions. The above-described network topology and connectivity specific information relate to actual network topologies of the collaboration infrastructures. It may be possible to optimize the participant-to-server maps and server-to-server maps dynamically based on factors such as bandwidth available for individual communication links, the bandwidth usage pattern for individual participants , a participant-to-group map, communications rules, or other criteria. In one example, a single controller node (e.g., one of the servers) may be provided in a collaboration infrastructure that gathers information from the servers and makes topology reconfiguration operations if desired. In exemplary collaboration sessions, a participant may be handed over to a different server from the one the participant was previously connected to if that is found to provide improvement from a performance point of view (e.g., bandwidth). For example, the controller node of the collaboration infrastructure may analyze a communication received from a participant and analyze the communication to determine if reconfiguration is appropriate. As the handover occurs, the participant-to-server map may be updated accordingly on all servers. If it is necessary and possible to change the server connectivity, then the server-to-server map may also be updated dynamically while a collaboration session is in progress. For servers arranged in a fully connected peer-to-peer network, and the participant-to-server map may be the only item changed for dynamic updating. Accordingly, the collaboration infrastructure may analyze a communication and reconfigure the infrastructure (e.g., handing over communications from a participant  to a different server) responsive to the analysis in at least one embodiment.","Referring to , an exemplary server  is depicted. Servers , ,  may be implemented using server  in exemplary configurations. Server  includes an interface , processing circuitry  and memory .","Interface  is configured to bi-directionally communicate with external devices, such as participants or other servers. In one arrangement, interface  receives sets of different collaboration rules from participants which may be used to configure respective collaboration sessions.","Processing circuitry  may be implemented as a microprocessor configured to execute programming (e.g., executable instructions such as firmware and\/or software, communications rules including values b, L mentioned above, or any other digital information) to control communications and other operations of server . In one embodiment, the processing circuitry  is configured to implement communications intermediate a plurality of participants during a plurality of collaboration sessions. In accordance with the described embodiment, the programming may be configured to control the processing circuitry  to access sets of different collaboration rules (e.g., from memory ) for respective ones of the collaboration sessions. For example, the programming may control the processing circuitry  to identify, for individual ones of communications of the collaboration sessions, a sending participant of the communication and to forward the communication to an appropriate recipient participant corresponding to the respective collaboration rules for the respective collaboration session.","Memory  may be arranged in any desired configuration to store digital data, including programming, communications, communications rules, and maps in exemplary arrangements. Exemplary memory  includes ROM, RAM, flash, and disk drives (e.g., hard, optical, floppy, etc.).","A discussion regarding a total number of bits utilized to implement configurable collaboration infrastructures according to one example follows. According to the above-described embodiments, Ndifferent entries Rare provided if there are N groups and individual entries may use one bit for the bcomponent of the exemplary communications rules. The list Lof the exemplary communications rules utilizes N-bits assuming one bit per group to specify whether the group exists in Lor not. Thus, in one embodiment, N+1 bits are used for individual entries, bringing the total number of bits used to N(N+1). The result can be expressed in bytes by taking a ceiling function ceil[N(N+1)\/8]. Two bytes are used for N=2, 5 bytes for N=3, 10 bytes for N=4, 19 bytes for N=5, 32 bytes for N=6, 49 bytes for N=7, and so on. It follows that aspects described above may be implemented with minimal overhead in at least one embodiment.","Utilization of raw bits may constitute the most economical way of specifying communications rules. When considering interoperability, it may be more convenient to use an XML based language to configure the collaboration infrastructures for a particular session of a given collaborative application.

Thus, from_grpid and to_grpid contain entries specified as the grpid in the <GROUP_ITEM>s above in the described example. Non-zero Rentries are specified in the example. If an entry Ris not specified in any <TX_RULE_ITEM>, it may be assumed to be {0, \u03c6) in one implementation.
