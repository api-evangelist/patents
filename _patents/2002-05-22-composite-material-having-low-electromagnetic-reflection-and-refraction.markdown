{"@attributes":{"id":"description"},"RELAPP":[{},{}],"heading":["CROSS REFERENCE","STATEMENT OF GOVERNMENT INTEREST","FIELD OF THE INVENTION","BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION","SUMMARY OF THE INVENTION","DETAILED DESCRIPTION:"],"p":["The present application claims priority under 35 U.S.C. \u00a7119 on U.S. Provisional Patent Application No. 60\/293,070 filed May 23, 2001.","This invention was made with government support under Award No. DAAD19-00-1-0525 awarded by the Army Research Office. The government has certain rights in the invention.","The present invention is related to materials having low electromagnetic reflection and refraction. The invention generally concerns materials provided to control electromagnetic reflection and refraction.","The behavior of electromagnetic radiation is altered when it interacts with charged particles. Whether these charged particles are free, as in plasmas, nearly free, as in conducting media, or restricted, as in insulating or semi conducting media\u2014the interaction between an electromagnetic field and charged particles will result in a change in one or more of the properties of the electromagnetic radiation. Because of this interaction, media and devices can be produced that generate, detect, amplify, transmit, reflect, steer, or otherwise control electromagnetic radiation for specific purposes.","The behavior of electromagnetic radiation interacting with a material can be predicted by knowledge of the material's electromagnetic materials parameters \u2208 and \u03bc where \u2208 is the electric permittivity of the medium, and \u03bc is the magnetic permeability of the medium. These parameters represent a macroscopic response averaged over the medium, the actual local response being more complicated to describe and generally not necessary to describe the electromagnetic behavior.","Reflection and transmission at the interface between two media are governed by the index of refraction \u03b7 and impedance z of each medium. The index \u03b7 and the impedance z are directly related to the reflection and transmission properties of a slab of material, and hence are the observable quantities that correspond directly to the electromagnetic performance of materials. The index of refraction \u03b7 and the impedance z can be expressed in relative terms in relation to corresponding properties for free space as:\n\n\u03b7=[(\u2208\u03bc)\/(\u2208\u03bc)]\n\n=(\u03bc\/\u2208)\/(\u03bc\/\u2208)\n\nwhere the subscript  indicates free space values associated with a vacuum. Air has very nearly the index of refraction and impedance of vacuum. Thus, the relative index of refraction and the relative electromagnetic impedance z of air are often taken to be equal to unity. Note that the permittivity and permeability can be found from the index and the impedance using the above relations, as \u2208=\u03b7\/z and \u03bc=\u03b7z.\n","In addition to having low material losses, a material that is electromagnetically \u201ctransparent\u201d will have both its index of refraction and impedance numerically close to that of the surrounding medium. Such a material is valuable for many applications. For example, airplanes may have a collision detection radar system mounted near their \u201cnose.\u201d This system operates inside a composite dome known as a radome that has a shape optimized for aerodynamic properties. The radar system must compensate for the lensing effects of the shaped radome composite material, which typically has a relative index of refraction that is significantly greater than unity. Such compensation requires effort and expense, and is subject to error.","By way of additional example, structural materials may be used to embed a sensor such as an array of antennas in a wireless communications device. Reflection and refraction effects in these structural materials are likewise undesirable. In both of these applications, material requirements, irrespective of their electromagnetic reflection and refraction properties, include physical properties such as strength, ductility, and resistance to heat, cold, and moisture. The prior art has had limited success in satisfying these needs.","Materials and methods for generally minimizing electromagnetic reflection and maximizing transparency have been proposed. For example, materials have been proposed that have a high absorption of incident radiation at microwave and other frequencies. In addition to preventing transmission of radiation, the strong absorbance of these materials often leads to a substantial reflected component. As a result, use of these materials is usually accompanied by irregular material shapes and surface angles required to direct the reflected component in a desired direction. The required irregular surface angles and shapes significantly limit the utility of such materials and methods.","Also, the prior art has employed particular naturally occurring media that may be found in nature or that can be formed by known chemical synthesis and that may have a low level of electromagnetic reflection over a particular frequency range. Use of such media is disadvantageously limited to these particular frequency ranges. Also, it is difficult to find media with significant permeability at RF and higher frequencies. These media may also be structurally unsuitable for many applications.","Previous study of the effects of so-called \u201cartificial dielectric\u201d materials on electromagnetic waves has been performed. For example, artificial dielectric materials based on arrays of substructures that collectively have a desired response to electromagnetic radiation have been studied. These arrays, which need not necessarily be periodic in nature, have in common that the dimensions and spacing of the scattering elements are less than the wavelengths over which the composite material will operate. It is found that by averaging the local electromagnetic fields over such a structure, an effective permittivity (and\/or permeability) function can be applied that roughly describes the scattering properties of the composite. The procedure that arrives at this description is known in the literature as \u201ceffective medium theory.\u201d","An example of a prior art artificial dielectric material is the \u201crodded\u201d medium, used as an analogue medium to study propagation of electromagnetic waves through the ionosphere [See, e.g., R. N. Bracewell, \u201cAnalogues of an Ionized Medium\u201d, Wireless Engineer, 31:320-6, December 1954, herein incorporated by reference]. An artificial medium based on conducting wires or posts has a dielectric function identical to that describing a dilute, collisionless neutral plasma. Accordingly, as used herein a medium based on conducting wires will be referred to as a \u201cplasmonic\u201d medium. More recently, artificial plasmonic media have been proposed using, for example, a periodic arrangement of very thin conducting wires. See, e.g., J. B. Pendry et al., \u201cExtremely low frequency plasmons in metallic mesostructures\u201d, Physical Review Letters, 76(25):4771-6, 1996; see also D. R. Smith et al., \u201cLoop-wire for investigating plasmons at microwave frequencies,\u201d Applied Physics Letters, 75(10):1425-7, 1999; both of which are incorporated herein by reference.","Other recent examples of artificial dielectrics include the use of random arrangements of metal \u201cneedles\u201d suspended in a foam structure as a \u201clens\u201d with an index of refraction greater than unity. Many foam-like materials have a refractive index approximately equal to unity. Adding needles serves to increase the index for low-frequency RF radiation as with radio astronomy. These materials, however, are not acceptable for applications requiring a degree of mechanical strength.","To date, these prior art efforts have not been successful in providing materials that have a low reflectance and good transparency at a desired wavelength in addition to having advantageous structural mechanical properties.","Unresolved needs in the art therefore exist.","The present invention is directed to a composite material comprising a host dielectric medium having an index of refraction greater than 1, and an artificial plasmon medium embedded in the host medium. The artificial plasmon medium has a dielectric function of less than one so that the permittivity of the composite material is substantially equal to that of the surrounding medium for incident electromagnetic radiation of a desired frequency.","Composite media of the invention thus can be of utility as materials that are highly transparent and exhibit minimal reflectance or refraction for electromagnetic waves in a desired frequency range. Also, composite media embodiments of the present invention can be \u201ctuned\u201d for achieving transparency and\/or minimal reflection and refraction for electromagnetic waves in the desired frequency range through selection of particular conductor\/host materials, conductor\/host sizing and\/or spacing, and conductor\/host geometric configuration. Further, composite media of the present invention allow for achieving these desired electromagnetic properties (e.g., transparency and low reflection) while providing advantageous structural and mechanical properties, with the result that embodiments of the present invention will be well suited for applications such as radomes, antennas, and the like.","The above brief description sets forth broadly some of the features and advantages of the present disclosure so that the detailed description that follows may be better understood.","In order to describe the best known modes of practice of the present invention, it will be useful to first discuss some relevant properties and relationships of physics. The wavelength \u03bb, the frequency f of electromagnetic radiation, and the velocity v are related by:\n\nv=\u03bbf\n\nThe angular frequency \u03c9 is related to the frequency by a constant:\n\n\u03c9=2\u03c0f\n\nIn dimensionless quantities, then, ratios of frequencies can be used interchangeably:\n\n()=(\u03c9\/\u03c9)\n","In order to describe the presence of a material, Maxwell's equations must be solved in the presence of the material. The local electromagnetic response of a material\u2014the exact electric and magnetic field distributions that occur near the atoms or elements that compose the material\u2014will in general be very complicated. However, since the exact nature of the local fields in a material is usually unimportant to the behavior of the electromagnetic waves propagating through the material, the local fields are typically averaged to obtain a set of Maxwell's equations that includes the material properties in two parameters: \u2208 and \u03bc.","A simple example of an idealized medium is the Drude medium, which in certain limits describes such systems as conductors and dilute plasmas. The averaging process leads to a permittivity that, as a function frequency, has the form\n\n\u2208()\/\u2208=1() \u2003\u2003EQTN. A\n\nwhere f is the electromagnetic excitation frequency, fis the plasma frequency and v is a damping factor. In general, the plasma frequency may be thought of as a limit on wave propagation through a medium: waves propagate when the frequency is greater than the plasma frequency, and waves do not propagate (e.g., are reflected) when the frequency is less than the plasma frequency. Simple conducting systems (such as plasmas) have a dispersive dielectric response. The degree to which an artificial medium obeys EQTN. A must often be determined empirically and depends on the construction materials and on the geometric properties that determine frelative to the inter-element spacing of the metal scattering elements.\n","The plasma frequency is the natural frequency of charge density oscillations (\u201cplasmons\u201d), and may be expressed as:\n\n\u03c9\/\u2208]\n\nand\n\n=\u03c9\/2\u03c0\n\nwhere nis the charge carrier density and mis an effective carrier mass. For the carrier densities associated with typical conductors, the plasma frequency fusually occurs in the optical or ultraviolet bands.\n","The Pendry reference that has been incorporated herein by reference teaches a thin wire media\u2014in which the wire diameters are significantly smaller than the skin depth of the metal\u2014can be engineered with a plasma frequency in the microwave regime, below the point at which diffraction due to the finite wire spacing occurs. By restricting the currents to flow in thin wires, the effective charge density is reduced, thereby lowering the plasma frequency. Also, the inductance associated with the wires acts as an effective mass that is larger than that of the electrons, further reducing the plasma frequency. By incorporating these effects, the Pendry reference provides the following prediction for the plasma frequency of a thin wire medium:",{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0041","num":"0040"},"maths":{"@attributes":{"id":"MATH-US-00001","num":"00001"},"math":{"@attributes":{"overflow":"scroll"},"mrow":{"msubsup":{"mi":["f","p"],"mn":"2"},"mo":"=","mrow":{"mfrac":{"mn":"1","mrow":{"mn":"2","mo":"\u2062","mi":"\u03c0"}},"mo":"\u2062","mrow":{"mo":["(",")"],"mfrac":{"mrow":[{"msubsup":{"mi":"c","mn":["0","2"]},"mo":"\/","msup":{"mi":"d","mn":"2"}},{"mrow":[{"mi":"ln","mo":"\u2061","mrow":{"mo":["(",")"],"mfrac":{"mi":["d","r"]}}},{"mfrac":{"mn":["1","2"]},"mo":"\u2062","mrow":{"mo":["(",")"],"mrow":{"mn":"1","mo":"+","mrow":{"mi":["ln","\u03c0"],"mo":["\u2062","\u2062"],"mstyle":{"mspace":{"@attributes":{"width":"0.3em","height":"0.3ex"}}}}}}}],"mo":"-"}]}}}}}},"br":{},"sub":"0 "},"By way of example, the Pendry reference suggests a wire radius of approximately one micron for a lattice spacing of 1 cm\u2014resulting in a ratio, d\/r, on the order of or greater than 10. Note that the charge mass and density that generally occurs in the expression for the fare replaced by the parameters (e.g., d and r) of the wire medium. Note also that the interpretation of the origin of the \u201cplasma\u201d frequency for a composite structure is not essential to this invention, only that the frequency-dependent permittivity have the form as above, with the plasma (or cutoff) frequency occurring in the microwave range or other desired ranges.","Any conducting element that has an inductance can also be utilized as the repeated element that forms a plasmonic medium. In the thin wire medium, increased inductance is primarily achieved by making the wires very thin; However, the inductance can also be increased by other means, such as arranging inductive loops within the medium, or even the inclusion of actual inductive elements within the circuit. Thicker loop-wire media can be comprised, for example, of wire coils or wire lengths having periodic loops.","An embodiment of the present invention is directed to a composite, or hybrid, material comprised of a host dielectric with an artificial plasmon medium embedded therein, whereby the composite material has an index of refraction and impedance both substantially equal to that of the surrounding medium. As discussed below, it is assumed that the index of refraction and impedance of the medium are both measured relative to the surrounding medium, and accordingly the term \u201crelative\u201d as used herein in describing terms such as \u201cindex\u201d and \u201cimpedance\u201d is intended to refer to a comparison to the surrounding medium. An invention embodiment may be considered an artificial plasmon medium. Behavior of embodiments of the present invention is modeled on the assumption that the host dielectric has a uniform dielectric constant or function (it is noted that as used herein the terms dielectric constant and dielectric function are intended to be interchangeable). However, an effective dielectric function of the host medium can be substituted for the uniform constant and the properties in the frequency range of interest will be substantially unchanged.","The conductivity of the conducting elements of the composite embodiments of the present invention approaches infinity, but any good metal conductor such as copper or silver provides a close behavioral agreement to ideal simulations. For the composite material, the effective permittivity \u2208is expressed as:\n\n\u2208\/\u2208=\u2208\/\u2208\u2212(\u03c9\/\u03c9)\n\nwhere \u2208is the permittivity of the host material and \u03c9 is the angular frequency of the electromagnetic radiation. Using the above relations, it may be derived that:\n\n\u03b7=[\u2208\/\u2208\u2212()]\n","The composite materials of the present invention follow these relationships, and achieve good transparency and low reflectance for electromagnetic radiation in a desired frequency range. By way of example, a conductor of the present invention may be varied in spacing and\/or geometry to control the plasma frequency \u03c9,and thereby \u201ctune\u201d the composite of the invention.","In the absence of the dielectric, the only variable parameter for behavior of a plasmon medium is the plasma frequency f,with the index of refraction able to be expressed as\n\n\u03b7=(\u03ba)=[1\u2212()]\n\nwhere \u03ba=\u2208\/\u2208. The dielectric function of the composite of course changes upon addition of the dielectric. The presence of a dielectric matrix into which the plasmon medium is embedded will result in a polarization response that can be accounted for by introducing \u03basuch that:\n\n\u03ba=\u03ba\u2212()\n\nwhere \u03ba is the effective dielectric constant of an ideal plasmon\/dielectric composite material. The dipolar response term \u03bais substantially equal to the effective dielectric constant of the polymer composite matrix in the absence of the integrated artificial plasmon medium when that medium closely obeys EQTN. A and also occupies a negligible volume fraction of the composite.\n","With the addition of the dielectric host matrix, the dielectric constant or function \u03ba takes a value of unity at a finite frequency f=f\/(\u03ba\u22121). The frequency fmay be referred to as the \u201cmatch frequency,\u201d the frequency at which \u03ba=1, the index \u03b7=1, and there is substantially no refraction at an interface between air and the ideal composite material.","The frequency at which \u03ba=0 determines the onset of electromagnetic wave propagation. This \u201cturn-on\u201d frequency is given by:",{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0050","num":"0049"},"maths":{"@attributes":{"id":"MATH-US-00002","num":"00002"},"math":{"@attributes":{"overflow":"scroll"},"mrow":{"msub":{"mi":"f","mn":"0"},"mo":"=","mfrac":{"msub":{"mi":["f","p"]},"msqrt":{"mrow":{"msub":{"mi":"\u03ba","mn":"0"},"mo":"-","mn":"1"}}}}}},"br":{},"figref":["FIGS. 1(","FIG. 1","FIG. 1("],"i":["a","b","a","b"],"b":"1","sub":["0 ","0 ","1 ","0 ","p","0 ","n=1.1","n=0.9","1","0 "]},"The present invention may be further described through reference to example structural embodiments.

The composite material  comprises a dielectric host  and a conductor  embedded therein. It is noted that the term \u201cdielectric\u201d as used herein in reference to a material is intended to broadly refer to materials that have a relative dielectric constant greater than 1, where the relative dielectric constant is expressed as the ratio of the material permittivity \u2208 to free space permittivity \u2208(8.85\u00d710F\/m). In more general terms, dielectric materials may be thought of as materials that are poor electrical conductors but that are efficient supporters of electrostatic fields. In practice most dielectric materials, but not all, are solid. Examples of dielectric materials useful for practice of embodiments of the current invention include, but are not limited to, porcelain such as ceramics, mica, glass, and plastics such as thermoplastics, polymers, resins, and the like.","The term conductor as used herein is intended to broadly refer to materials that provide a useful means for conducting current. By way of example, many metals are known to provide relatively low electrical resistance with the result that they may be considered conductors. Preferred conductors for the practice of embodiments of the invention include aluminum, copper, gold, and silver.","As illustrated by , the preferred conductor  comprises a plurality of portions that are generally elongated and parallel to one another, with a space between portions of distance d. Preferably, d is less than the size of a wavelength of the incident electromagnetic waves. Spacing by distances d of this order allow the composite material of the invention to be modeled as a continuous medium for determination of permittivity \u2208. Also, the preferred conductors  have a generally cylindrical shape.","A most preferred conductor  comprises thin copper wires. These conductors offer the advantages of being readily commercially available at a low cost, and of being relatively easy to work with. Also, matrices of thin wiring have been shown to be useful for comprising an artificial plasmon medium, as discussed by Pendry et al., \u201cExtremely Low Frequency Plasmons in Metallic Mesostructures,\u201d Physical Review Letters, 76(25):4773-6, 1996; incorporated by reference herein.",{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0055","num":"0054"},"figref":["FIG. 3","FIG. 3"],"b":["20","20","22","24","10","24","20","24","1","2","1","2","1","2","24","1","2","24","1","2"]},"As illustrated, the individual conductors may be thought of as organized in a plurality of planar layers separated from one another by the distance d, as shown in the perspective schematic representation of  where each planar layer  represents a plurality of parallel conductors , and where the dielectric host  is illustrated as a transparent dashed line \u201cbox\u201d. The embodiment  may also be thought of as having each plane of its conductors  in a single \u201cdimension.\u201d That is, the conductors  in each plane generally lie along a single axis of orientation (e.g., the x-axis).","Other embodiments of the invention will comprise conductors oriented along more than one axis of orientation. The composite material embodiment  represented by , for example, illustrates the conductors  oriented along two axes and embedded in a dielectric host . The conductors  in the composite material embodiment  may be thought to generally extend along both the x-axis and the y-axis. This is illustrated schematically in , with the conductors  represented as lines, and the dielectric host  represented as a dashed line box. Such a configuration thereby can also be considered to have a plurality of first conductors  organized into substantially planar rows, and a plurality of second conductors  organized into substantially planar columns. When laid out along an x and y axis as in the embodiment , these planes are substantially normal to one another. The planar columns are preferably separated from one another by a distance less than a wavelength of electromagnetic wave of interest, with the planar rows likewise preferably spaced.","Other invention embodiments may additionally comprise conductors oriented along additional axes.

Indeed, depending on a particular application it may be desirable to \u201ctune\u201d the composite material by altering the electrical properties of the conductor.
