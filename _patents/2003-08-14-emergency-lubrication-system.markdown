title: Emergency lubrication system
abstract: An emergency lubrication system for a turbine engine includes a reservoir  containing a reserve quantity of lubricant  and having a lubricant inlet  and a lubricant outlet . A lubricant supply line  and a lubricant outlet line  each have a respective valves  for regulating lubricant flow into and out of the reservoir. A fluid supply line  includes a valve  for selectively establishing communication between the reserve quantity of lubricant and a source of pressurized fluid. During normal operation the lubricant outlet valve continuously releases lubricant at a normal rate to the component requiring lubrication while the lubricant inlet valve concurrently admits fresh lubricant into the reservoir. During abnormal operation, the lubricant inlet valve closes in response to abnormally low lubricant pressure outside the reservoir thereby preventing backflow of reserve lubricant out of the reservoir. The fluid inlet valve opens to admit pressurized fluid into the reservoir thus pressurizing the reserve lubricant. The lubricant outlet valve opens or cycles open and closed in response to a command from a controller  so that the pressurized fluid forces lubricant through the outlet  as a subnormal rate, which persists until the lubricant reserve is substantially depleted. The subnormal rate is ideally achieved by intermittently releasing lubricant from the reservoir, but may also be achieved by releasing a continuous stream of lubricant at a rate less than the normal rate of release.

{"@attributes":{"id":"description"},"GOVINT":[{},{}],"heading":["STATEMENT OF GOVERNMENT INTEREST","TECHNICAL FIELD","BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION","SUMMARY OF THE INVENTION","BEST MODE FOR CARRYING OUT THE INVENTION"],"p":["This invention was made under a U.S. Government Contract. The Government has certain rights in the invention.","This invention relates to lubrication systems and particularly to a turbine engine lubrication system capable of supplying lubricant for a limited time following a failure or malfunction of a lubrication system component.","Lubrication systems, such as those used in aircraft gas turbine engines, supply lubricant to bearings, gears and other engine components that require lubrication. The lubricant, typically oil, cools the components and protects them from wear. A typical oil lubrication system includes conventional components such as an oil tank, pump and filter.","If one of the lubrication system components fails, malfunctions or sustains damage, the oil supply to the lubricated component may be disrupted resulting in irreparable damage to the component and undesirable corollary consequences. For example, if an engine oil pump fails, the resulting loss of oil pressure could disable the engine by causing overheating and\/or seizure of the bearings that support the engine shaft. An aircraft engine that becomes disabled in flight is obviously a concern, especially if the engine powers a single-engine military aircraft operating in hostile airspace.","It is known to accommodate the possibility of a failure in the oil system by configuring the system so that it continues to supply oil to the lubricated components for a limited time, thereby enabling continued temporary operation of the engine. Such a system allows the aircraft crew time to safely shut down the engine or to take other appropriate actions to safeguard the aircraft and its occupants. In a military aircraft, such a system can provide the crew with valuable additional time to return to friendly airspace.","An emergency lubrication system for an aircraft engine should possess several desirable attributes. The system should provide emergency lubrication for as long as possible, but should not add significantly to aircraft weight or consume precious space by requiring that the aircraft carry a large reserve of emergency lubricant. Moreover, it is desirable that any reserve quantity of lubricant be continuously replenished. Otherwise the properties of the reserve lubricant could degrade over time, rendering the lubricant unsuitable for use when called upon in an emergency. The emergency system should also make as much use as possible of the existing non-emergency lubrication system hardware and lubricant flowpaths, thus avoiding the weight, cost and complexity of dedicated emergency hardware. The system should also operate autonomously, i.e. without requiring that the aircraft crew take any action to engage the system.","Some known lubrication systems use high pressure to deliver a high velocity stream of lubricant during normal operation, but provide a low velocity mist or gravity induced flow of lubricant during abnormal or emergency conditions. Despite the merits of these systems, they may not be satisfactory for all applications. For example, intershaft bearings, such as those used between corotating or counterrotating shafts of a turbine engine, normally receive lubricant by way of a lubricant flowpath that includes scoops projecting from the exterior of a shaft and lubricant passageways (which may include the shaft bore) extending axially through a shaft. The scoops receive pressurized lubricant from the lubricant pumps mounted on the nonrotating structure of the engine and convey that lubricant to the passageways, which then guide the lubricant to the intershaft bearings. Because the scoops and passageways are designed to receive and transport high velocity lubricant, they may not work satisfactorily with low velocity lubricant such as a lubricant mist or a gravity induced lubricant stream. Hence, if it is desired to use the existing lubricant flowpath under emergency operating conditions, it is advantageous to maintain lubricant pressure despite the failure of one or more of the lubrication system components. Although it might be possible to include auxiliary features and hardware that allow low pressure emergency lubricant (e.g. a mist or gravity induced stream) to bridge the interface between the nonrotating structure and the rotating shafts and adequately lubricate the bearing, doing so would introduce undesirable weight, cost and complexity.","It is, therefore, an object of the invention to provide an emergency lubrication system for a gas turbine engine that allows continued operation of the engine for as long as possible following failure of a system component and accompanying loss of oil pressure. Further objects are that the system be light weight and compact and that it operate autonomously.","According to the invention, a lubrication system for a turbine engine includes a reservoir containing a reserve quantity of lubricant and having a lubricant inlet and a lubricant outlet. During a normal mode of operation, the reservoir receives lubricant through the inlet while concurrently releasing lubricant from the outlet at a normal rate. The system also includes a means for resisting backflow of reserve lubricant through the inlet and for effecting a subnormal rate of lubricant release during abnormal operation, such as when the lubricant pressure becomes abnormally low. The subnormal rate of release persists until the lubricant reserve is substantially depleted. The subnormal rate is ideally achieved by intermittently releasing lubricant from the reservoir, but may also be achieved be releasing a continuous stream of lubricant at a rate less than the normal rate of release.","In one detailed embodiment of the invention, a lubricant supply line and a lubricant outlet line have a lubricant inlet valve and a lubricant outlet valve, respectively, for regulating lubricant flow into and out of the reservoir. A fluid supply line employs a fluid inlet valve to selectively establish communication between the reserve quantity of lubricant and a source of pressurized motive fluid. During normal operation, the fluid inlet valve isolates the reservoir from the pressurized fluid while the lubricant outlet valve continuously releases lubricant to the component requiring lubrication and the lubricant inlet valve concurrently admits fresh lubricant into the reservoir. During abnormal operation, the lubricant inlet valve closes in response to abnormally low lubricant pressure outside the reservoir thereby resisting backflow of reserve lubricant out of the reservoir. The fluid inlet valve opens to admit pressurized fluid into the reservoir thus pressurizing the reserve lubricant. The lubricant outlet valve cycles open and closed to intermittently release lubricant under the influence of the pressure applied by the pressurized fluid.","One advantage of the invention is that it affords the aircraft crew an interval of time to shut down the affected engine and\/or take other actions necessary to safeguard the aircraft and its occupants. The subnormal rate of lubricant release conserves lubricant, thus prolonging the time interval. Another advantage is that the emergency system takes advantage of existing non-emergency components, rather than requiring additional auxiliary components. This ensures that the system is simple, reliable, compact, light weight and inexpensive.","Referring to , an aircraft gas turbine engine  includes low pressure and high pressure compressors , , a combustor , and high pressure and low pressure turbines , . A low speed shaft  couples the low pressure compressor to the low pressure turbine. A high speed shaft  couples the high pressure compressor to the high pressure turbine. An engine controller  issues control signals C to various engine valves and actuators in response to demand signals D from the aircraft pilot and feedback signals F from the engine.","Bearings  support the low speed shaft from the nonrotatable engine structure. Intershaft bearings  support the high speed shaft from the low speed shaft. The bearings are enclosed in bearing compartments . A lubrication system, which typically includes an oil tank, pump, filters and deaerators, supplies a lubricant to the bearing compartments, and thus to the bearings, by way of a main lubricant flowpath, which is schematically represented in the illustration as a conduit . The lubricant cools and lubricates the bearings.","An annular, working medium fluid flowpath  circumscribes an axially extending centerline  and extends axially through the engine. During operation, the compressors pressurize a working medium fluid, specifically ambient air. The pressurized air supports combustion of a fuel in the combustor. The resulting products of combustion flow through the turbines, which power the compressors by way of shafts , .","Although most of the air flowing through the compressors enters the combustor, a portion of the air may be extracted from the compressors for other uses. For example, it is customary to divert a quantity of pressurized air  to the vicinity just outside the bearing compartments . The diverted air is at a pressure slightly higher than the prevailing pressure inside the bearing compartments and therefore helps to resist lubricant leakage out of the compartments. This diverted air  is referred to as buffer air.","A lubricant reservoir  is mounted on the nonrotating structure of the engine. The reservoir holds a reserve quantity of lubricant . The reservoir has a lubricant inlet , a lubricant outlet  and a fluid inlet . A lubricant supply line , which branches off the main lubricant flowpath , extends to the lubricant inlet . A lubricant inlet valve , represented by check valve , regulates lubricant flow through the lubricant inlet . The check valve operates passively in response to local lubricant pressure, i.e. its position is directly governed by local influences acting on the valve, specifically the difference in lubricant pressure on either side of the valve.","A lubricant outlet line  extends from the lubricant outlet  to convey lubricant to the bearings. A lubricant outlet valve , represented by electrically powered solenoid operated valve , regulates lubricant flow through the lubricant outlet . The solenoid valve is a nonpassive valve, i.e. its position is governed by the solenoid acting in response to control signal C, not by local influences acting directly on the valve. Although the solenoid valve is a two position valve, variants of the invention may benefit from or even require a modulating valve. Moreover, other types of valves, such as mechanically, hydraulically or pneumatically driven valves may also be used.","A fluid supply line  extends from the fluid inlet  to a source of pressurized fluid. A fluid inlet valve , represented by check valve , selectively establishes communication between the reserve quantity of lubricant  and a source of pressurized fluid. In the illustrated example, the pressurized fluid is a portion of the bearing compartment buffer air .","During a normal mode of engine operation, a main lubrication circuit provides high pressure lubricant to the bearing compartments. The pressure of the lubricant in the main circuit opens lubricant inlet check valve so that a fraction of the main lubricant supply also enters the reservoir  to establish a reserve quantity of pressurized lubricant  therein. The reserve quantity need be established only on a new or recently serviced engine because, as the reader will soon appreciate, the reserve quantity remains confined in the reservoir, although it is continuously extracted and replenished during normal engine operation. The check valve remains open as long as the lubricant supply pressure exceeds the pressure in the reservoir.","During normal operation, the solenoid valve is commanded to its open position by the controller. As a result, reserve lubricant is continuously released from the reservoir at a normal rate. Replenishment of the reserve lubricant occurs as a result of fresh lubricant admitted to the reservoir through inlet . Consequently, the reserve lubricant is not susceptible to age related degradation. The fluid inlet check valve remains closed because the pressure in the reservoir exceeds that of the buffer air .","In the event that a malfunction or failure in the main lubricant circuit disrupts the lubricant supply to the bearing, the attendant reduction or complete loss of main lubricant pressure causes check valve to close, thus resisting backflow of reserve lubricant through the lubricant inlet . To the extent that the solenoid valve remains open, reserve lubricant continues to flow from the reservoir to the bearing. The continued release of lubricant begins depressurizing the reservoir so that fluid inlet check valve opens, thereby establishing communication between the reserve lubricant  and the pressurized buffer air . The buffer air maintains pressure on the reserve lubricant to force it through the outlet line  to the bearing. As pointed out previously, maintaining pressure on the lubricant may be highly advisible if the lubricant must pass through a lubricant flowpath leading to an intershaft bearing or other lubricant flowpath not designed to accept low pressure lubricant. The pressurization of the lubricant by the buffer air causes a pressurized stream of lubricant to be released from the reservoir.","In order to conserve lubricant, a suitable sensor, such as a pressure sensor in the main lubricant circuit, detects the disruption of the lubricant supply and informs the controller . The controller then issues a command Cto lubricant outlet valve  to effect a subnormal rate of lubricant release through the lubricant outlet . The command Cmay cause the valve  to cycle between its open and closed positions, in which case the subnormal release of lubricant is an intermittent release. The intermittent release is desirable because it is highly effective at conserving lubricant, and therefore provides for a long interval of emergency operation in the abnormal mode. Moreover, we have discovered that the intermittent application of lubricant, although not satisfactory for normal operation, is satisfactory for emergency operation. Alternatively, the command Cmay cause the valve  to remain open or partially open, in which case the subnormal release of lubricant is a continuous release at a rate lower than the rate of release in the normal mode of operation. Either way, the subnormal release persists until the reserve quantity of lubricant  is substantially depleted","Because the above described system enables the engine to continue operating after failure of a system component, pressurized air  continues to be available to pressurize the reserve lubricant and force lubricant to the bearing. As a result, the operation of the engine is sustained, albeit in an abnormal operating mode. The sustained operation of the engine ensures an uninterrupted supply of pressurized air to the reservoir so that the bearings continue to receive lubricant and the engine continues to operate in the abnormal mode. Because the lubricant flows from the reservoir at a subnormal rate, the bearing will likely experience highly accelerated wear and require replacement. Nevertheless, the subnormal quantity of lubricant is adequate to keep the engine operating safely until the lubricant reserve in the reservoir is depleted. The aircraft crew can take advantage of this additional interval of operation to systematically follow the procedures necessary to safeguard the aircraft and its occupants and to safely shut the engine down before the bearings sieze or overheat. If the engine powers a military aircraft operating in hostile airspace, the crew can use the interval of extended operation to proceed toward friendly airspace.","Although  depicts a parallel flow configuration, a series flow configuration, as depicted in , may also be employed. In the series flow configuration the supply line  to the reservoir and the lubricant outlet line  are the exclusive vehicle for supplying lubricant to the bearing. All lubricant destined for the bearing traverses through the reservoir during the normal mode of operation.",{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0030","num":"0029"},"figref":"FIG. 3","b":["72","72","66","64","72","54","56","64","26","72","72","42","56","72","72"],"i":["b","a ","b ","a ","b ","b ","b "]},"In the above described embodiments, the lubricant inlet valve , fluid inlet valve  and the lubricant outlet valve  (when present) and the coordinated operation of these valves offer an effective way to resist backflow of reserve lubricant out of the reservoir and to effect a subnormal rate of lubricant release during the abnormal mode of operation.",{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0032","num":"0031"},"figref":["FIG. 4","FIG. 1"],"b":["50","52","76","78","72","72","42","68","68","66","72","42","68","72","68"],"i":["b ","b ","b ","b "]},"The embodiment of  does not continually refresh the lubricant in the reservoir.
