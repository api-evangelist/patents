Little, James Godfrey, Marc Plumb, Michael Brown, and Neil Adams; all of which are incorporated by reference herein.","The present patent application generally relates to wireless packet data service networks. More particularly, and not by way of any limitation, the present patent application is directed to a system and method for porting a personalized indicium assigned to a mobile communications device that is operable to be disposed in a wireless packet data service network.","It is becoming commonplace to use wireless packet data service networks for effectuating data sessions with mobile communications devices. In some implementations, indicia such as Personal Information Numbers or PINs are assigned to the devices in order to facilitate certain aspects of service provisioning, e.g., security, validation and service authentication, et cetera. In such scenarios, it becomes imperative that no two devices have the same indicium (i.e., collision). Further, such PIN indicia are mapped to individual Internet Protocol (IP) addresses used in packet-switched networks so that a mobile communications device continues to send and receive messages even if its IP address is changed for some reason. For example, wireless carriers may dynamically assign an IP address to a data-enabled mobile device, and if that device is out of coverage, the previously assigned IP address is reclaimed and recycled for another device requesting service.","In addition, unique PIN indicia may be used for effectuating peer-to-peer type communications over a wireless carrier, e.g., direct messaging between two handheld devices, wherein the PINs assigned to the devices are used as messaging addresses. Accordingly, when a device is returned for repair or the user needs to switch to another device, possibly temporarily, the PIN address will have to be updated appropriately by all members of the user's contact list maintained with respect to the peer-to-peer messaging service. On the other hand, the user's identity for other types of communication, e.g., email address, may remain the same, however. Clearly, such a scenario is inconvenient for the subscribers as well as their contact members, and raises a challenging issue regarding PIN-based information management at the network level.","In one embodiment, a scheme is provided for porting a personalized indicium, i.e., a Personal Information Number or PIN, from a first mobile communications device to a second mobile communications device. Upon receiving identity information from the first mobile communications device via a secure peer-to-peer communication session, the second mobile communications device is operable to negotiate with a network node using at least a portion of the received identity information for reassigning the PIN to an identifier associated therewith (i.e., device or subscriber identifiers such as IMEI, IMSI, ESN, MIN, et cetera). After successfully porting the PIN to the second mobile communications device, a service provisioning database is accordingly updated.","In another embodiment, a PIN porting method is disclosed which comprises: transferring identity information from a first mobile communications device to a second mobile communications device, the first mobile communications device's personalized indicium comprising a PIN that is mapped to an identifier associated therewith; and negotiating by the second mobile communications device with a network node using at least a portion of the identity information for reassigning the PIN to an identifier associated with the second mobile communications device.","In another embodiment, a mobile communications device is disclosed which comprises: logic means operable to engage in a communication session with another mobile communications device having a personalized indicium comprised of a PIN, wherein the PIN is mapped to an identifier relating to another mobile communications device; and logic means operable for negotiating with a network node using at least a portion of identity information received from the another mobile communications device for reassigning the PIN to an identifier associated with the mobile communications device.","In yet another embodiment, a network system is disclosed for porting a personalized indicium from a first mobile communications device to a second mobile communications device, which comprises: means for transferring identity information from the first mobile communications device to the second mobile communications device, the first mobile communications device's personalized indicium comprising a PIN that is mapped to an identifier associated therewith; and means for negotiating by the second mobile communications device with a network node using at least a portion of the identity information for reassigning the PIN to an identifier associated with the second mobile communications device.","A system and method of the present patent application will now be described with reference to various examples of how the embodiments can best be made and used. Like reference numerals are used throughout the description and several views of the drawings to indicate like or corresponding parts, wherein the various elements are not necessarily drawn to scale. Referring now to the drawings, and more particularly to , depicted therein is an exemplary network environment  including a wireless packet data service network  wherein an embodiment of the present patent application may be practiced. An enterprise network , which may be a packet-switched network, can include one or more geographic sites and be organized as a local area network (LAN), wide area network (WAN) or metropolitan area network (MAN), et cetera, for serving a plurality of corporate users. A number of application servers - through -N disposed as part of the enterprise network  are operable to provide or effectuate a host of internal and external services such as email, video mail, Internet access, corporate data access, messaging, calendaring and scheduling, information management, and the like. Accordingly, a diverse array of personal information appliances such as desktop computers, laptop computers, palmtop computers, et cetera, although not specifically shown in , may be operably networked to one or more of the application servers -, i=1, 2, . . . , N, with respect to the services supported in the enterprise network .","Additionally, a remote services server  may be interfaced with the enterprise network  for enabling a corporate user to access or effectuate any of the services from a remote location using a suitable mobile communications device (MCD) . A secure communication link with end-to-end encryption may be established that is mediated through an external IP network, i.e., a public packet-switched network such as the Internet , as well as the wireless packet data service network  operable with MCD  via suitable wireless network infrastructure that includes a base station (BS) . In one embodiment, a trusted relay network  may be disposed between the Internet  and the infrastructure of wireless packet data service network . In another embodiment, the infrastructure of the trusted relay network  may be integrated with the wireless packet data service network , whereby the functionality of the relay infrastructure, certain aspects of which will be described in greater detail below, is consolidated as a separate layer within a \u201cone-network\u201d environment. Additionally, by way of example, MCD  may be a data-enabled mobile handheld device capable of receiving and sending messages, web browsing, interfacing with corporate application servers, et cetera, regardless of the relationship between the networks  and . Accordingly, a \u201cnetwork node\u201d may include both relay functionality and wireless network infrastructure functionality in some exemplary implementations.","For purposes of the present patent application, the wireless packet data service network  may be implemented in any known or heretofore unknown mobile communications technologies and network protocols, as long as a packet-switched data service is available therein for transmitting packetized information. For instance, the wireless packet data service network  may be comprised of a General Packet Radio Service (GPRS) network that provides a packet radio access for mobile devices using the cellular infrastructure of a Global System for Mobile Communications (GSM)-based carrier network. In other implementations, the wireless packet data service network  may comprise an Enhanced Data Rates for GSM Evolution (EDGE) network, an Integrated Digital Enhanced Network (IDEN), a Code Division Multiple Access (CDMA) network, a Universal Mobile Telecommunications System (UMTS) network, or any 3Generation (3G) network. As will be seen hereinbelow, the embodiments of the present patent application for securing a personalized indicium such as a PIN with respect to MCD  will be described regardless of any particular wireless network implementation.",{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0019","num":"0018"},"figref":"FIG. 2","b":["200","110","112","202","208","202","208"]},"Communication between the relay services node  and various application gateways and servers is effectuated using any suitable protocol, e.g., Server Relay Protocol (SRP), preferably over IP links. By way of illustration, remote services server  associated with the enterprise network  (shown in ) communicates with the relay using SRP for effectuating internal data services with respect to the enterprise's mobile subscribers. Likewise, reference numerals  and  refer to external application gateways, such as Internet Service Provider (ISP) or Internet Access Provider (IAP) servers, and other gateways, respectively, which are also interfaced with the relay node  using SRP. A peer-to-peer server  may also be provided in operable connection with the relay node  for handling peer-level messaging between two MCDs using their respective PIN indicia.","Additionally, a database  may be provided in operable connection with the relay node  for handling and managing MCD location information. Preferably, this location information is stored by PIN indicia of the MCDs, which may be programmed into the devices at the time of manufacture or dynamically assigned afterwards, wherein the records maintain a particular device's last known location. A registration server  is operable for providing registration services for MCDs when they are initially activated or when the user re-registers due to moving to a different wireless network coverage area. In one implementation, the location information of registration server  may be programmed into an MCD. When the MCD registers successfully, registration server  is operable to provide the serving relay node's location, whereupon data sessions may be engaged by the MCD. Further, a database  is associated with the registration server  for storing a PIN authentication key provided by the MCD during its registration with the network. As will be seen in greater detail below, the PIN authentication key may be used by the network logic in facilitating the porting of the PIN indicium of an MCD to another MCD via a secure peer-to-peer communication session so that a subscriber may upgrade or otherwise replace his or her handheld device without relinquishing associated service books, provisioning or subscriber profiles, accounting\/billing data, or any PIN-based service such as peer-to-peer messaging.","One or more wireless transport (WT) interfaces are provided as part of relay services node  for connecting with wireless carrier networks that service MCDs. By way of illustration, WT A and WT B communicate with respective packet routers A and B using TCP\/IP links, which route data packets to and from respective wireless packet data service networks, exemplified in  as carrier network A and carrier network B. To facilitate accurate routing, packet routers A, B are provided with PIN-IP mapping tables A and B that are used to route packets over IP networks. When a WT addresses a packet by PIN, the corresponding packet router interrogates the mapping table to look up and retrieve the current IP address for the MCD. In one implementation, the packet routers are operable to update the IP address of the MCD in the mapping tables every time they receive a packet. In another implementation, the IP-PIN mapping tables may be updated as necessary, e.g., when the IP address of an MCD is changed because it is dynamically assigned and may be reclaimed after the MCD has roamed out of a serving area.","Continuing to refer to , registration server , which handles administration and registration services for MCDs, may also be provided with separate WT and packet routing for interfacing with the carrier networks A, B, although not specifically shown. A provisioning system (PRV)  may be co-located or otherwise associated with the relay services node  for setting up and managing various service providers (i.e., carrier networks), subscribers, MCD manufacturers, resellers, and other entities in order to support any number of service and market differentiation requirements. Additionally, the provisioning system  may include logic for provisioning personalized indicia (e.g., PIN assignment and management) with respect to the MCDs. Also, subscriber validation logic may be provided as part of the provisioning system . A service provisioning database  is therefore associated with the provisioning system  for maintaining subscriber\/user profiles, service books, accounting information, et cetera, based on PINs, hard-coded device identifiers, subscriber identifiers, and other indicia.","One skilled in the art should appreciate that the various databases and service logic processing set forth above with respect to the relay network may be realized in suitable hardware, firmware and\/or firmware logic blocks or in combination thereof. Furthermore, as alluded to before, the functionality of the relay network may also be integrated within a wireless carrier network, whereby a \u201cnetwork node\u201d may generally comprise the relay layer functionality as well.",{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0025","num":"0024"},"figref":["FIG. 3","FIG. 3"],"b":["306","304","302","306","304","306","307","308","310","312","314","306","306"]},"The bottom layer (Layer ) of the transport stack  is operable as an interface to the wireless network's packet layer. Layer  handles basic service coordination within the exemplary network environment  shown in . For example, when an MCD roams from one carrier network to another, Layer  verifies that the packets are relayed to the appropriate wireless network and that any packets that are pending from the previous network are rerouted to the current network. The top layer (Layer ) exposes various application interfaces to the services supported on the MCD. The remaining two layers, Layer  and Layer , are responsible for datagram segmentation\/reassembly and security, compression and routing, respectively.","A PIN logic module  provided as part of the MCD's software environment is disposed in operable communication with the transport stack  as well as the OS environment. In one embodiment, the PIN logic module  comprises logic operable to request a PIN indicium from the provisioning network in a dynamic assignment, wherein a temporary PIN may be generated for effectuating pre-registration communication with the network. Alternatively, the PIN logic may include storage means for storing a PIN that is encoded during manufacture. Regardless of the PIN assignment mechanism, once a PIN is persistently associated with an MCD, it is bound to the MCD's hardware device identifier(s) and\/or subscriber identifier(s) such as, e.g., International Mobile station Equipment Identity (IMEI) parameters, International Mobile Subscriber Identity (IMSI) parameters, Electronic Serial Number (ESN) parameters, Mobile Identification Number (MIN) parameters, et cetera, that are associated with MCDs depending on the wireless network technologies and protocols.","Continuing to refer to , a registration and PIN authentication logic module  provided as part of the MCD's software environment is disposed in operable communication with the transport stack  as well as the OS environment for effectuating registration procedures and PIN authentication services (e.g., generation of a PIN authentication key for transmission via a registration request to the network, digital signature generation in a challenge response, et cetera).","A PIN portability logic module , also provided as part of the MCD's software environment, may interface with applications  via TS , wherein suitable application logic includes means operable to initiate a peer-to-peer communication session with another MCD. Additional logic is also associated therewith for negotiating with a network node using at least a portion of the information received from the other MCD for reassigning the other MCD's PIN to itself (i.e., the negotiating MCD). Since PIN assignment and management generally involves mapping at least one of a hard-coded device identifier (such as, e.g., IMEI, ESN, et cetera) or a subscriber identifier (e.g., IMSI) (collectively, \u201cidentifier\u201d) associated with an MCD to a corresponding unique PIN in the network databases, in addition to PIN's association to service provisioning and authentication features, PIN portability is predicated upon disassociating one PIN-to-ID1 mapping and replacing it with another PIN-to-ID2 mapping so that the PIN is bound to a different device (having the identifier ID2). Preferably, such porting transaction is effectuated in a secure manner so that a valid PIN is not transferred to an unauthorized device. For purposes of the present patent application, therefore, the process of transferring a PIN is provided as comprising two parts: (a) transfer of identification, authentication and service-enabling information (collectively, \u201cidentity information\u201d), and (b) claiming or reassignment of the PIN using at least a portion of the identity information (e.g., the authentication information). In addition, proper failsafe features are preferably implemented during the PIN transfer process in order to ensure that regular data transactions do not get redirected to the target device (i.e., the device negotiating for the reassignment of the PIN) until after the transfer is complete and validated. Otherwise, messages could be lost due to decryption failures, for example.",{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0030","num":"0029"},"figref":["FIGS. 4A and 4B","FIG. 4A"],"b":["402","404","406","408","410","412","414","416"]},"Referring now in particular to , an embodiment of PIN reassignment process is shown therein as a flowchart, where the second MCD negotiates with the network node for PIN reassignment. A \u201cChange Key\u201d session is initiated by the second MCD using a suitable command transmitted to the relay network's registration server, wherein the command preferably includes the PIN, the received PIN authentication key (from the first MCD) and a new PIN authentication key generated by the second MCD (block ). The PIN, new PIN authentication key and the second MCD's identifier information (i.e., IMEI, ESN, etc.) are stored in the registration server database (). Upon successful registration by the second MCD (block ), the network may delete the \u201cold\u201d PIN authentication key (i.e, the first MCD's key) and disassociate the PIN\/device ID mapping relating to the first MCD. Thereafter, a new PIN\/device ID mapping is created using the second MCD's ID information, which is transmitted to the provisioning system for updating its database (block ).","Those skilled in the art will recognize upon reference hereto that several additional features, modifications and enhancements may be possible with respect to the PIN portability process set forth hereinabove. For example, the target MCD may not be allowed to drop the old PIN authentication key until it receives appropriate response(s) from the registration server since repeated registration attempts are sometimes necessary. Also, as alluded to earlier, a variety of administrative passwords may be imposed in order to ensure that the person using the MCDs is in fact allowed to use them. Relatedly, the application programming interfaces (APIs) and storage locations for the PIN and password information on the device are preferably provided to be secure (i.e., \u201cunhackable\u201d); otherwise identity theft may become an issue. Further, an enterprise-based information technology (IT) policy may be implemented so as to disable the PIN portability features on a subscriber-by-subscriber basis.",{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0033","num":"0032"},"figref":["FIG. 5","FIG. 5","FIG. 5"],"b":["116","502","116","504","508","514","510","512","504","504","506","114","508","512","514","516"]},"Microprocessor  also interfaces with further device subsystems such as auxiliary input\/output (I\/O) , serial port , display , keyboard , speaker , microphone , random access memory (RAM) , a short-range communications subsystem , and any other device subsystems generally labeled as reference numeral . To control access, a Subscriber Identity Module (SIM) or Removable user Identity Module (RUIM) interface  is also provided in communication with the microprocessor . In one implementation, SIM\/RUIM interface  is operable with a SIM\/RUIM card having a number of key configurations  and other information  such as identification and subscriber-related data.","Operating system software and transport stack software may be embodied in a persistent storage module (i.e., non-volatile storage) such as Flash memory . In one implementation, Flash memory  may be segregated into different areas, e.g., storage area for computer programs  as well as data storage regions such as device state , address book , other personal information manager (PIM) data , and other data storage areas generally labeled as reference numeral . A logic module  is provided for storing a PIN assigned to the MCD, dynamically or otherwise, as well as for generating a PIN authentication key for transmission via registration.
