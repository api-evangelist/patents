The radio bearer admission control entity  determines whether a new radio bearer can be accepted by the system  according to currently available radio resource (such as the currently available radio resource of the serving cell base station clients and ).

C-RAN may require integrated packet scheduling and ICI solutions to optimise the benefits of the system architecture shown in .","In order to solve the problem of ICI in a LTE system, the present disclosure provides a method involving allocating resources to users in adjacent cells of a cell cluster utilising a resource restriction strategy based on allocation priorities assigned to each cell. The solution comprises the following steps: (a) classifying users in each of adjacent cells in a cellular communication network into cell edge users and cell centre users; (b) determining allocation priorities for each of the adjacent cells; and (c) allocating resources to the users in each of the adjacent cells based on the allocation priorities, except that resources allocated to cell edge users in one of the adjacent cells are restricted from use by other adjacent cells having lower allocation priorities.","The method may be applied to any C-RAN network. Under practical conditions the method reduces or eliminates ICI whilst also providing good and fair packet scheduling within each cell of a cell cluster. The method may be explained with reference to a cluster comprising C cells with centralized control in which all available radio resource blocks (RBs) are used at least once (e.g., C=3 cells) during a configured allocation period\/interval. The cluster of 3 cells shown in  is merely an example but not intended as limiting on the method of the disclosure. Persons skilled in the art will readily appreciate and understand that the number of cells in each cluster is set by a planning and optimization team within a mobile network operator.","Step (a) may be carried out based on reference signal strengths of each of the users as follows. For each user in a cell, the eNodeB with the greatest pilot signal is the serving cell. For each transmit time interval (TTI) or a configured window interval period P, users in a cell cluster are divided into CC users or CE users based on signal-to-interference-noise-ratio (SINR) reported by the users. For example, if the pilot signal (or SINR) of a serving cell reported by a user A is greater than pilot signal strengths (or SINR) of other cells by a threshold amount delta \u0394 (which can be set by the mobile network operator or according to an algorithm), the cell coordination scheduler  of the base station server  may consider the user A as a CC user. On the other hand, if the pilot signal (or SINR) of a serving cell reported by a user B is not greater than pilot signal strengths (or SINR) of other cells by the threshold amount delta \u0394, the cell coordination scheduler  of the base station server  may consider the user B as a CE user.","In an alternative example, when another user C respectively receives 2 or more pilot signals from 2 or more cells with nearly equal signal strength, the cell coordination scheduler  of the base station server  may consider this user C as a CE user.",{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0059","num":"0058"},"figref":["FIG. 6","FIG. 6"],"b":["60","1","2","3","1","2","3","1","2","3","1","2","3","60"]},"As shown in , the eNodeBs in the cluster of 3 cells are communicatively connected to the base station server  and are also centrally controlled by the base station server .  is an exemplary schematic illustrating radio resource blocks respectively allocated to CE UEs in cells C, C, C in the cluster . There are 50 radio resource blocks RB, RB, . . . , RB in a configured bandwidth, for example 100 MHz. The base station clients , and are deployed respectively at antenna locations A, A and A in , and base station clients , and correspond to BBUs which are all managed by the same cell coordination scheduler . For example, the BBUs connected to the base station clients , and may first receive channel quality metrics such as Channel Quality Indicator (CQI) and Reference Signal Receive Power (RSRP) of all UEs from the base station clients , , , and then report all channel quality metrics of all UEs in the cluster  to the cell coordination scheduler .","The resource allocation to users in adjacent cells utilising a restriction strategy based on allocation priorities assigned to each cell shown in  is explained below with reference to the cluster  shown in . It is assumed that step (a) noted above has been executed previously. The determination of CC UEs and CE UEs in each cell in the cluster  may be performed with a configured window interval period P longer than a resource allocation period.","After performance of step (a) the base station server  can allocate RBs to CC UE(s) and CE UE(s) in each cell of the cluster  consecutively. In operation, the BBU corresponding to the cells C, C, C can allocate resource blocks to CC UEs and CE UEs in cells C, C, C consecutively during the resource allocation period. In an alternative embodiment, the cell coordination scheduler  of the base station server  may allocate resource blocks to CC UEs and CE UEs in cells C, C, C simultaneously during the resource allocation period.","The cell coordination scheduler  or the BBU corresponding to the cells C, C and C may perform steps (b) and (c) together as explained below. First, the cell coordination scheduler  or the relevant BBU determines allocation priorities for each of the adjacent cells. In  the allocation priority is: C has a highest allocation priority followed by C and C. The relevant BBU or the cell coordination scheduler  then allocates RBs to the highest allocation priority cell C. Radio resource blocks RB corresponding to label C shown in  are the resource blocks allocated to the CE UEs in the cell C. The cell C has a lower allocation priority than that of cell C but higher than that of cell C. Therefore, when the resource blocks are allocated to the CE UEs in the cell C, the resource blocks allocated to the cell C are restricted resource blocks. In other words, the CE UEs in the cell C will not be allocated with the resource blocks already allocated to the CE UEs in the cell C. Similarly, when the resource blocks are allocated to the CE UEs in the cell C, the resource blocks allocated to the cells C and C are restricted resource blocks. The resource blocks allocated to the cell C are the ones with sectioned pattern such as radio resource block RB. Therefore, the CE UEs in the cell C will not be allocated with the resource blocks already allocated to the cells C and C. Finally, in the present resource allocation period, the CE UEs in the cell C are allocated with radio resource blocks with checked patterns such as radio resource block RB.","After steps (b) and (c), the cell coordination scheduler  or the BBU changes the allocation priorities of cells C, C, C in the cluster . The change may be, for example, rotating the allocation priority ranks of cells C, C, C in the cluster . In an alternative embodiment, the change may be performed along with a resource allocation algorithm such that the UE with metrics corresponding to a longer waiting period or more urgent downlink data transmission can be assigned a higher allocation priority.","The base station server  can be considered as a Digital Unit (DU) or a DU cloud, which controls all cells within a cluster. The base station server  collects feedback\/report information from users\/UEs and decides how to allocate radio resources to each UE. Resource block (RB) in the present disclosure is the same as PRB (Physical RB or a pair of RB). In all embodiments of the present disclosure, CC UEs in each cell may use radio resource block already allocated to CE UE in other cells.","The cell coordination scheduler  or the BBU corresponding to cells in a cluster may allocate the RBs to CC UEs and CE UEs according to a packet scheduling algorithm, which performs an intra-cell resource allocation, for example, Max-rate (MR), Proportional Fair (PF), Modified-Largest Weighted Delay First (M-LWDF) Algorithm, Exponential Rule Algorithm (EXP), Quality-Driven Scheduling (Q-DS) Algorithm, Robust and QoS-Driven Scheduling (RQ-DS).","For example, a PF algorithm can be modified as an intra-cell radio resource algorithm C for allocating RBs to CC users and CE users in each cell of a cluster according to the following mathematical expressions (1),

Then, the radio resource block assigned to the CE UE in the sector J with higher resource allocation priority rank will be added into a list of restricted radio resource block for the sector Q, which is considered by the coordination scheduler  or the BBU  as an interfering sector of the sector J.","For example, the cell coordination scheduler  or the BBU  determines in advance that the cell allocation priority in the configured 9-sector cluster during the priority allocation period G is: Cell_A>Cell_B>Cell_C. Also, in this example, the sector allocation priority ranks in the cell Cell_A is: A_1>A_2>A_3. Then, the cell coordination scheduler  or the BBU  performs an intra-cell radio resource block allocation for sector A_1 of the cell Cell_A for the present allocation period T, and allocates a radio resource block L to a CE UE U1. The cell coordination scheduler  or the BBU  also determines that the sector B_3 of the cell Cell_B and the sector C_2 of the cell Cell_C are interfering sectors to the CE UE U1, and thus updates the radio resource block L in lists of restricted radio resource block respectively for the sector B_3 and the sector C_2. When the cell coordination scheduler  or the BBU  performs intra-cell radio resource allocation with radio resource restriction in the sector B_3 and the sector C_2, both a CE UE U_2 in the sector B_3 or a CE UE U_3 in the sector C_2 are restricted from being allocated the radio resource block L as it is recorded in the lists of restricted radio resource blocks respectively of the sector B_3 and the sector C_2. However any CC UE in the interfering sectors such as the sector C_2 and the sector B_3 is not blocked from being allocated the radio resource block L.","Similar procedures will be executed consecutively for all sectors in the cluster such that the \u201cintra-cell radio resource allocation with restricted radio resource blocks\u201d procedure is performed one sector after another until UEs in all sectors in the cluster have been allocated resources. For example, during the priority allocation period G, the cell coordination scheduler  or the BBU  firstly performs the \u201cintra-cell radio resource allocation with radio resource blocks restriction\u201d procedure in the cell Cell_A (which has the cell allocation priority of 1). The \u201cintra-cell radio resource allocation with radio resource blocks restriction\u201d procedures are performed consecutively on the sectors A_1, A_2 and A_3, which respectively have sector allocation priority rank of 1, 2 and 3 in the cell Cell_A. Then, the cell coordination scheduler  or the BBU  continues to perform the \u201cintra-cell radio resource allocation with radio resource blocks restriction\u201d procedure in the cell Cell_B and Cell_C consecutively, for the same priority allocation period G. Therefore, the sequence of performing \u201cintra-cell radio resource allocation with radio resource blocks restriction\u201d is: sector A_1\u2192sector A_2\u2192sector A_3->sector B_1\u2192sector B_2\u2192sector B_3\u2192sector C_1\u2192sector C_2\u2192sector C_3.","Differences between the first exemplary embodiment and the second exemplary embodiment are: there is a global list of restricted radio resource blocks maintained in the cluster in the first exemplary embodiment; there will be a separate list of restricted radio resource blocks maintained for each sector in the second exemplary embodiment; only interfering sector will have its list of restricted radio resource blocks updated in the second exemplary embodiment.","In step S, the coordination scheduler  or the BBU  changes the cell allocation priorities of cells and the sector allocation priorities of sectors in each cell in the cluster for the next resource allocation period T+1, after the present resource allocation period T, until the present priority allocation period G expires. The basic unit of the allocation period can be, for example, a TTI. The change of the allocation priority ranks of cells in the cluster can be, for example, (a) randomly selected; (b) selected by round-robin or (c) configured by another algorithm to improve the fairness of resource allocation to UEs in different cells of the configured cluster. The resource priority allocation period T can be, for example, 50 TTIs.",{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0122","num":"0121"},"figref":["FIG. 14","FIG. 14","FIG. 9","FIG. 14"],"b":"133"},"In step S in , the cell coordination scheduler  or the BBU  of the base station server  allocates radio resource blocks in a sector with sector allocation priority S in a cell with cell allocation priority K according to the sector's own list of restricted radio resource blocks to CE UE in the configured cluster.

Step S is executed after the step S.","In step S, the cell coordination scheduler  or the BBU  determines to update the radio resource block L to a list of\/lists of restricted resource block for interferer sectors in the configured cluster for the present allocation period. The method for determining which sector is an interferer sector for the current sector depends upon the reported reference signal strengths of the current cell and the neighbouring cell of a CE UE in the current cell. For example, the reported reference signal strength refers to pilot signal strength or reference signal strength detected by each UE. When the reference signal strength (or SINR) of a serving cell reported by a CE UE C is not greater than pilot signal strengths (or SINR) of a neighbouring cell by a threshold amount sigma \u03c3 (which can be set by the mobile network operator or according to an algorithm), the coordination scheduler  or the BBU  of the base station server  determines a sector, closest to the current sector, in the neighbouring cell as an interferer sector for the CE UE C. The configured threshold amount sigma \u03c3 may be 1 dB, 5 dB or 10 dB for example. Additionally, in the step S, when the CE UE C is allocated with the radio resource block L, the radio resource block L is added by the cell coordination scheduler  or the BBU  into the interferer sector's own list of restricted radio resource blocks.","In step S, the cell coordination scheduler  or the BBU  determines to update the amount of data to be transmitted to the UE which is just allocated with the radio resource block L.

In the step S, when the cell coordination scheduler  or the BBU  determines a UE in the scheduling list in the current sector no longer needs to receive downlink data, the cell coordination scheduler  or the BBU  can discard the UE from the scheduling list of UEs of the current sector. The step S is an optional step.","In step S, the cell coordination scheduler  or the BBU  determines whether any UE left in the scheduling list of UEs for the radio resource block L. When it is determined that there is at least one UE left in the scheduling list of UEs for the radio resource block L, the step S is executed after the step S. When it is determined that there is no more UE left in the scheduling list of UEs for the radio resource block L, the step S is executed after the step S.","In step S, the cell coordination scheduler  or the BBU  updates the value of L by incrementing the value of L by one unit. In step S, the cell coordination scheduler  or the BBU  determines whether the updated value of L is equal to Lmax, which refers to the maximum number of radio resource blocks configured for the current sector. When it is determined that the updated value of L is not equal to Lmax there is still at least one radio resource block, in the current sector, which has not been allocated resources; then, step S is executed after the step S. On the other hand, when it is determined that the updated value of L is equal to Lmax, the intra-cell radio resource allocation in the current sector is completed. The cell coordination scheduler  or the BBU  continues to perform an intra-cell radio resource allocation in the next sector or a first cell in the cluster for the next allocation period.","In a large scale implementation, when the number of cells controlled by the base station server  is large, the number of cells can be divided into several clusters as needed for ICI coordination. When there are multiple clusters in the wireless communication system, each cluster can share information with other clusters to avoid ICI. The concept of the solution for multi-cluster ICI coordination can be explained below.","Apart from the base station server  maintaining a \u201clist of restricted radio resource blocks\u201d for each sector or each cell or the cluster, the cell coordination scheduler  of the base station server  can also maintain a \u201clist of neighbouring and interfering cells\u201d for each cell or each sector in the cluster. Also, the cell coordination scheduler  can maintain a \u201clist of neighbouring cells of nearby clusters\u201d for each cluster in the wireless communication system. For example, in a Cluster A, Cell 3 and 4 are neighbors of Cluster B; Cells 4, 5, 6 are neighbors with Cluster C. After the proposed method of allocating radio resource with restricted radio resource blocks is performed according to the steps of the first or the second exemplary embodiment, the information about radio resource blocks allocated to CE UEs for Cell 3 and 4 will be transmitted to the cluster scheduler\/cell coordination scheduler  responsible for radio resource allocation in Cluster B.","According to the cluster priority (or the cell priority), a cluster with lower cluster allocation priority will compare its radio resource block allocations with cells of the neighboring cluster. When there is a conflict on radio resource block allocation the cell coordination scheduler  can determine that the cluster with lower priority withdraws the allocation of the conflicted CE radio resource blocks. For example. Cluster A has higher cluster allocation priority than Cluster B. When the Cluster B has Cells 6 and 7 neighboring with Cluster A, and if a same radio resource block was assigned in these two cells, the radio resource block allocation of the CE UE in the Cluster B will be withheld. As a result, the interference around the border of clusters is avoided.",{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0142","num":"0141"},"figref":"FIG. 8","sup":"th "},{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0143","num":"0142"},"tables":{"@attributes":{"id":"TABLE-US-00002","num":"00002"},"table":{"@attributes":{"frame":"none","colsep":"0","rowsep":"0"},"tgroup":[{"@attributes":{"align":"left","colsep":"0","rowsep":"0","cols":"1"},"colspec":{"@attributes":{"colname":"1","colwidth":"217pt","align":"center"}},"thead":{"row":{"entry":"TABLE II"}},"tbody":{"@attributes":{"valign":"top"},"row":[{"entry":{"@attributes":{"namest":"1","nameend":"1","align":"center","rowsep":"1"}}},{"entry":"Simulation Parameters for 3-Sector Network Layout"}]}},{"@attributes":{"align":"left","colsep":"0","rowsep":"0","cols":"3"},"colspec":[{"@attributes":{"colname":"1","colwidth":"119pt","align":"left"}},{"@attributes":{"colname":"2","colwidth":"91pt","align":"center"}},{"@attributes":{"colname":"3","colwidth":"7pt","align":"center"}}],"tbody":{"@attributes":{"valign":"top"},"row":[{"entry":["Parameter","Value"]},{"entry":{"@attributes":{"namest":"1","nameend":"3","align":"center","rowsep":"1"}}}]}},{"@attributes":{"align":"left","colsep":"0","rowsep":"0","cols":"2"},"colspec":[{"@attributes":{"colname":"1","colwidth":"119pt","align":"left"}},{"@attributes":{"colname":"2","colwidth":"98pt","align":"center"}}],"tbody":{"@attributes":{"valign":"top"},"row":{"entry":["Number of sectors","3 (Three sector cluster)"]}}},{"@attributes":{"align":"left","colsep":"0","rowsep":"0","cols":"3"},"colspec":[{"@attributes":{"colname":"1","colwidth":"119pt","align":"left"}},{"@attributes":{"colname":"2","colwidth":"56pt","align":"right"}},{"@attributes":{"colname":"3","colwidth":"42pt","align":"left"}}],"tbody":{"@attributes":{"valign":"top"},"row":[{"entry":["Cell radius","500","m"]},{"entry":["Bandwidth","10","MHz"]},{"entry":["Tx power","46","dBm"]}]}},{"@attributes":{"align":"left","colsep":"0","rowsep":"0","cols":"2"},"colspec":[{"@attributes":{"colname":"1","colwidth":"119pt","align":"left"}},{"@attributes":{"colname":"2","colwidth":"98pt","align":"center"}}],"tbody":{"@attributes":{"valign":"top"},"row":[{"entry":["Transmission mode","SISO"]},{"entry":["Frame Structure","FDD"]},{"entry":["HARQ","OFF"]},{"entry":["Number of UEs per Cell","100"]},{"entry":["UE Mobility model","Random Direction TSC"]}]}},{"@attributes":{"align":"left","colsep":"0","rowsep":"0","cols":"3"},"colspec":[{"@attributes":{"colname":"1","colwidth":"119pt","align":"left"}},{"@attributes":{"colname":"2","colwidth":"56pt","align":"right"}},{"@attributes":{"colname":"3","colwidth":"42pt","align":"left"}}],"tbody":{"@attributes":{"valign":"top"},"row":{"entry":["UE speed","3","km\/h"]}}},{"@attributes":{"align":"left","colsep":"0","rowsep":"0","cols":"2"},"colspec":[{"@attributes":{"colname":"1","colwidth":"119pt","align":"left"}},{"@attributes":{"colname":"2","colwidth":"98pt","align":"center"}}],"tbody":{"@attributes":{"valign":"top"},"row":[{"entry":["Handover","OFF"]},{"entry":["Application","Video 128 Kbps"]}]}},{"@attributes":{"align":"left","colsep":"0","rowsep":"0","cols":"3"},"colspec":[{"@attributes":{"colname":"1","colwidth":"119pt","align":"left"}},{"@attributes":{"colname":"2","colwidth":"56pt","align":"right"}},{"@attributes":{"colname":"3","colwidth":"42pt","align":"left"}}],"tbody":{"@attributes":{"valign":"top"},"row":{"entry":["Max Delay (QoS parameter for VIDEO)","0.3","s"]}}},{"@attributes":{"align":"left","colsep":"0","rowsep":"0","cols":"2"},"colspec":[{"@attributes":{"colname":"1","colwidth":"119pt","align":"left"}},{"@attributes":{"colname":"2","colwidth":"98pt","align":"center"}}],"tbody":{"@attributes":{"valign":"top"},"row":{"entry":["Scheduler","MLWDF"]}}},{"@attributes":{"align":"left","colsep":"0","rowsep":"0","cols":"3"},"colspec":[{"@attributes":{"colname":"1","colwidth":"119pt","align":"left"}},{"@attributes":{"colname":"2","colwidth":"56pt","align":"right"}},{"@attributes":{"colname":"3","colwidth":"42pt","align":"left"}}],"tbody":{"@attributes":{"valign":"top"},"row":[{"entry":["Simulation duration","100","s"]},{"entry":{"@attributes":{"namest":"1","nameend":"3","align":"center","rowsep":"1"}}}]}}]}}},"Table III illustrates the performance gain obtained using centralised resource allocation based on C-RAN in the 3-sector cluster and the resource restriction strategy explained in the first exemplary embodiment above.
