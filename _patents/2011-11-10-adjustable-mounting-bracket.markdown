title: Adjustable mounting bracket
abstract: A bracket is provided for mounting conduit clamps or pipe clamps to the face of the bracket. The height of the bracket can be adjusted by removing pins that are attached to mounting bracket feet and mounting bracket arms. Multiple holes may be formed in the mounting bracket arm and mounting bracket feet to allow for various alignments of the bracket arms, which will vary the height of the bracket. The height is adjusted through a pair of four-bar linkages that enable a linear motion of the bracket face. The bracket may have a footprint that is smaller than conventional adjustable mounting brackets.

Both require a large footprint for the bracket. There is a need for an amounting bracket for mounting pipe or conduit clamps that is adjustable in height with a minimal footprint.","Conventional mounting brackets yield disadvantages addressed by various exemplary embodiments of the present invention. In particular, various exemplary embodiments provide an adjustable mounting bracket comprises a bracket face having a height that is adjustable relative to a mounting surface; a long bracing bracket having a first long bracing bracket end pivotably attached to each end of the bracket face; a short bracing bracket having a first short bracing bracket end pivotably attached to a central region of the long bracing bracket; and one or more holes at a second short bracing bracket end, the one or more holes adapted to permit the short bracing bracket to pivot about the second short bracing bracket end, the one or more holes further adapted to fix the position of the short bracing bracket on a bracket mount.","According to another aspect in the exemplary embodiments, an adjustable mounting bracket comprises a bracket face having a height that is adjustable relative to a mounting surface; a long bracing bracket having a first long bracing bracket end pivotably attached to each end of the bracket face; a bearing block pivotably attached to a second long bracing bracket end; a bearing sleeve disposed in a hole through the bearing block; a bearing travel bar disposed to permit travel of the bearing block there along when the height of the bracket face is adjusted; a short bracing bracket having a first short bracing bracket end pivotably attached to a central region of the long bracing bracket; one or more holes at a second short bracing bracket end, the one or more holes adapted to permit the short bracing bracket to pivot about the second short bracing bracket end, the one or more holes further adapted to fix the position of the short bracing bracket on a bracket mount.","According to a further aspect in the exemplary embodiments, a method for adjustably securing one or more tubular members to a bracket comprises attaching at least one clamp onto a bracket face; adjusting the height of the bracket face; and securing the one or more tubular members to the at least one clamp, wherein the bracket comprises a bracket face having a height that is adjustable relative to a mounting surface; a long bracing bracket having a first long bracing bracket end pivotably attached to each end of the bracket face; a short bracing bracket having a first short bracing bracket end pivotably attached to a central region of the long bracing bracket; and one or more holes at a second short bracing bracket end, the one or more holes adapted to permit the short bracing bracket to pivot about the second short bracing bracket end, the one or more holes further adapted to fix the position of the short bracing bracket on a bracket mount.","The above and other features described for exemplary embodiments, including various novel details of construction and combinations of parts, will now be more particularly described with reference to the accompanying drawings and pointed out in the claims. The particular assembly in these embodiments is shown by way of illustration only and not as a limitation to the claims. The principles and features of this invention may be employed in various and numerous embodiments without departing from the scope of the invention.","In the following detailed description of exemplary embodiments of the invention, reference is made to the accompanying drawings that form a part hereof, and in which is shown by way of illustration specific exemplary embodiments in which the invention may be practiced. These embodiments are described in sufficient detail to enable those skilled in the art to practice the invention.","Other embodiments may be utilized, and logical, mechanical, and other changes may be made without departing from the spirit or scope of the present invention. The following detailed description is, therefore, not to be taken in a limiting sense, and the scope of the present invention is defined only by the appended claims.","Broadly, the current invention provides a bracket that permits the mounting of conduit clamps or pipe clamps to the face of the bracket. The height of the bracket can be adjusted by removing pins that are attached to mounting bracket feet and mounting bracket arms.","Multiple holes may be formed in the mounting bracket arm and mounting bracket feet to allow for various alignments of the bracket arms, which will vary the height of the bracket. The height is adjusted through two four-bar linkages that allow for a linear motion of the bracket face. The bracket of the current invention may have a footprint that is smaller than conventional adjustable mounting brackets.","Referring now to the drawings, and more particularly to , a mounting bracket  may include a bracket face  that is adjustable in height by a four-bar linkage . A first end of a long bracing bracket  may pivotably attach to each side of each end of the bracket face . A clevis pin , for example, may be used to provide the pivoting attachment between the long bracing bracket  and the bracket face . A second, opposite end of the long bracing bracket  may pivotably attach to a bearing block . A shoulder screw , for example, may be used to provide the pivoting attachment between the long bracing bracket  and the bearing block .","A proximal end of a short bracing bracket  may pivotably attach to a central section  of each of the long bracing brackets . Clevis pins  may be used to provide the pivoting attachment between the short bracing bracket  and the long bracing bracket . An opposite distal end of the short bracing bracket  may include a plurality of mounting holes  and .","The mounting hole  may be used to pivotably attach the short bracing bracket  to a mount  with, for example, a short bracing bracket clevis pin . The mounting holes  may include two mounting holes adapted to receive a pin . The mount  may include a plurality of holes  that align with the mounting holes  in the short bracing bracket  as the short bracing bracket  is pivoted about the short bracing bracket clevis pin . The pin  may adjust the angle of the short bracing bracket  relative to a mounting surface , thereby adjusting the height, relative to the mounting surface , of the bracket face .","The bearing block  may be disposed to move along the mounting surface  as the height of the bracket face  is changed. However, surface irregularities in the mounting surface  may hinder movement of the bearing block . In some embodiments, the bearing block  may have a bearing sleeve . Typically, the bearing sleeve  may be press fit into a hole in the bearing block . First and second clamps ,  may support a bearing travel bar  off from the mounting surface . The bearing block  may travel along the bearing travel bar , thereby permitting smooth height adjustment of the bracket face .","Referring now to , the mounting bracket  may be mounted on a panel sub-assembly . The pins  may be affixed to the panel sub-assembly  via a wire  connected to a tab  secured to the mounting surface  by a nut , for example, to keep the pins  readily available while the height of the bracket face  is adjusted.","The bracket face  may be adapted to hold a plurality of conduit clamps or pipe clamps  as shown in . In some embodiments, the bracket face  may have slot  cut therein to accept bolts  of the conduit or pipe clamps . The slot  may permit an operator to loosen nuts  on the bolts  to permit the clamp  to slide lengthwise along the slot .","While the above describes the bracket  having a set of bracing brackets (short bracing bracket  and long bracing bracket ) on each side of the bracket face , in some embodiments, a single set of bracing brackets may be used to provide a similar adjustment mechanism as is obtained with two sets of bracing brackets.","While certain features of the embodiments of the invention have been illustrated as described herein, many modifications, substitutions, changes and equivalents will now occur to those skilled in the art. It is, therefore, to be understood that the appended claims are intended to cover all such modifications and changes as fall within the true spirit of the embodiments."],"BRFSUM":[{},{}],"brief-description-of-drawings":[{},{}],"description-of-drawings":{"heading":"BRIEF DESCRIPTION OF THE DRAWINGS","p":["These and various other features and aspects of various exemplary embodiments will be readily understood with reference to the following detailed description taken in conjunction with the accompanying drawings, in which like or similar numbers are used throughout, and in which:",{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0011","num":"0010"},"figref":"FIG. 1"},{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0012","num":"0011"},"figref":"FIG. 2"},{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0013","num":"0012"},"figref":"FIG. 3","b":["3","3"]},{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0014","num":"0013"},"figref":"FIG. 4"},{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0015","num":"0014"},"figref":"FIG. 5"},{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0016","num":"0015"},"figref":"FIG. 6"},{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0017","num":"0016"},"figref":"FIG. 7","b":["7","7"]},{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0018","num":"0017"},"figref":"FIG. 8","b":["8","8"]},{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0019","num":"0018"},"figref":"FIG. 9","b":"9"},{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0020","num":"0019"},"figref":"FIG. 10"},{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0021","num":"0020"},"figref":"FIG. 11"},{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0022","num":"0021"},"figref":"FIG. 12"}]},"DETDESC":[{},{}]}
