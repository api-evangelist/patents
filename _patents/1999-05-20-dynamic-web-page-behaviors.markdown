title: Dynamic web page behaviors
abstract: A method and system for rendering dynamic web page images on a display is disclosed. Code is encapsulated in an external behavior component for affecting the behavior of elements inserted into an HTML document. A simple reference is attached to the element in the document to associate the element with the external behavior component. When the document is provided to a renderer and the renderer parses the element in the document, the renderer accesses the external component to modify a behavior of the page image. Multiple documents can reuse external behavior components, and an element can be associated with multiple external behavior components. The associations between elements and external behavior components may be maintained in cascading style sheets, inline with the elements, and in various formats.

{"@attributes":{"id":"description"},"BRFSUM":[{},{}],"heading":["TECHNICAL FIELD","BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION","SUMMARY OF THE INVENTION","DETAILED DESCRIPTION OF THE PREFERRED EMBODIMENT","Exemplary Operating Environment"],"p":["The invention relates generally to computer systems, and more particularly to the creation and subsequent rendering of interactive web pages on a computer system.","Browsers display web pages by interpreting Hypertext Markup Language (HTML), which includes sets of tags nested within other sets of tags around content to render. To assist the authors and designers in creating such web pages, a recent development is the use of cascading style sheets, via which the author or designer may globally specify styles for selected page elements, including appearance information such as color and point sizes of text, page margins, and leading (spacing between lines). A style sheet is essentially a template that controls the formatting of HTML tags on a page, and can be linked to a page or embedded in a page. Style sheets separate the formatting information from the actual content on HTML pages, whereby it has become easier for authors and designers to design and revise pages.","An improvement to how a web page may be made to appear to a viewer is Dynamic HTML (DHTML), which enhances the appearance of a page's elements by adding effects thereto. Dynamic HTML (DHTML) also allows an HTML document to become interactive, which is accomplished by allowing HTML elements or tags within the HTML document to be programmable, such that script can change the content and attributes of the HTML page. For example, a script on the page may allow a list to be expanded or collapsed in response to a mouse click, without needing to retrieve a different HTML document from the server. The script resides on the same page as the other elements, even when the script is obtained from a separate file, since that script is particular to the page and is essentially imported into the page when the HTML document is loaded.","In essence, three job disciplines are involved in creating a DHTML page, i.e., a content provider, designer, and engineer. The content provider is the author of the content of the document, while the designer decides on the look and feel of the document, and typically adds any formatting information. The engineer adds the dynamic functionality using script. In many situations, these jobs are not performed by one highly-skilled person, but by three separate individuals of different skill levels, as many authors and designers are uncomfortable with programming. This, along with the fact that the script resides on the same page as the other elements, makes DHTML expensive and fragile to use in web documents. More particularly, as the engineer applies one or more scripts to every page, the process becomes expensive and error prone, as subsequent content changes by the author or designer may affect the script. At the same time, the engineer may affect the layout or content of the document when adding the script to the page. Even for those authors and designers who are comfortable with programming concepts and with using script to add dynamic functionality to a document, having the script and content in the same file makes the page creation and maintenance processes relatively slow and difficult to manage.","Briefly, the present invention provides a method and system for adding script-like behavior to an element via a component that is external to the page. An external behavior is created for affecting the behavior of elements inserted into an HTML document by encapsulating code in an external behavior component, preferably a COM (component object model) object. A designer or the like adds simple tags to the document to associate the external behavior component with selected elements, thereby separating script from content. These associations between elements and external behavior components may be maintained in cascading style sheets, inline with the elements, and in various formats.","When the document is provided to a renderer and the renderer parses the element in the document, the renderer accesses the associated external component to modify a behavior of the page image. For example, the properties or location of a displayed element associated with the external behavior component may be changed on an event such as a mouseover event. An external behavior component can provide mask behavior to control the format and type of user data input. Another external behavior component can draw on the image when accessed by the renderer.","Multiple documents can reuse external behavior components, enabling, for example, an entire web site to share a common behavior. An element can be associated with multiple external behavior components to provide multiple effects, such as changing color and expanding a list when clicked by a user.","Other advantages will become apparent from the following detailed description when taken in conjunction with the drawings, in which:",{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0016","num":"0015"},"figref":"FIG. 1"},"With reference to , an exemplary system for implementing the invention includes a general purpose computing device in the form of a conventional personal computer  or the like, including a processing unit , a system memory , and a system bus  that couples various system components including the system memory to the processing unit . The system bus  may be any of several types of bus structures including a memory bus or memory controller, a peripheral bus, and a local bus using any of a variety of bus architectures. The system memory includes read-only memory (ROM)  and random access memory (RAM) . A basic input\/output system  (BIOS), containing the basic routines that help to transfer information between elements within the personal computer , such as during start-up, is stored in ROM . The personal computer  may further include a hard disk drive  for reading from and writing to a hard disk, not shown, a magnetic disk drive  for reading from or writing to a removable magnetic disk , and an optical disk drive  for reading from or writing to a removable optical disk  such as a CD-ROM or other optical media. The hard disk drive , magnetic disk drive , and optical disk drive  are connected to the system bus  by a hard disk drive interface , a magnetic disk drive interface , and an optical drive interface , respectively. The drives and their associated computer-readable media provide non-volatile storage of computer readable instructions, data structures, program modules and other data for the personal computer . Although the exemplary environment described herein employs a hard disk, a removable magnetic disk  and a removable optical disk , it should be appreciated by those skilled in the art that other types of computer readable media which can store data that is accessible by a computer, such as magnetic cassettes, flash memory cards, digital video disks, Bernoulli cartridges, random access memories (RAMs), read-only memories (ROMs) and the like may also be used in the exemplary operating environment.","A number of program modules may be stored on the hard disk, magnetic disk , optical disk , ROM  or RAM , including an operating system  (preferably Windows NT), one or more application programs , other program modules  and program data . A user may enter commands and information into the personal computer  through input devices such as a keyboard  and pointing device . Other input devices (not shown) may include a microphone, joystick, game pad, satellite dish, scanner or the like. These and other input devices are often connected to the processing unit  through a serial port interface  that is coupled to the system bus, but may be connected by other interfaces, such as a parallel port, game port or universal serial bus (USB). A monitor  or other type of display device is also connected to the system bus  via an interface, such as a video adapter . In addition to the monitor , personal computers typically include other peripheral output devices (not shown), such as speakers and printers.","The personal computer  may operate in a networked environment using logical connections to one or more remote computers, such as a remote computer . The remote computer  may be another personal computer, a server, a router, a network PC, a peer device or other common network node, and typically includes many or all of the elements described above relative to the personal computer , although only a memory storage device  has been illustrated in . The logical connections depicted in  include a local area network (LAN)  and a wide area network (WAN) . Such networking environments are commonplace in offices, enterprise-wide computer networks, Intranets and the Internet.","When used in a LAN networking environment, the personal computer  is connected to the local network  through a network interface or adapter . When used in a WAN networking environment, the personal computer  typically includes a modem  or other means for establishing communications over the wide area network , such as the Internet. The modem , which may be internal or external, is connected to the system bus  via the serial port interface . In a networked environment, program modules depicted relative to the personal computer , or portions thereof, may be stored in the remote memory storage device. It will be appreciated that the network connections shown are exemplary and other means of establishing a communications link between the computers may be used.","DHTML Behaviors","DHTML behaviors (e.g., , ) are components that encapsulate specific functionality or behavior on a page, but are external to the page. DHTML behavior components are preferably COM objects, although behavior components are typically implemented using script and HTML. The interfaces for DHTML behavior components are few, simple, and robust, as described below.","In general, an HTML document, or page, may be considered a document tree, in that elements are contained by other elements in a hierarchical manner. As shown in , an exemplary HTML document tree  shows elements -as nodes of the tree, and a behavior  attached to one of the elements . Indeed, a renderer (browser)  logically constructs such a tree when provided with a page, (e.g., of ), whereby attributes and the like may be applied appropriately to elements as events are received, i.e., the events bubble up through the tree as described below.","When applied to a standard HTML element on a page, a behavior component  enhances that element's default behavior. For example, a behavior component can be written to toggle the display property of an element's children on a mouse click. When such a behavior component  is applied to a standard element on a page, the behavior component  enhances the unordered list's default behavior to expand and collapse when clicked. Another behavior component (e.g., , of ) can incrementally set the position of an element from a start point to an end point on the screen, whereby if such a behavior component , is applied to an image element, the otherwise statically positioned image \u201cflies\u201d across the screen.","In accordance with one aspect of the invention and as represented in , behavior components -are external components with respect to the pages , , and thus separate script from content. As a result, improved manageability of pages , is provided. Moreover, because the behavior components -are encapsulated components, the code of a behavior component may be reused across multiple pages. For example, as represented in , the page includes elements that reference and (when parsed by an HTML renderer ) use two external behavior components and , while the page has elements that also use (another instance) of the behavior component along with the external behavior component . The renderer  outputs and\/or modifies an outputted image based on the attached behaviors. A preferred renderer  is Microsoft Corporation's Internet Explorer 5.0 rendering engine (mshtml.dll), which, in addition to being able to handle behavior components, provides data manipulation, formatting, and content changes without dependency on a Web server. With such an engine, enhanced programmatic access and control is provided, the location of objects and images can be precisely specified, and HTML tags, style sheets, text, tables, and ActiveX objects can be handled without requiring interaction with a Web server.","To use a behavior component (e.g., , of ), an engineer or the like first develops the behavior component , using script or a language such as C++ to develop a binary file. More particularly, DHTML behavior components can be written in script using script component technology to provide a safe extensibility mechanism for those that are familiar with script and the Dynamic HTML Object Model. A utility or the like converts the script to a COM object. Behavior components created in C++ use an OBJECT tag syntax (described below) to instantiate, and may be directed to a specific platform, for example, to access Win32 Application Programming Interfaces (APIs) and the interfaces for implementing DHTML behavior components. Note that a number of default behaviors may be developed and, for example, provided with a browser, whether the browser is a stand-alone application or integrated with an operating system, e.g., Internet Explorer.","In accordance with one aspect of the invention, once developed, a page designer or the like may then use the declarative HTML tag syntax that is already familiar to the designer in order to refer to the behavior component. To this end, the designer includes a behavior attribute, essentially a reference to the behavior component, such as in an embedded style in the cascading style sheet block, and also attaches a tag to each element that implements that behavior component. In other words, using existing cascading style sheet support in the renderer , a behavior can be added to an element. The behavior property in cascading style sheets typically has the following syntax:",{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0027","num":"0026"},"tables":{"@attributes":{"id":"TABLE-US-00001","num":"00001"},"table":{"@attributes":{"frame":"none","colsep":"0","rowsep":"0"},"tgroup":{"@attributes":{"align":"left","colsep":"0","rowsep":"0","cols":"2"},"colspec":[{"@attributes":{"colname":"offset","colwidth":"28pt","align":"left"}},{"@attributes":{"colname":"1","colwidth":"189pt","align":"left"}}],"thead":{"row":{"entry":[{},{"@attributes":{"namest":"offset","nameend":"1","align":"center","rowsep":"1"}}]}},"tbody":{"@attributes":{"valign":"top"},"row":[{"entry":[{},"Behavior:url( url pointing to behavior component )"]},{"entry":[{},{"@attributes":{"namest":"offset","nameend":"1","align":"center","rowsep":"1"}}]}]}}}}},"This syntax can be used in any standard style declaration, for example, in an Inline style declaration on an element, as described below.

The result is dynamic HTML via a substantially cleaner, script-free page.","By way of example, as shown in , the behavior component is maintained in a file called hilite.htc, (where HTC stands for HTML Component) and is referenced by the behavior tag <LI> in the cascading style sheet block of the page (as indicated by the <Style> tags). This behavior component , shown for purposes of clarity in  as having human-readable script therein, affects the way text appears when the mouse is over that text, i.e., provides mouseover highlights. In other words, this behavior, when applied to an \u201cLI\u201d (list item) element in the body of the page , extends the list item's default behavior to change its color when the user moves the mouse over it, and then restore its original color when the mouse is moved off of the item.

Note that when using the behavior attribute, the type of behavior, i.e., a behavior implemented as a binary component (using C++ or any compiled code), a default behavior (built into the renderer ), or as a component written in script (either as an HTML Component or as a scriptlet) determines the syntax used to apply the behavior to an element using cascading style sheets.

Conversely, a behavior attached to an element through an inline style, or through the addBehavior method, is not automatically detached from the element when the element is removed from the document hierarchy. These two methods of applying behaviors have no dependencies on the containing document, and therefore the behavior remains applied to the element even as it is removed from the document tree. The removeBehavior method can be invoked to explicitly detach this type of behavior from the element.","Multiple behaviors can be applied to an element, for example by specifying a space-delimited list of URLs for the behavior attribute, as shown in the following code.

In the above example, if there are no conflicting style assignments between the two behaviors, any style changes made by both behaviors are applied unaltered to the element.

When a behavior is applied to an element, the element's properties, methods, and events are extended to include those exposed by the behavior.","Turning to an explanation of the present invention from the perspective of the renderer , the renderer  operates in response to an event to interpret the appropriate page elements. In keeping with the present invention, when an element in the HTML document having a behavior component attached is parsed by the renderer , instead of having to run a script, the renderer  instantiates (or uses if already instantiated) the behavior component to perform some action. Instantiation of behavior component may require downloading, and, if a download is required, the component may be downloaded and instantiated on a separate thread whereby the parsing of the main document is not halted.","As generally described below, when an event is received, (e.g., from some event detector , ) the renderer  knows to which element the event applies, and takes appropriate action based on that event. Events fired by behaviors are handled the same way as standard DHTML events, and are thus only generally described herein for purposes of simplicity. First, the user action or condition associated with the event occurs. An event object is updated to reflect the conditions of the event, and the event fires, i.e., a notification is provided in response to the event.  generally represents the actions taken when an event notification is received. At step , the lowest element in the hierarchy is selected, and tested for whether it has an associated event handler for this particular event. As generally described above, the ATTACH element may be used to associate an event handler  () to a specific event and specific element or object in order for the handler to be called when the event fires. Other ways of attaching event handlers to DHTML elements are well known to those skilled in the art and are not described herein.","If no event handler is attached, the event bubbles up through the hierarchy of elements until the top of the hierarchy has been reached, (i.e., until the event bubbles up to the window object), as represented by steps -. If an event handler  is attached to the current element, such as to handle mouseover events, at step  the event handler  is called to carry out its actions and return. For example, as represented via steps -, the event handler  may determine if a behavior component needs to be instantiated (step ), and if so, instantiates the behavior (step ). Then, the event handler  (or renderer) calls a method of that behavior (step ) on an interface , passing it any needed information (e.g., the rendered element's coordinates) to carry out its actions to affect the element's appearance or behavior, (e.g., to change the rendered element's color). Note that some or all of the event handler functions described herein may be performed by the renderer , e.g., instantiating the behavior as needed, and calling a method thereof, while other event handler operations may be written into the behavior component. A dashed box is used to represent the event handler  in  because its functionality can be thus performed by other components.","An event handler can cancel the bubbling of an event, as represented by step , wherein the event is considered fully handled. Otherwise the event handling process branches to step , where the event bubbles up through the hierarchical tree of elements via steps  and . A final default action (optional at step , shown as a dashed box) may be taken if the event not canceled by a handler at step .","Basic interfaces for calling an instantiated behavior component are set forth below, along with accompanying information:",{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0060","num":"0059"},"tables":{"@attributes":{"id":"TABLE-US-00013","num":"00013"},"table":{"@attributes":{"frame":"none","colsep":"0","rowsep":"0"},"tgroup":{"@attributes":{"align":"left","colsep":"0","rowsep":"0","cols":"2"},"colspec":[{"@attributes":{"colname":"1","colwidth":"91pt","align":"left"}},{"@attributes":{"colname":"2","colwidth":"126pt","align":"left"}}],"thead":{"row":{"entry":{"@attributes":{"namest":"1","nameend":"2","align":"center","rowsep":"1"}}}},"tbody":{"@attributes":{"valign":"top"},"row":[{"entry":["IElementBehavior","Receives notifications from"]},{"entry":[{},"MSHTML.d11 concerning the activities"]},{"entry":[{},"of DHTML behaviors."]},{"entry":["IElementBehaviorCategory","Provides DHTML behaviors a means of"]},{"entry":[{},"identifying their category."]},{"entry":["IElementBehaviorFactory","Provides DHTML behavior"]},{"entry":[{},"implementation to the MSHTML"]},{"entry":[{},"component of Internet Explorer 5."]},{"entry":["IElementBehaviorRender","Enables a behavior component to"]},{"entry":[{},"participate in the rendering of text and"]},{"entry":[{},"objects."]},{"entry":["IelementBehaviorSiteCategory","Provides DHTML behaviors a means of"]},{"entry":[{},"identifying other related behaviors by"]},{"entry":[{},"category."]},{"entry":["IElementBehaviorSite","Provides communication between"]},{"entry":[{},"MSHTML and component."]},{"entry":["IElementBehaviorSiteOM","Provides event services to behavior"]},{"entry":[{},"components."]},{"entry":{"@attributes":{"namest":"1","nameend":"2","align":"center","rowsep":"1"}}}]}}}}},"The IElementBehavior interface is an event sink that receives notifications from Mshtml.dll concerning the activities of Dynamic HTML (DHTML) behaviors.

If any ill-formed, overlapping, or implied HTML tags are present, the renderer  will build the document tree to the best of its ability and render the page image accordingly.

As described above, an extensible tag can use the renderer  to handle rendering of its data simply by placing the relevant content in the document tree, whereby the renderer 's rendering abilities do the rest. However there are definite aspects of rendering that the renderer  cannot achieve, such as circles, curves and line drawing.","To allow an extensible tag component to extend the browser's abilities in this area, a new drawing interface is established which the behavior component implements, and the renderer  calls at appropriate times during its rendering. When called, the drawing behavior component is passed a drawing surface that is windowless, such that any drawing can fit into a specified z-index and be subject to any filter and transition effects.","The renderer  draws in four passes, namely, 1) Background, the background of the document; 2) Negative-Z, any Z-index layers below the current element of interest; 3) Content\u2014the content of the current element; and 4) Positive-Z, any Z-Index layers that are above the element.","The extensible tag behavior component may prevent the renderer  from drawing any of the above four rendering layers, and also may provide drawing at any five additional layers that interleave renderer's layers. As represented in , these five layers are 1) Before Background, before the renderer  even draws the background of the document; 2) After Background, between the renderer's Background and Negative-Z layers; 3) Before Content, between the renderer's Negative-Z and Content layers; 4) After Content, between the renderers Content and Positive-Z layers; and 5) After Foreground, after the renderer's Positive-Z layer.
