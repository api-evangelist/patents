No. 62\/075,671, filed Nov. 5, 2014, and 62\/098,022, filed Dec. 30, 2014, respectively, the entire content of which are incorporated herein by reference.","Indoleamine 2,3-dioxygenase (IDO; also known as IDO1) is an IFN-\u03b3 target gene that plays a role in immunomodulation. IDO is an oxidoreductase and one of two enzymes that catalyze the first and rate-limiting step in the conversion of tryptophan to N-formyl-kynurenine. It exists as a 41 kD monomer that is found in several cell populations, including immune cells, endothelial cells, and fibroblasts. IDO is relatively well-conserved between species, with mouse and human sharing 63% sequence identity at the amino acid level. Data derived from its crystal structure and site-directed mutagenesis show that both substrate binding and the relationship between the substrate and iron-bound dioxygenase are necessary for activity. A homolog to IDO (IDO2) has been identified that shares 44% amino acid sequence homology with IDO, but its function is largely distinct from that of IDO. (See, e.g., Serafini P, et al., 16(1):53-65 (February 2006) and Ball, H. J. et al., 396(1):203-213 (July 2007)).","IDO plays a major role in immune regulation, and its immunosuppressive function manifests in several manners. Importantly, IDO regulates immunity at the T cell level, and a nexus exists between IDO and cytokine production. In addition, tumors frequently manipulate immune function by upregulation of IDO. Thus, modulation of IDO can have a therapeutic impact on a number of diseases, disorders and conditions.","A pathophysiological link exists between IDO and cancer. Disruption of immune homeostasis is intimately involved with tumor growth and progression, and the production of IDO in the tumor microenvironment appears to aid in tumor growth and metastasis. Moreover, increased levels of IDO activity are associated with a variety of different tumors (Brandacher, G. et al., 12(4):1144-1151 (Feb. 15, 2006)).","Treatment of cancer commonly entails surgical resection followed by chemotherapy and radiotherapy. The standard treatment regimens show highly variable degrees of long-term success because of the ability of tumor cells to essentially escape by regenerating primary tumor growth and, often more importantly, seeding distant metastasis. Recent advances in the treatment of cancer and cancer-related diseases, disorders and conditions comprise the use of combination therapy incorporating immunotherapy with more traditional chemotherapy and radiotherapy. Under most scenarios, immunotherapy is associated with less toxicity than traditional chemotherapy because it utilizes the patient's own immune system to identify and eliminate tumor cells.","In addition to cancer, IDO has been implicated in, among other conditions, immunosuppression, chronic infections, and autoimmune diseases or disorders (e.g., rheumatoid arthritis). Thus, suppression of tryptophan degradation by inhibition of IDO activity has tremendous therapeutic value. Moreover, inhibitors of IDO can be used to enhance T cell activation when the T cells are suppressed by pregnancy, malignancy, or a virus (e.g., HIV). Although their roles are not as well defined, IDO inhibitors may also find use in the treatment of patients with neurological or neuropsychiatric diseases or disorders (e.g., depression).","Small molecule inhibitors of IDO have been developed to treat or prevent IDO-related diseases. For example, the IDO inhibitors 1-methyl-DL-tryptophan; p-(3-benzofuranyl)-DL-alanine; p-[3-benzo(b)thienyl]-DL-alanine; and 6-nitro-L-tryptophan have been used to modulate T cell-mediated immunity by altering local extracellular concentrations of tryptophan and tryptophan metabolites (WO 99\/29310). Compounds having IDO inhibitory activity are further reported in WO 2004\/094409.","In view of the role played by indoleamine 2,3-dioxygenase in a diverse array of diseases, disorders and conditions, and the limitations (e.g., efficacy) of current IDO inhibitors, new IDO modulators, and compositions and methods associated therewith, are needed.","The present invention relates to compounds that modulate the oxidoreductase enzyme indoleamine 2,3-dioxygenase (IDO), and compositions (e.g., pharmaceutical compositions) comprising the compounds. Such compounds, including methods of their synthesis, and compositions are described in detail below.","The present invention also relates to the use of such compounds and compositions for the treatment and\/or prevention of a diverse array of diseases, disorders and conditions mediated, in whole or in part, by IDO.

It is envisaged that the compounds may alternatively effect their activity through inhibition of tryptophan-2,3-dioxygenase (TDO) activity. It is also envisaged that the compounds may effect their activity through inhibition of both IDO and TDO function.

An IDO inhibitor may be a competitive, noncompetitive, or irreversible IDO inhibitor. \u201cA competitive IDO inhibitor\u201d is a compound that reversibly inhibits IDO enzyme activity at the catalytic site; \u201ca noncompetitive IDO Inhibitor\u201d is a compound that reversibly inhibits IDO enzyme activity at a non-catalytic site; and \u201can irreversible IDO inhibitor\u201d is a compound that irreversibly eliminates IDO enzyme activity by forming a covalent bond (or other stable means of inhibiting enzyme function) with the enzyme. A number of IDO inhibitors are commercially available (e.g., 5-Br-4-Cl-indoxyl 1,3-diacetate and 1-methyl-DL-tryptophan (1 MT); both available from Sigma-Aldrich, St. Louis, Mo.) and may be used as, for example, \u201ctool\u201d or \u201creference\u201d compounds","The term \u201cligand\u201d refers to, for example, a peptide, a polypeptide, a membrane-associated or membrane-bound molecule, or a complex thereof, that can act as an agonist or antagonist of a receptor. A ligand encompasses natural and synthetic ligands, e.g., cytokines, cytokine variants, analogs, muteins, and binding compositions derived from antibodies, as well as small molecules. The term also encompasses an agent that is neither an agonist nor antagonist, but that can bind to a receptor without significantly influencing its biological properties, e.g., signaling or adhesion. Moreover, the term includes a membrane-bound ligand that has been changed by, e.g., chemical or recombinant methods, to a soluble version of the membrane-bound ligand. A ligand or receptor may be entirely intracellular, that is, it may reside in the cytosol, nucleus, or some other intracellular compartment. The complex of a ligand and receptor is termed a \u201cligand-receptor complex\u201d.","The terms \u201cinhibitors\u201d and \u201cantagonists\u201d, or \u201cactivators\u201d and \u201cagonists\u201d refer to inhibitory or activating molecules, respectively, for example, for the activation of, e.g., a ligand, receptor, cofactor, gene, cell, tissue, or organ. Inhibitors are molecules that decrease, block, prevent, delay activation, inactivate, desensitize, or down-regulate, e.g., a gene, protein, ligand, receptor, or cell. Activators are molecules that increase, activate, facilitate, enhance activation, sensitize, or up-regulate, e.g., a gene, protein, ligand, receptor, or cell. An inhibitor may also be defined as a molecule that reduces, blocks, or inactivates a constitutive activity. An \u201cagonist\u201d is a molecule that interacts with a target to cause or promote an increase in the activation of the target. An \u201cantagonist\u201d is a molecule that opposes the action(s) of an agonist. An antagonist prevents, reduces, inhibits, or neutralizes the activity of an agonist, and an antagonist can also prevent, inhibit, or reduce constitutive activity of a target, e.g., a target receptor, even where there is no identified agonist.","The terms \u201cmodulate\u201d, \u201cmodulation\u201d and the like refer to the ability of a molecule (e.g., an activator or an inhibitor) to increase or decrease the function or activity of IDO, either directly or indirectly. A modulator may act alone, or it may use a cofactor, e.g., a protein, metal ion, or small molecule. Examples of modulators include small molecule compounds and other bioorganic molecules. Numerous libraries of small molecule compounds (e.g., combinatorial libraries) are commercially available and can serve as a starting point for identifying a modulator. The skilled artisan is able to develop one or more assays (e.g., biochemical or cell-based assays) in which such compound libraries can be screened in order to identify one or more compounds having the desired properties; thereafter, the skilled medicinal chemist is able to optimize such one or more compounds by, for example, synthesizing and evaluating analogs and derivatives thereof. Synthetic and\/or molecular modeling studies can also be utilized in the identification of an Activator.","The \u201cactivity\u201d of a molecule may describe or refer to the binding of the molecule to a ligand or to a receptor; to catalytic activity; to the ability to stimulate gene expression or cell signaling, differentiation, or maturation; to antigenic activity; to the modulation of activities of other molecules; and the like. The term \u201cproliferative activity\u201d encompasses an activity that promotes, that is necessary for, or that is specifically associated with, for example, normal cell division, as well as cancer, tumors, dysplasia, cell transformation, metastasis, and angiogenesis.","As used herein, \u201ccomparable\u201d, \u201ccomparable activity\u201d, \u201cactivity comparable to\u201d, \u201ccomparable effect\u201d, \u201ceffect comparable to\u201d, and the like are relative terms that can be viewed quantitatively and\/or qualitatively. The meaning of the terms is frequently dependent on the context in which they are used. By way of example, two agents that both activate a receptor can be viewed as having a comparable effect from a qualitative perspective, but the two agents can be viewed as lacking a comparable effect from a quantitative perspective if one agent is only able to achieve 20% of the activity of the other agent as determined in an art-accepted assay (e.g., a dose-response assay) or in an art-accepted animal model. When comparing one result to another result (e.g., one result to a reference standard), \u201ccomparable\u201d frequently (though not always) means that one result deviates from a reference standard by less than 35%, by less than 30%, by less than 25%, by less than 20%, by less than 15%, by less than 10%, by less than 7%, by less than 5%, by less than 4%, by less than 3%, by less than 2%, or by less than 1%. In particular embodiments, one result is comparable to a reference standard if it deviates by less than 15%, by less than 10%, or by less than 5% from the reference standard. By way of example, but not limitation, the activity or effect may refer to efficacy, stability, solubility, or immunogenicity.","\u201cSubstantially pure\u201d indicates that a component makes up greater than about 50% of the total content of the composition, and typically greater than about 60% of the total polypeptide content. More typically, \u201csubstantially pure\u201d refers to compositions in which at least 75%, at least 85%, at least 90% or more of the total composition is the component of interest. In some cases, the polypeptide will make up greater than about 90%, or greater than about 95% of the total content of the composition.","The terms \u201cspecifically binds\u201d or \u201cselectively binds\u201d, when referring to a ligand\/receptor, antibody\/antigen, or other binding pair, indicates a binding reaction which is determinative of the presence of the protein in a heterogeneous population of proteins and other biologics. Thus, under designated conditions, a specified ligand binds to a particular receptor and does not bind in a significant amount to other proteins present in the sample. The antibody, or binding composition derived from the antigen-binding site of an antibody, of the contemplated method binds to its antigen, or a variant or mutein thereof, with an affinity that is at least two-fold greater, at least ten times greater, at least 20-times greater, or at least 100-times greater than the affinity with any other antibody, or binding composition derived therefrom. In a particular embodiment, the antibody will have an affinity that is greater than about 10liters\/mol, as determined by, e.g., Scatchard analysis (Munsen, et al., 1980 Analyt. Biochem. 107:220-239).","The term \u201cresponse\u201d, for example, of a cell, tissue, organ, or organism, encompasses a change in biochemical or physiological behavior, e.g., concentration, density, adhesion, or migration within a biological compartment, rate of gene expression, or state of differentiation, where the change is correlated with activation, stimulation, or treatment, or with internal mechanisms such as genetic programming. In certain contexts, the terms \u201cactivation\u201d, \u201cstimulation\u201d, and the like refer to cell activation as regulated by internal mechanisms, as well as by external or environmental factors; whereas the terms \u201cinhibition\u201d, \u201cdown-regulation\u201d and the like refer to the opposite effects.","The terms \u201cpolypeptide\u201d, \u201cpeptide\u201d, and \u201cprotein\u201d, used interchangeably herein, refer to a polymeric form of amino acids of any length, which can include genetically coded and non-genetically coded amino acids, chemically or biochemically modified or derivatized amino acids, and polypeptides having modified polypeptide backbones. The terms include fusion proteins, including, but not limited to, fusion proteins with a heterologous amino acid sequence, fusion proteins with heterologous and homologous leader sequences, with or without N-terminus methionine residues; immunologically tagged proteins; and the like.","As used herein, the terms \u201cvariants\u201d and \u201chomologs\u201d are used interchangeably to refer to amino acid or DNA sequences that are similar to reference amino acid or nucleic acid sequences, respectively. The term encompasses naturally-occurring variants and non-naturally-occurring variants. Naturally-occurring variants include homologs (polypeptides and nucleic acids that differ in amino acid or nucleotide sequence, respectively, from one species to another), and allelic variants (polypeptides and nucleic acids that differ in amino acid or nucleotide sequence, respectively, from one individual to another within a species). Thus, variants and homologs encompass naturally occurring DNA sequences and proteins encoded thereby and their isoforms, as well as splice variants of a protein or gene. The terms also encompass nucleic acid sequences that vary in one or more bases from a naturally-occurring DNA sequence but still translate into an amino acid sequence that corresponds to the naturally-occurring protein due to degeneracy of the genetic code. Non-naturally-occurring variants and homologs include polypeptides and nucleic acids that comprise a change in amino acid or nucleotide sequence, respectively, where the change in sequence is artificially introduced (e.g., muteins); for example, the change is generated in the laboratory by human intervention (\u201chand of man\u201d). Therefore, non-naturally occurring variants and homologs may also refer to those that differ from the naturally-occurring sequences by one or more conservative substitutions and\/or tags and\/or conjugates.","The term \u201cmuteins\u201d as used herein refers broadly to mutated recombinant proteins. These proteins usually carry single or multiple amino acid substitutions and are frequently derived from cloned genes that have been subjected to site-directed or random mutagenesis, or from completely synthetic genes.","The terms \u201cDNA\u201d, \u201cnucleic acid\u201d, \u201cnucleic acid molecule\u201d, \u201cpolynucleotide\u201d and the like are used interchangeably herein to refer to a polymeric form of nucleotides of any length, either deoxyribonucleotides or ribonucleotides, or analogs thereof. Non-limiting examples of polynucleotides include linear and circular nucleic acids, messenger RNA (mRNA), complementary DNA (cDNA), recombinant polynucleotides, vectors, probes, primers and the like.","Indoleamine 2,3-Dioxygenase","As previously alluded to, IDO is an immune regulatory enzyme that is normally expressed in tumor cells and in activated immune cells. IDO is one of several immune response checkpoints that are involved in tumor immune escape; thus, IDO inhibitors disrupt mechanisms by which tumors evade the body's normal immune system.","IDO down-regulates the immune response mediated through oxidation of tryptophan. This results in inhibition of T-cell activation and induction of T-cell apoptosis, creating an environment in which tumor-specific cytotoxic T lymphocytes are rendered functionally inactive or are no longer able to attack a subject's cancer cells. Therefore, therapeutic agents aimed at suppression of tryptophan degradation by inhibiting IDO activity are desirable. Inhibitors of IDO can be used to activate T cells and therefore enhance T cell activation when the T cells are suppressed by pregnancy, malignancy or a virus such as HIV. Inhibition of IDO may also be an important treatment strategy for patients with neurological or neuropsychiatric diseases or disorders such as depression. The compounds, compositions and methods herein help meet the current need for IDO modulators.","The expression of IDO is modulated by a complex array of signals, thus implicating a number of different mechanisms of actions. For example, IDO may be induced by inhibition of DNA methyl transferases or histone deacetylases. The NF-\u03baB signaling pathway has also been implicated in IDO function. Inhibiting NF-kB activity blocks IDO expression and produces robust anti-tumor responses that are both T cell- and IDO-dependent; alternatively, NF-\u03baB activation (which may be effected by various factors such as interferon-\u03b3R1\/-\u03b3R2 signaling and toll-like-receptor activation) induces IDO gene expression.","Other mechanisms are involved with modulation of IDO function. By way of example, inhibitors of reactive oxidative species (ROS) may effect stabilization of IDO; IDO levels may be modulated by inhibition or activation of pathways that are both downstream and upstream of IDO; and activation of interferon-\u03b3 can activate an autocrine induction of IDO.","Studies indicate that the IDO pathway is active in many cancers, both within tumor cells as a direct defense against T cell attack, and also within antigen-presenting cells (APCs) in tumor-draining lymph nodes resulting in peripheral tolerance to tumor-associated antigens (TAAs). Cancers may use the IDO pathway to facilitate survival, growth, invasion, and metastasis of malignant cells expressing TAAs that might otherwise be recognized and attacked by the immune system.","As alluded to herein, tryptophan catabolism in tumor tissue by the rate-limiting enzyme IDO provides an opportunity for the use of IDO inhibitors as a therapeutic alternative to, or an additive with, conventional chemotherapy. However, certain cancers are capable of catabolizing tryptophan but are largely IDO-negative. Recent studies indicate that the alternative enzymatic pathway of tryptophan catabolism involving tryptophan-2,3-dioxygenase (TDO) is also relevant in cancer. TDO, which is considered responsible for regulating systemic tryptophan levels in the liver, is constitutively expressed in some cancers and is also capable of suppressing antitumor immune responses (See, e.g., Platten, M. et al., 72(21):5435-5440 (Nov. 1, 2012)).","IDO is expressed in a wide variety of human tumors and tumor cell lines as well as in host APCs, which correlates with a worse clinical prognosis. Therefore, inhibition of IDO may improve survival in cancer patients with IDO-mediated immunosuppression. In comparison, TDO is expressed in a wide variety of human tumors and tumor cell lines, and expression of TDO is evident in advanced human glioblastomas. The identification of tumors expressing high levels of IDO or TDO may allow more selective inhibition of the tryptophan-regulated immunosuppressive pathways. Alternatively, compounds inhibiting both IDO and TDO could provide the greatest coverage to prevent tumor escape by compensatory expression of the other tryptophan-degrading enzyme. Therefore, the use of dual IDO\/TDO inhibitors or combinations of IDO- and TDO-specific inhibitors may prove to be a superior treatment alternative in immunotherapy of cancer to block immunosuppression mediated by tryptophan metabolism.","Although a precise understanding of the underlying mechanism of action by which the compounds of the present invention effect their activity is not required to practice the invention, the compounds (or a subset thereof) are believed to inhibit IDO function. Alternatively, the compounds (or a subset thereof) may inhibit TDO function. The compounds (or a subset thereof) may also have inhibitory activity on both IDO and TDO function. Although the compounds of the invention are generally referred to herein as IDO inhibitors, it is to be understood that the term \u201cIDO inhibitors\u201d encompasses compounds that act individually through inhibition of TDO or IDO, and\/or compounds that act through inhibition of both IDO and TDO.","Identification of IDO Inhibitors Possessing Desirable Characteristics","The present invention is drawn, in part, to the identification of inhibitors of IDO with at least one property or characteristic that is of therapeutic relevance. Candidate inhibitors may be identified by using, for example, an art-accepted assay or model, examples of which are described herein.","After identification, candidate inhibitors can be further evaluated by using techniques that provide data regarding characteristics of the inhibitors (e.g., pharmacokinetic parameters, means of determining solubility or stability). Comparisons of the candidate inhibitors to a reference standard (which may the \u201cbest-of-class\u201d of current inhibitors) are indicative of the potential viability of such candidates.","Compounds of the Invention","As noted above, the present invention provides compounds represented by formula (I):",{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0095","num":"0094"},"chemistry":{"@attributes":{"id":"CHEM-US-00002","num":"00002"},"img":{"@attributes":{"id":"EMI-C00002","he":"28.62mm","wi":"63.25mm","file":"US09643972-20170509-C00002.TIF","alt":"embedded image","img-content":"chem","img-format":"tif"}}},"br":{},"sub":["5-7 ","2","1","4 ","3","6 ","1","4 ","1","4 ","2","2","2","3","2","3","3","2","3","2","3","2","1","3 ","1","6 ","2","6 ","2","6 ","1","6 ","3","6 ","1","4 ","1","6 ","2","2","2","1","6 ","m","m","2","m","2","m","m","2","m","2","m","2","1","6 ","1","6 ","1","6 ","1","6 ","2"],"sup":["5a","3a","5a","5","5a","6","5","5a","1 ","2 ","1 ","2 ","3","3a ","4 ","5","5","5","5","5","5","5","5","5","5","5","5","5","5","5","5","5","5 ","5a ","6 ","5a"]},"In some embodiments, Q is C(CN) or CR.","In some embodiments, compounds are provided having formula (Ia) or (Ib):",{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0098","num":"0097"},"chemistry":{"@attributes":{"id":"CHEM-US-00003","num":"00003"},"img":{"@attributes":{"id":"EMI-C00003","he":"61.47mm","wi":"63.84mm","file":"US09643972-20170509-C00003.TIF","alt":"embedded image","img-content":"chem","img-format":"tif"}}},"br":{},"sup":["1","2","3","4 ","6 "]},"In other embodiments, compounds are provided having formula (Ic):",{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0100","num":"0099"},"chemistry":{"@attributes":{"id":"CHEM-US-00004","num":"00004"},"img":{"@attributes":{"id":"EMI-C00004","he":"31.75mm","wi":"63.08mm","file":"US09643972-20170509-C00004.TIF","alt":"embedded image","img-content":"chem","img-format":"tif"}}},"br":{},"sup":["1 ","2","2 ","1","1","2","3","4 ","6 "]},"In some selected embodiments, compounds are provided having a formula selected from (Ic1), (Ic2), (Ic3), (Ic4), (Ic5) and (Ic6):",{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0102","num":"0101"},"chemistry":{"@attributes":{"id":"CHEM-US-00005","num":"00005"},"img":{"@attributes":{"id":"EMI-C00005","he":"223.86mm","wi":"63.75mm","file":"US09643972-20170509-C00005.TIF","alt":"embedded image","img-content":"chem","img-format":"tif"}}},"br":{},"sup":["1 ","2","2 ","1","1","2","3","3a","4 ","6 "]},"In other embodiments, compounds are provided having formula (Id):",{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0104","num":"0103"},"chemistry":{"@attributes":{"id":"CHEM-US-00006","num":"00006"},"img":{"@attributes":{"id":"EMI-C00006","he":"33.87mm","wi":"61.21mm","file":"US09643972-20170509-C00006.TIF","alt":"embedded image","img-content":"chem","img-format":"tif"}}},"br":{},"sup":["1 ","2","2 ","1","1","2","3","3a ","6 "]},"In some selected embodiments, compounds are provided having a formula selected from (Id1), (Id2), (Id3) and (Id4):",{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0106","num":"0105"},"chemistry":{"@attributes":{"id":"CHEM-US-00007","num":"00007"},"img":{"@attributes":{"id":"EMI-C00007","he":"177.80mm","wi":"71.97mm","file":"US09643972-20170509-C00007.TIF","alt":"embedded image","img-content":"chem","img-format":"tif"}}}},"wherein for each of (Id1) and (Id2), the compounds are provided substantially free of other isomers at the stereocenters shown.

Improvements of physical properties include, for example, methods of increasing water solubility, bioavailability, serum half-life, and\/or therapeutic half-life; and\/or modulating biological activity.","Modifications known in the art include pegylation, Fc-fusion and albumin fusion. Although generally associated with large molecule agents (e.g., polypeptides), such modifications have recently been evaluated with particular small molecules. By way of example, Chiang, M. et al. (136(9):3370-3373 (2014)) describe a small molecule agonist of the adenosine 2a receptor conjugated to the immunoglobulin Fc domain. The small molecule-Fc conjugate retained potent Fc receptor and adenosine 2a receptor interactions and showed superior properties compared to the unconjugated small molecule. Covalent attachment of PEG molecules to small molecule therapeutics has also been described (Li, W. et al., 38:421-444 (2013)).","Therapeutic and Prophylactic Uses","The present invention contemplates the use of the IDO inhibitors described herein in the treatment or prevention of a broad range of diseases, disorders and\/or conditions, and\/or the symptoms thereof. While particular uses are described in detail hereafter, it is to be understood that the present invention is not so limited. Furthermore, although general categories of particular diseases, disorders and conditions are set forth hereafter, some of the diseases, disorders and conditions may be a member of more than one category, and others may not be a member of any of the disclosed categories.","Oncology-related Disorders. In accordance with the present invention, an IDO inhibitor can be used to treat or prevent a proliferative condition or disorder, including a cancer, for example, cancer of the uterus, cervix, breast, prostate, testes, gastrointestinal tract (e.g., esophagus, oropharynx, stomach, small or large intestines, colon, or rectum), kidney, renal cell, bladder, bone, bone marrow, skin, head or neck, liver, gall bladder, heart, lung, pancreas, salivary gland, adrenal gland, thyroid, brain (e.g., gliomas), ganglia, central nervous system (CNS) and peripheral nervous system (PNS), and cancers of the hematopoietic system and the immune system (e.g., spleen or thymus). The present invention also provides methods of treating or preventing other cancer-related diseases, disorders or conditions, including, for example, immunogenic tumors, non-immunogenic tumors, dormant tumors, virus-induced cancers (e.g., epithelial cell cancers, endothelial cell cancers, squamous cell carcinomas and papillomavirus), adenocarcinomas, lymphomas, carcinomas, melanomas, leukemias, myelomas, sarcomas, teratocarcinomas, chemically-induced cancers, metastasis, and angiogenesis. The invention contemplates reducing tolerance to a tumor cell or cancer cell antigen, e.g., by modulating activity of a regulatory T-cell and\/or a CD8+ T-cell (see, e.g., Ramirez-Montagut et al., 22:3180-3187 (2003); and Sawaya et al., 349:1501-1509 (2003)). In particular embodiments, the tumor or cancer is colon cancer, ovarian cancer, breast cancer, melanoma, lung cancer, glioblastoma, or leukemia. The use of the term(s) cancer-related diseases, disorders and conditions is meant to refer broadly to conditions that are associated, directly or indirectly, with cancer, and includes, e.g., angiogenesis and precancerous conditions such as dysplasia.","In some embodiments, the present invention provides methods for treating a proliferative condition, cancer, tumor, or precancerous condition with an IDO inhibitor and at least one additional therapeutic or diagnostic agent, examples of which are set forth elsewhere herein.","Immune- and Inflammatory-related Disorders. As used herein, terms such as \u201cimmune disease\u201d, \u201cimmune condition\u201d, \u201cimmune disorder\u201d, \u201cinflammatory disease\u201d, \u201cinflammatory condition\u201d, \u201cinflammatory disorder\u201d and the like are meant to broadly encompass any immune- or inflammatory-related condition (e.g., pathological inflammation and autoimmune diseases). Such conditions frequently are inextricably intertwined with other diseases, disorders and conditions. By way of example, an \u201cimmune condition\u201d may refer to proliferative conditions, such as cancer, tumors, and angiogenesis; including infections (acute and chronic), tumors, and cancers that resist eradication by the immune system.","A non-limiting list of immune- and inflammatory-related diseases, disorders and conditions which may be treated or prevented with the compounds and compositions of the present invention include, arthritis (e.g., rheumatoid arthritis), kidney failure, lupus, asthma, psoriasis, colitis, pancreatitis, allergies, fibrosis, surgical complications (e.g., where inflammatory cytokines prevent healing), anemia, and fibromyalgia. Other diseases and disorders which may be associated with chronic inflammation include Alzheimer's disease, congestive heart failure, stroke, aortic valve stenosis, arteriosclerosis, osteoporosis, Parkinson's disease, infections, inflammatory bowel disease (e.g., Crohn's disease and ulcerative colitis), allergic contact dermatitis and other eczemas, systemic sclerosis, transplantation and multiple sclerosis.","Among other immune-related disorders, it is contemplated that inhibition of IDO function may also play a role in immunologic tolerance and prevention of fetal rejection in utero.","In some embodiments, an IDO inhibitor described herein can be combined with an immunosuppressive agent to reduce the number of immune effector cells.","Some of the aforementioned diseases, disorders and conditions for which an IDO inhibitor may be particularly efficacious (due to, for example, limitations of current therapies) are described in more detail hereafter.","Rheumatoid Arthritis (RA), which is generally characterized by chronic inflammation in the membrane lining (the synovium) of the joints, affects approximately 1% of the U.S. population (\u02dc2.1 million people). Further understanding of the role of cytokines, including TNF-\u03b1 and IL-1, in the inflammatory process has enabled the development and introduction of a new class of disease-modifying antirheumatic drugs (DMARDs). Agents (some of which overlap with treatment modalities for RA) include ENBREL\u00ae (etanercept), REMICADE\u00ae (infliximab), HUMIRA\u00ae (adalimumab) and KINERET\u00ae (anakinra). Though some of these agents relieve symptoms, inhibit progression of structural damage, and improve physical function in particular patient populations, there is still a need for alternative agents with improved efficacy, complementary mechanisms of action, and fewer\/less severe adverse effects.","Psoriasis, a constellation of common immune-mediated chronic skin diseases, affects more than 4.5 million people in the U.S., of which 1.5 million are considered to have a moderate-to severe form of the disease. Moreover, over 10% of patients with psoriasis develop psoriatic arthritis, which damages the bone and connective tissue around the joints. An improved understanding of the underlying physiology of psoriasis has resulted in the introduction of agents that, for example, target the activity of T lymphocytes and cytokines responsible for the inflammatory nature of the disease. Such agents include the TNF-\u03b1 inhibitors (also used in the treatment of rheumatoid arthritis (RA)), including ENBREL\u00ae (etanercept), REMICADE\u00ae (infliximab) and HUMIRA\u00ae (adalimumab)), and T-cell inhibitors such as AMEVIVE\u00ae (alefacept) and RAPTIVA\u00ae (efalizumab). Though several of these agents are effective to some extent in certain patient populations, none have been shown to effectively treat all patients.","Subjects suffering from multiple sclerosis (MS), a seriously debilitating autoimmune disease comprising multiple areas of inflammation and scarring of the myelin in the brain and spinal cord, may be particularly helped by the IDO inhibitors described herein, as current treatments only alleviate symptoms or delay the progression of disability.","Similarly, the IDO inhibitors may be particularly advantageous for subjects afflicted with neurodegenerative disorders, such as Alzheimer's disease (AD), a brain disorder that seriously impairs patients' thought, memory, and language processes; and Parkinson's disease (PD), a progressive disorder of the CNS characterized by, for example, abnormal movement, rigidity and tremor. These disorders are progressive and debilitating, and no curative agents are available.","Viral-related Disorders. The present invention contemplates the use of the IDO inhibitors in the treatment and\/or prevention of any viral disease, disorder or condition for which treatment with an IDO inhibitor may be beneficial. In particular embodiments, the viral disorder is a chronic viral disorder. Examples of viral diseases, disorders and conditions that are contemplated include, but are not limited to, hepatitis B virus (HBV), hepatitis C virus (HCV), human papilloma virus (HPV), HIV, AIDS (including its manifestations such as cachexia, dementia, and diarrhea), herpes simplex virus (HSV), Epstein-Barr virus (EBV), varicella zoster virus, coxsackie virus, and cytomegalovirus (CMV).","Bacterial- and Parasitic-related Disorders. Embodiments of the present invention contemplate the administration of the IDO inhibitors described herein to a subject for the treatment of a bacterial infection, for example, a infection (e.g., or ) or an infection caused by or . Other embodiments contemplate the treatment of a parasitic infection including, but not limited to, , or . Frequently, anti-parasitic therapy is administered prophylactically (e.g., before a subject travels to an area with a high frequency of parasitic infection).","Pharmaceutical Compositions","The IDO inhibitors of the present invention may be in the form of compositions suitable for administration to a subject. In general, such compositions are \u201cpharmaceutical compositions\u201d comprising an IDO inhibitor(s) and one or more pharmaceutically acceptable or physiologically acceptable diluents, carriers or excipients. In certain embodiments, the IDO inhibitors are present in a therapeutically acceptable amount. The pharmaceutical compositions may be used in the methods of the present invention; thus, for example, the pharmaceutical compositions can be administered ex vivo or in vivo to a subject in order to practice the therapeutic and prophylactic methods and uses described herein.","The pharmaceutical compositions of the present invention can be formulated to be compatible with the intended method or route of administration; exemplary routes of administration are set forth herein. Furthermore, the pharmaceutical compositions may be used in combination with other therapeutically active agents or compounds as described herein in order to treat or prevent the diseases, disorders and conditions as contemplated by the present invention.","The pharmaceutical compositions containing the active ingredient (e.g., an inhibitor of IDO function) may be in a form suitable for oral use, for example, as tablets, capsules, troches, lozenges, aqueous or oily suspensions, dispersible powders or granules, emulsions, hard or soft capsules, or syrups, solutions, microbeads or elixirs. Pharmaceutical compositions intended for oral use may be prepared according to any method known to the art for the manufacture of pharmaceutical compositions, and such compositions may contain one or more agents such as, for example, sweetening agents, flavoring agents, coloring agents and preserving agents in order to provide pharmaceutically elegant and palatable preparations. Tablets, capsules and the like contain the active ingredient in admixture with non-toxic pharmaceutically acceptable excipients which are suitable for the manufacture of tablets. These excipients may be, for example, diluents, such as calcium carbonate, sodium carbonate, lactose, calcium phosphate or sodium phosphate; granulating and disintegrating agents, for example, corn starch, or alginic acid; binding agents, for example, starch, gelatin or acacia, and lubricating agents, for example, magnesium stearate, stearic acid or talc.","The tablets, capsules and the like suitable for oral administration may be uncoated or coated by known techniques to delay disintegration and absorption in the gastrointestinal tract and thereby provide a sustained action. For example, a time-delay material such as glyceryl monostearate or glyceryl distearate may be employed. They may also be coated by techniques known in the art to form osmotic therapeutic tablets for controlled release. Additional agents include biodegradable or biocompatible particles or a polymeric substance such as polyesters, polyamine acids, hydrogel, polyvinyl pyrrolidone, polyanhydrides, polyglycolic acid, ethylene-vinylacetate, methylcellulose, carboxymethylcellulose, protamine sulfate, or lactide\/glycolide copolymers, polylactide\/glycolide copolymers, or ethylenevinylacetate copolymers in order to control delivery of an administered composition. For example, the oral agent can be entrapped in microcapsules prepared by coacervation techniques or by interfacial polymerization, by the use of hydroxymethylcellulose or gelatin-microcapsules or poly(methylmethacrolate) microcapsules, respectively, or in a colloid drug delivery system. Colloidal dispersion systems include macromolecule complexes, nano-capsules, microspheres, microbeads, and lipid-based systems, including oil-in-water emulsions, micelles, mixed micelles, and liposomes. Methods for the preparation of the above-mentioned formulations will be apparent to those skilled in the art.","Formulations for oral use may also be presented as hard gelatin capsules wherein the active ingredient is mixed with an inert solid diluent, for example, calcium carbonate, calcium phosphate, kaolin or microcrystalline cellulose, or as soft gelatin capsules wherein the active ingredient is mixed with water or an oil medium, for example, peanut oil, liquid paraffin, or olive oil.","Aqueous suspensions contain the active materials in admixture with excipients suitable for the manufacture thereof. Such excipients can be suspending agents, for example, sodium carboxymethylcellulose, methylcellulose, hydroxy-propylmethylcellulose, sodium alginate, polyvinyl-pyrrolidone, gum tragacanth and gum acacia; dispersing or wetting agents, for example, a naturally-occurring phosphatide (e.g., lecithin), or condensation products of an alkylene oxide with fatty acids (e.g., polyoxyethylene stearate), or condensation products of ethylene oxide with long chain aliphatic alcohols (e.g., for heptadecaethyleneoxycetanol), or condensation products of ethylene oxide with partial esters derived from fatty acids and a hexitol (e.g., polyoxyethylene sorbitol monooleate), or condensation products of ethylene oxide with partial esters derived from fatty acids and hexitol anhydrides (e.g., polyethylene sorbitan monooleate). The aqueous suspensions may also contain one or more preservatives.","Oily suspensions may be formulated by suspending the active ingredient in a vegetable oil, for example, arachis oil, olive oil, sesame oil or coconut oil, or in a mineral oil such as liquid paraffin. The oily suspensions may contain a thickening agent, for example, beeswax, hard paraffin or cetyl alcohol. Sweetening agents such as those set forth above, and flavoring agents may be added to provide a palatable oral preparation.","Dispersible powders and granules suitable for preparation of an aqueous suspension by the addition of water provide the active ingredient in admixture with a dispersing or wetting agent, suspending agent and one or more preservatives. Suitable dispersing or wetting agents and suspending agents are exemplified herein.","The pharmaceutical compositions of the present invention may also be in the form of oil-in-water emulsions. The oily phase may be a vegetable oil, for example, olive oil or arachis oil, or a mineral oil, for example, liquid paraffin, or mixtures of these. Suitable emulsifying agents may be naturally occurring gums, for example, gum acacia or gum tragacanth; naturally occurring phosphatides, for example, soy bean, lecithin, and esters or partial esters derived from fatty acids; hexitol anhydrides, for example, sorbitan monooleate; and condensation products of partial esters with ethylene oxide, for example, polyoxyethylene sorbitan monooleate.","Formulations can also include carriers to protect the composition against rapid degradation or elimination from the body, such as a controlled release formulation, including implants, liposomes, hydrogels, prodrugs and microencapsulated delivery systems. For example, a time delay material such as glyceryl monostearate or glyceryl stearate alone, or in combination with a wax, may be employed.","The pharmaceutical compositions typically comprise a therapeutically effective amount of an IDO inhibitor contemplated by the present invention and one or more pharmaceutically and physiologically acceptable formulation agents. Suitable pharmaceutically acceptable or physiologically acceptable diluents, carriers or excipients include, but are not limited to, antioxidants (e.g., ascorbic acid and sodium bisulfate), preservatives (e.g., benzyl alcohol, methyl parabens, ethyl or n-propyl, p-hydroxybenzoate), emulsifying agents, suspending agents, dispersing agents, solvents, fillers, bulking agents, detergents, buffers, vehicles, diluents, and\/or adjuvants. For example, a suitable vehicle may be physiological saline solution or citrate buffered saline, possibly supplemented with other materials common in pharmaceutical compositions for parenteral administration. Neutral buffered saline or saline mixed with serum albumin are further exemplary vehicles. Those skilled in the art will readily recognize a variety of buffers that can be used in the pharmaceutical compositions and dosage forms contemplated herein. Typical buffers include, but are not limited to, pharmaceutically acceptable weak acids, weak bases, or mixtures thereof. As an example, the buffer components can be water soluble materials such as phosphoric acid, tartaric acids, lactic acid, succinic acid, citric acid, acetic acid, ascorbic acid, aspartic acid, glutamic acid, and salts thereof. Acceptable buffering agents include, for example, a Tris buffer, N-(2-Hydroxyethyl)piperazine-N\u2032-(2-ethanesulfonic acid) (HEPES), 2-(N-Morpholino)ethanesulfonic acid (MES), 2-(N-Morpholino)ethanesulfonic acid sodium salt (MES), 3-(N-Morpholino)propanesulfonic acid (MOPS), and N-tris[Hydroxymethyl]methyl-3-aminopropanesulfonic acid (TAPS).","After a pharmaceutical composition has been formulated, it may be stored in sterile vials as a solution, suspension, gel, emulsion, solid, or dehydrated or lyophilized powder. Such formulations may be stored either in a ready-to-use form, a lyophilized form requiring reconstitution prior to use, a liquid form requiring dilution prior to use, or other acceptable form. In some embodiments, the pharmaceutical composition is provided in a single-use container (e.g., a single-use vial, ampoule, syringe, or autoinjector (similar to, e.g., an EPIPEN\u00ae)), whereas a multi-use container (e.g., a multi-use vial) is provided in other embodiments. Any drug delivery apparatus may be used to deliver and IDO inhibitor, including implants (e.g., implantable pumps) and catheter systems, slow injection pumps and devices, all of which are well known to the skilled artisan. Depot injections, which are generally administered subcutaneously or intramuscularly, may also be utilized to release the polypeptides disclosed herein over a defined period of time. Depot injections are usually either solid- or oil-based and generally comprise at least one of the formulation components set forth herein. One of ordinary skill in the art is familiar with possible formulations and uses of depot injections.","The pharmaceutical compositions may be in the form of a sterile injectable aqueous or oleagenous suspension. This suspension may be formulated according to the known art using those suitable dispersing or wetting agents and suspending agents mentioned herein. The sterile injectable preparation may also be a sterile injectable solution or suspension in a non-toxic parenterally-acceptable diluent or solvent, for example, as a solution in 1,3-butane diol. Acceptable diluents, solvents and dispersion media that may be employed include water, Ringer's solution, isotonic sodium chloride solution, CREMOPHOR\u00ae EL (BASF, Parsippany, N.J.) or phosphate buffered saline (PBS), ethanol, polyol (e.g., glycerol, propylene glycol, and liquid polyethylene glycol), and suitable mixtures thereof. In addition, sterile, fixed oils are conventionally employed as a solvent or suspending medium. For this purpose any bland fixed oil may be employed, including synthetic mono- or diglycerides. Moreover, fatty acids such as oleic acid, find use in the preparation of injectables. Prolonged absorption of particular injectable formulations can be achieved by including an agent that delays absorption (e.g., aluminum monostearate or gelatin).","The present invention contemplates the administration of the IDO inhibitors in the form of suppositories for rectal administration. The suppositories can be prepared by mixing the drug with a suitable non-irritating excipient which is solid at ordinary temperatures but liquid at the rectal temperature and will therefore melt in the rectum to release the drug. Such materials include, but are not limited to, cocoa butter and polyethylene glycols.","The IDO inhibitors contemplated by the present invention may be in the form of any other suitable pharmaceutical composition (e.g., sprays for nasal or inhalation use) currently known or developed in the future.","The concentration of a polypeptide or fragment thereof in a formulation can vary widely (e.g., from less than about 0.1%, usually at or at least about 2% to as much as 20% to 50% or more by weight) and will usually be selected primarily based on fluid volumes, viscosities, and subject-based factors in accordance with, for example, the particular mode of administration selected.","Routes of Administration","The present invention contemplates the administration of IDO inhibitors, and compositions thereof, in any appropriate manner. Suitable routes of administration include oral, parenteral (e.g., intramuscular, intravenous, subcutaneous (e.g., injection or implant), intraperitoneal, intracisternal, intraarticular, intraperitoneal, intracerebral (intraparenchymal) and intracerebroventricular), nasal, vaginal, sublingual, intraocular, rectal, topical (e.g., transdermal), sublingual and inhalation. Depot injections, which are generally administered subcutaneously or intramuscularly, may also be utilized to release the IDO inhibitors disclosed herein over a defined period of time.","Particular embodiments of the present invention contemplate oral administration.","Combination Therapy","The present invention contemplates the use of IDO inhibitors in combination with one or more active therapeutic agents (e.g., chemotherapeutic agents) or other prophylactic or therapeutic modalities (e.g., radiation). In such combination therapy, the various active agents frequently have different, complementary mechanisms of action. Such combination therapy may be especially advantageous by allowing a dose reduction of one or more of the agents, thereby reducing or eliminating the adverse effects associated with one or more of the agents. Furthermore, such combination therapy may have a synergistic therapeutic or prophylactic effect on the underlying disease, disorder, or condition.","As used herein, \u201ccombination\u201d is meant to include therapies that can be administered separately, for example, formulated separately for separate administration (e.g., as may be provided in a kit), and therapies that can be administered together in a single formulation (i.e., a \u201cco-formulation\u201d).","In certain embodiments, the IDO inhibitors are administered or applied sequentially, e.g., where one agent is administered prior to one or more other agents. In other embodiments, the IDO inhibitors are administered simultaneously, e.g., where two or more agents are administered at or about the same time; the two or more agents may be present in two or more separate formulations or combined into a single formulation (i.e., a co-formulation). Regardless of whether the two or more agents are administered sequentially or simultaneously, they are considered to be administered in combination for purposes of the present invention.","The IDO inhibitors of the present invention may be used in combination with at least one other (active) agent in any manner appropriate under the circumstances. In one embodiment, treatment with the at least one active agent and at least one IDO inhibitor of the present invention is maintained over a period of time. In another embodiment, treatment with the at least one active agent is reduced or discontinued (e.g., when the subject is stable), while treatment with an IDO inhibitor of the present invention is maintained at a constant dosing regimen. In a further embodiment, treatment with the at least one active agent is reduced or discontinued (e.g., when the subject is stable), while treatment with an IDO inhibitor of the present invention is reduced (e.g., lower dose, less frequent dosing or shorter treatment regimen).

In the case of T cells, the ultimate amplitude (e.g., levels of cytokine production or proliferation) and quality (e.g., the type of immune response generated, such as the pattern of cytokine production) of the response, which is initiated through antigen recognition by the T-cell receptor (TCR), is regulated by a balance between co-stimulatory and inhibitory signals (immune checkpoints). Under normal physiological conditions, immune checkpoints are crucial for the prevention of autoimmunity (i.e., the maintenance of self-tolerance) and also for the protection of tissues from damage when the immune system is responding to pathogenic infection. The expression of immune checkpoint proteins can be dysregulated by tumors as an important immune resistance mechanism.","T cells have been the major focus of efforts to therapeutically manipulate endogenous antitumor immunity because of i) their capacity for the selective recognition of peptides derived from proteins in all cellular compartments; ii) their capacity to directly recognize and kill antigen-expressing cells (by CD8+ effector T cells; also known as cytotoxic T lymphocytes (CTLs)); and iii) their ability to orchestrate diverse immune responses by CD4+ helper T cells, which integrate adaptive and innate effector mechanisms. In the clinical setting, the blockade of immune checkpoints\u2014which results in the amplification of antigen-specific T cell responses\u2014has shown to be a promising approach in human cancer therapeutics.","T cell-mediated immunity includes multiple sequential steps, each of which is regulated by counterbalancing stimulatory and inhibitory signals in order to optimize the response. While nearly all inhibitory signals in the immune response ultimately modulate intracellular signaling pathways, many are initiated through membrane receptors, the ligands of which are either membrane-bound or soluble (cytokines). While co-stimulatory and inhibitory receptors and ligands that regulate T-cell activation are frequently not over-expressed in cancers relative to normal tissues, inhibitory ligands and receptors that regulate T cell effector functions in tissues are commonly overexpressed on tumor cells or on non-transformed cells associated with the tumor microenvironment. The functions of the soluble and membrane-bound receptor-ligand immune checkpoints can be modulated using agonist antibodies (for co-stimulatory pathways) or antagonist antibodies (for inhibitory pathways). Thus, in contrast to most antibodies currently approved for cancer therapy, antibodies that block immune checkpoints do not target tumor cells directly, but rather target lymphocyte receptors or their ligands in order to enhance endogenous antitumor activity. [See Pardoll, (April 2012) Nature Rev. Cancer 12:252-64].","Examples of immune checkpoints (ligands and receptors), some of which are selectively upregulated in various types of tumor cells, that are candidates for blockade include PD1 (programmed cell death protein 1); PDL1 (PD1 ligand); BTLA (B and T lymphocyte attenuator); CTLA4 (cytotoxic T-lymphocyte associated antigen 4); TIM3 (T-cell membrane protein 3); LAG3 (lymphocyte activation gene 3); A2aR (adenosine A2a receptor A2aR); and Killer Inhibitory Receptors, which can be divided into two classes based on their structural features: i) killer cell immunoglobulin-like receptors (KIRs), and ii) C-type lectin receptors (members of the type 11 transmembrane receptor family). Other less well-defined immune checkpoints have been described in the literature, including both receptors (e.g., the 2B4 (also known as CD244) receptor) and ligands (e.g., certain B7 family inhibitory ligands such B7-H3 (also known as CD276) and B7-H4 (also known as B7-S1, B7x and VCTN1)). [See Pardoll, (April 2012) Nature Rev. Cancer 12:252-64].","The present invention contemplates the use of the inhibitors of IDO function described herein in combination with inhibitors of the aforementioned immune-checkpoint receptors and ligands, as well as yet-to-be-described immune-checkpoint receptors and ligands. Certain modulators of immune checkpoints are currently available, whereas others are in late-stage development. To illustrate, when it was approved for the treatment of melanoma in 2011, the fully humanized CTLA4 monoclonal antibody ipilimumab (YERVOY; Bristol-Myers Squibb) became the first immune checkpoint inhibitor to receive regulatory approval in the US. Fusion proteins comprising CTLA4 and an antibody (CTLA4-Ig; abatcept (ORENCIA; Bristol-Myers Squibb)) have been used for the treatment of rheumatoid arthritis, and other fusion proteins have been shown to be effective in renal transplantation patients that are sensitized to Epstein Barr Virus. PD1 antibodies are also available for the treatment of cancer, including for example nivolumab (Bristol-Myers Squibb) and pembroluzimab (Merck), and anti-PDL1 antibodies are also being evaluated (e.g., MPDL3280A (Roche)). Nivolumab (Opdivo\u00ae) has shown promise in patients with melanoma, lung and kidney cancer, as well as multiple other malignancies.","In one aspect of the present invention, the claimed IDO inhibitors are combined with an immuno-oncology agent that is (i) an agonist of a stimulatory (including a co-stimulatory) receptor or (ii) an antagonist of an inhibitory (including a co-inhibitory) signal on T cells, both of which result in amplifying antigen-specific T cell responses.

Antibacterial agents can be classified in various manners, including based on mechanism of action, based on chemical structure, and based on spectrum of activity. Examples of antibacterial agents include those that target the bacterial cell wall (e.g., cephalosporins and penicillins) or the cell membrane (e.g., polymyxins), or interfere with essential bacterial enzymes (e.g., sulfonamides, rifamycins, and quinolines). Most antibacterial agents that target protein synthesis (e.g., tetracyclines and macrolides) are bacteriostatic, whereas agents such as the aminoglycoside are bactericidal. Another means of categorizing antibacterial agents is based on their target specificity; \u201cnarrow-spectrum\u201d agents target specific types of bacteria (e.g., Gram-positive bacteria such as ), while \u201cbroad-spectrum\u201d agents have activity against a broader range of bacteria. The skilled artisan is aware of types of anti-bacterial agents that are appropriate for use in specific bacterial infections.","The present invention encompasses pharmaceutically acceptable salts, acids or derivatives of the agents (and members of the classes of agents) set forth above.","Dosing","The IDO inhibitors of the present invention may be administered to a subject in an amount that is dependent upon, for example, the goal of administration (e.g., the degree of resolution desired); the age, weight, sex, and health and physical condition of the subject to which the formulation is being administered; the route of administration; and the nature of the disease, disorder, condition or symptom thereof. The dosing regimen may also take into consideration the existence, nature, and extent of any adverse effects associated with the agent(s) being administered. Effective dosage amounts and dosage regimens can readily be determined from, for example, safety and dose-escalation trials, in vivo studies (e.g., animal models), and other methods known to the skilled artisan.","In general, dosing parameters dictate that the dosage amount be less than an amount that could be irreversibly toxic to the subject (the maximum tolerated dose (MTD)) and not less than an amount required to produce a measurable effect on the subject. Such amounts are determined by, for example, the pharmacokinetic and pharmacodynamic parameters associated with ADME, taking into consideration the route of administration and other factors.","An effective dose (ED) is the dose or amount of an agent that produces a therapeutic response or desired effect in some fraction of the subjects taking it. The \u201cmedian effective dose\u201d or ED50 of an agent is the dose or amount of an agent that produces a therapeutic response or desired effect in 50% of the population to which it is administered. Although the ED50 is commonly used as a measure of reasonable expectance of an agent's effect, it is not necessarily the dose that a clinician might deem appropriate taking into consideration all relevant factors.

A. et al., 56:72-79 (2007). Briefly, all chemicals can be purchased from Sigma-Aldrich (St. Louis, Mo.) unless specified otherwise. Groups of 1,000 human islets can be cultured for 24 h in 1 mL medium with cytokines, recovered by centrifugation for 5 min at 800\u00d7g and sonicated in 150 \u03bcL PBS containing a protease inhibitor cocktail (Set 2; Calbiochem, EMD Biosciences, San Diego, Calif.). The sonicate can be centrifuged for 10 min at 10,000\u00d7g, and the supernatant can be assayed in triplicate by incubating a 40 \u03bcl sample with an equal volume of 100 mmol\/L potassium phosphate buffer, pH 6.5, containing 40 mmol\/L ascorbic acid (neutralized to pH 7.0), 100 \u03bcmol\/L methylene blue, 200 \u03bcg\/mL catalase, and 400 \u03bcmol\/1 L-Trp for 30 min at 37\u00b0 C. The assay can be terminated by the addition of 16 \u03bcL 30% (w\/v) trichloroacetic acid (TCA) and further incubated at 60\u00b0 C. for 15 min to hydrolyze N-formylkynurenine to KYN. The mixture can then be centrifuged at 12,000 rpm for 15 min, and KYN can be quantified by mixing equal volume of supernatant with 2% (w\/v) Ehrlich's reagent in glacial acetic acid in 96-well microtiter plate and reading the absorbance at 480 nm using L-KYN as standard. Protein in the islet samples can be quantified by Bio-Rad Protein assay at 595 nm. For the detection of L-KYN in the islet culture supernatants, proteins can be precipitated with 5% (w\/v) TCA and centrifuged at 12,000 rpm for 15 min, and determination of KYN in the supernatant with Ehrlich's reagent can be determined as described above. IL-4 (10 \u03bcg\/mL; 500-2,000 units\/mL) and 1-\u03b1-methyl Trp (1-MT; 40 \u03bcmol\/L) can be added to the incubation media as indicated. This assay can also form the basis of a cell-based assay, and may be quantified via LCMS\/MS as an alternative to UV\/Vis detection.","Western Blot Analyses. Groups of 1,000-1,200 islets incubated for 24 h in Miami medium in the presence of cytokines can be harvested and sonicated in PBS as above, and 50 \u03bcg protein samples can be electrophoresed on 10% SDS-PAGE gels. COST cells (0.6\u00d710cells\/60 mm3 petri dish) transfected with human-IDO plasmid (3 \u03bcg) or empty vector cells can be used as positive and negative controls, respectively. Proteins can be transferred electrophoretically onto polyvinylidine fluoride membranes by semidry method and blocked for 1 h with 5% (w\/v) nonfat dry milk in Tris-buffered saline and 0.1% Tween and then incubated overnight with anti-human mouse IDO antibody (1:500; Chemicon, Temecula, Calif.), phospho-STATp91, and STATp91 (1:500; Zymed, San Francisco, Calif.). Immunoreactive proteins can be visualized with ECL PLUS\u00ae Western blotting detection reagent (Amersham BioSciences, Buckinghamshire, U.K.) after incubation for 1 h with anti-mouse horseradish peroxidase-conjugated secondary antibody (Jackson Immunolabs, West Grove, Pa.).","Immunohistochemical Detection of IDO. Islets can be fixed in 4% paraformaldehyde in PBS (Invitrogen) for 1 h, immobilized in molten 10% porcine skin gelatin blocks (37\u00b0 C.), and embedded in optimal cutting temperature compound. Immunofluorescent staining on islet tissue can be performed on 7 \u03bcm sections that were stained with antibodies raised against pancreatic duodenal homeobox 1 (PDX1) and IDO. Antigen retrieval can be performed in a water bath for 30 min in a buffer containing 10 mmol\/1 Tris and 1 mmol\/1 EDTA (pH 9.0) at 97\u00b0 C. The sections can be blocked for 1 h with 5% normal goat serum in PBS. The tissues can then be reacted with mouse monoclonal anti-human IDO antibody (1:20; Chemicon) and goat polyclonal anti-human PDX1 antibody (1:2,000; which may be requested from Dr. Chris Wright, School of Medicine, Vanderbilt, Tenn.) overnight at room temperature in a humid chamber. Secondary antibodies anti-goat (labeled with Cy3) and anti-mouse (labeled with Cy2) can be purchased from Jackson Immunolabs and can be used at a concentration of 1:200. The nuclei can be stained with Hoechst 33258 (Molecular Probes, Eugene, Oreg.). Images can be acquired by Intelligent Imaging System software from an Olympus 1X81 inverted motorized microscope equipped with Olympus DSU (spinning disk confocal) and Hamamatsu ORCA IIER monochromatic CCD camera.","Alternative means for evaluating the IDO inhibitors of the present invention are described in WO 2010\/0233166 and are summarized hereafter.","Biochemical Assay. cDNA clones for both human and mouse IDO have been isolated and verified by sequencing and are commercially available. In order to prepare IDO for biochemical studies, C-terminal His-tagged IDO protein can be produced in using the IPTG-inducible pET5a vector system and isolated over a nickel column. The yield of the partially purified protein can be verified by gel electrophoresis and the concentration estimated by comparison to protein standards. To assay IDO enzymatic activity, a 96-well plate spectrophotometric assay for kynurenine production can be run following published procedures (see, e.g., Littlejohn, T. K., et al., 19:22-29 (2000)). To screen for IDO inhibitory activity, compounds can be evaluated at a single concentration of, for example, 200 \u03bcM against 50 ng of IDO enzyme in 100 \u03bcL reaction volumes with tryptophan added at increasing concentrations at, for example, 0, 2, 20, and 200 \u03bcM. Kynurenine production can be measured at 1 hour.","Cell-based Assay. COS-1 cells can be transiently transfected with a CMV promoter-driven plasmid expressing IDO cDNA using Lipofectamine 2000 (Invitrogen) as recommended by the manufacturer. A companion set of cells can be transiently transfected with TDO-expressing plasmid. Forty-eight hours post-transfection, the cells can be apportioned into a 96-well format at 6\u00d710cells per well. The following day, the wells can be washed and new media (phenol red free) containing 20 \u03bcg\/mL tryptophan can be added together with inhibitor. The reaction can be stopped at 5 hours and the supernatant removed and spectrophotometrically-assayed for kynurenine as previously described for the enzyme assay. To obtain initial confirmation of IDO activity, compounds can be evaluated at a single concentration of, for example, 100 \u03bcM. More extensive dose-escalation profiles can be collected for select compounds.","Pharmacodynamic and Pharmacokinetic Evaluation. A pharmacodynamic assay can be based on measuring serum levels of both kynurenine and tryptophan, and calculating the kynurenine\/tryptophan ratio provides an estimate of IDO activity that is independent of baseline tryptophan levels. Serum tryptophan and kynurenine levels can be determined by HPLC analysis, and serum compound levels can optionally also be determined in the same HPLC run.","Compounds can be initially evaluated by challenging mice with LPS and then subsequently administering a bolus dose of compound at the time that the serum kynurenine level plateaus. As the kynurenine pool is rapidly turned over with a half-life in serum of less than 10 minutes, pre-existing kynurenine is not expected to unduly mask the impact that an IDO inhibitor has on kynurenine production. Each experiment can include non-LPS-exposed mice (to determine baseline kynurenine levels against which to compare the other mice) and a set of LPS-exposed mice dosed with vehicle alone (to provide a positive control for IDO activation). Each compound can initially be evaluated in mice at a single high i.p. bolus dose in the range of at least 100 mg\/kg. Blood can be collected at defined time intervals (for example, 50 \u03bcL sample at 5, 15, 30 min., 1, 2, 4, 6, 8, and 24 hr. following compound administration) for HPLC analysis of kynurenine and tryptophan levels (pharmacodynamic analysis) as well as for the level of compound (pharmacokinetic analysis). From the pharmacokinetic data the peak serum concentration of compound achieved can be determined as well as the estimated rate of clearance. By comparing the level of compound in serum relative to the kynurenine\/tryptophan ratio at various time points, the effective ICfor IDO inhibition in vivo can be roughly estimated. Compounds exhibiting efficacy can be evaluated to determine a maximum dose that achieves 100% IDO inhibition at the peak concentration.","The invention is now described with reference to the following Examples.

Treatment of compound IV with triflic anhydride and an organic base such as 2,6-lutidine will afford a vinyl triflate of general structure V. Coupling of V with arylboronic acids or esters E-B(OR), preferably under the conditions of Suzuki (see Kotha, S. et al., 58:9633-9695 (2002)) affords cycloalkenes of general structure VI. Typically, this reaction is performed by heating the halide and the boronic acid or ester to from about 90 to about 98\u00b0 C. with a base such as aqueous tribasic sodium or potassium phosphate or sodium or potassium carbonate in a solvent such as dioxane, DMF, THF, or NMP using a catalyst such as tetrakis(triphenylphosphine)palladium or ClPd(dppf).

Mild conditions have been reported for the coupling of sensitive boronic acid derivatives. See Kinzel, T. et al., 132(40):14073-14075 (2010). Saturation of the olefin in VII can be accomplished by treatment with Pd\/C in an atmosphere of hydrogen to give a compound of general structure VII as a mixture of cis and trans isomers about the carbocycle. Further substitution of the ester can be accomplished by treatment with a strong base, such as LDA or LiHMDS, followed by addition of an electrophile R\u2014X where X is Br or I, to afford compounds of general structure VIII after basic hydrolysis with a base such as LiOH.
