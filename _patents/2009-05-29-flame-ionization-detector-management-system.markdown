title: Flame ionization detector management system
abstract: A method for calibrating a flame ionization detector (FID). The method includes receiving a request to schedule a calibration. After scheduling the calibration, a flow request command is sent to a gas distribution system at a scheduled calibration. The flow request command instructs the gas distribution system to provide a gas at a gas concentration level to the FID. After the gas distribution system provides the gas at the gas concentration level to the FID, the method includes receiving a raw count from the FID and correlating the raw count with the gas and the gas concentration level provided to the FID. The method then stores the results of the correlation in a calibration log.

No. 61\/057,124, filed May 29, 2008, titled BATTERY OPERATED FLAME IONIZATION DETECTOR, which is incorporated herein by reference.","1. Field of the Invention","Implementations of various technologies described herein are directed to flame ionization detectors (FIDs) and to various methods and\/or systems for managing and calibrating the FIDs.","2. Description of the Related Art","The following descriptions and examples do not constitute an admission as prior art by virtue of their inclusion within this section.","Industrial plants that handle volatile organic compounds (VOCs) sometimes experience unwanted emissions of those compounds into the atmosphere from point sources, such as smokestacks, and non-point sources, such as valves, pumps, and\/or vessels containing the VOCs. Emissions from non-point sources typically occur due to leakage of the VOCs from joints and\/or seals and may be referred to herein as \u201cfugitive emissions\u201d. Fugitive emissions from control valves typically occur as leakage through the packing set around the valve stem. Control valves used in demanding service conditions involving large temperature fluctuations and frequent movements of the valve stem commonly suffer accelerated deterioration of the valve stem packing set.","The United States Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) has promulgated regulations specifying a maximum permitted leakage of certain hazardous air pollutants, such as benzene, toluene, 1,1,1-trichloroethane, from certain hardware or fixtures, e.g., control valves. Fugitive emissions are typically monitored using a VOC detector, like a FID, which may also be referred to as a vapor analyzer. Government regulations require that VOC detectors used in the testing of valves and other components in petrochemical processing or manufacturing facilities be calibrated at various intervals. These calibration activities must be documented and made available for inspection for up to five years. If the calibrations are not performed, or if they are performed but not documented, the facility owner can be fined and\/or suffer other regulatory sanctions.","Described herein are implementations of various technologies for automatically managing the calibration and validation of a flame ionization detector (FID). In one implementation, managing the calibration of a FID may include a method for calibrating a flame ionization detector (FID). The method begins by receiving a request to schedule a calibration. After receiving the calibration schedule request, the method may send a flow request command to a gas distribution system at a scheduled calibration. The flow request command may instruct the gas distribution system to provide a gas at a gas concentration level to the FID. After the gas distribution system provides the gas at the gas concentration level to the FID, the method may include receiving a raw count from the FID and correlating the raw count with the gas and the gas concentration level provided to the FID. The method may then store the results of the correlation in a calibration log.","In another implementation, managing the calibration of the FID may include a method for determining whether a calibration event has occurred in the FID. Here, the method may include receiving a calibration log from the FID. The calibration log may describe an identifier of the FID, a scheduled date for the calibration of the FID, a scheduled time for the calibration of the FID, a date in which the calibration of the FID was performed, a time in which the calibration of the FID was performed, a gas supplied during the calibration, a gas concentration level supplied during the calibration, a raw count received during the calibration, and the like. The method may then compare the scheduled date with the date in which the FID was calibrated. If the scheduled date does not match the date in which the FID was calibrated, the method may display a message describing a missed calibration.","In yet another implementation, managing the validation of a FID calibration may include a method for determining whether a validation event has occurred in the FID. As such, the method may receive a validation log from the FID. The validation log may list an identifier of the FID, a scheduled date for the validation of the FID, a scheduled time for the validation of the FID, a date in which the validation of the FID was performed, a time in which the validation of the FID was performed, a gas supplied during the validation, a gas concentration level supplied during the validation, a raw count received during the validation, and the like. The method may then compare the scheduled date with the date in which the FID was validated. If the scheduled date does not match the date in which the FID was validated, the method may then display a message describing a missed validation.","In still another implementation, managing the calibration of a FID may include a method for storing a record about a maintenance performed on the FID. Here, the method may include receiving information about one or more scheduled maintenances to be performed on the FID and receiving a record about the maintenance performed on the FID. After receiving the information and record about the maintenance, the method may then store the record and the information on a maintenance log and send the maintenance log to the FID.","In yet still another implementation, managing the calibration or validation of the FID may include a method for initializing the FID. The method may include sending a first ignition command to the FID to ignite a first ignition source located in a chamber of the FID. After sending the first ignition command, the method may receive a first temperature value of the chamber from a temperature sensor disposed inside the chamber after a predetermined amount of time. If the first temperature value is less than the predetermined temperature value, the method may then include sending a second ignition command to the FID to ignite a second ignition source located in the chamber.","In yet another implementation, a system for managing the calibration of the FID may include a FID and a computer device in communication with the FID. The FID may have a first ignition source and a second ignition source located in a chamber of the FID. The FID may also have a temperature sensor for measuring the temperature inside the chamber. The computer device may include a processor and a memory with program instructions executable by the processor to send a first ignition command to the FID to ignite the first ignition source. The processor may then receive a first temperature value of the chamber from the temperature sensor after a predetermined amount of time. If the first temperature value is less than the predetermined temperature value, the processor may send a second ignition command to the FID to ignite the second ignition source.","In yet another implementation, managing the calibration of a FID may include a method for validating the calibration of the FID. Here, the method may include receiving a request to schedule a validation of the calibration. After receiving the request to schedule the validation, the method may send a flow request command to a gas distribution system to provide a gas at a gas concentration level to the FID at a scheduled validation time. The method may then receive a raw count from the FID. After the raw count is received, the method may determine whether the FID passes the validation. The method may then store the validation result in a validation log.","The above referenced summary section is provided to introduce a selection of concepts in a simplified form that are further described below in the detailed description section. The summary is not intended to identify key features or essential features of the claimed subject matter, nor is it intended to be used to limit the scope of the claimed subject matter. Furthermore, the claimed subject matter is not limited to implementations that solve any or all disadvantages noted in any part of this disclosure.","The discussion below is directed to certain specific implementations. It is to be understood that the discussion below is only for the purpose of enabling a person with ordinary skill in the art to make and use any subject matter defined now or later by the patent \u201cclaims\u201d found in any issued patent herein.","The following paragraphs provide a brief executive summary of one or more implementations of various techniques directed to automatically managing the calibration and validation of a flame ionization detector (FID). In one implementation, the FID calibration and validation management system may include a FID, a Personal Digital Assistant (PDA), a gas distribution system, and a supply of one or more gases.","In operation, an operator may schedule one or more FIDs to be calibrated from a list of FIDs connected to a PDA. The schedule may provide for daily, weekly, or monthly calibrations for some or all of the connected FIDs. The operator may select a set of gases and gas concentration levels for each FID to be calibrated to.","Automatic Calibration","In general, calibration involves providing a gas, e.g., methane, at a specific concentration level into the FID. In one implementation, the FID calibration system may include a FID and a gas distribution system in communication with the PDA. The gas distribution system may provide the gas at a specific concentration level to the FID.","The PDA may be set to send a signal to the FID for any type of calibration (e.g., daily, precision or drift), which may automatically be performed at a predetermined time. At the predetermined time, the PDA may send a signal to the FID to ignite its ignition source, monitor\/confirm the FID's warm-up time, administer calibration gases, perform electronic calibration, test and store all results. The results may be stored in the FID, PDA, and may also be transferred to a computer.","Failsafe Calibration","The PDA may compare an internal calendar with its calibration records and display a notice to the operator when any calibration event (such as daily calibration, quarterly precision calibration or periodic drift assessment) was required but has not been performed. The operator would have the option of setting a calibration requirement in the PDA, overriding the failsafe notice, or disabling other features of the FID until the calibrations are performed. This may provide an assurance that an operator may not inadvertently use a FID that has not been properly calibrated.","Automatic Backup Ignition & Ignition Failure Notice","At the scheduled calibration time, the PDA may send a signal to the FID to ignite its primary ignition source to initiate the warm up period for the FID. If the FID does not heat up to a predetermined temperature value within a certain period of time, the FID may send a failure notification to the PDA. This failure notification may alert the operator to repair the FID's primary ignition source. This failure notification may be displayed repeatedly until repair to the primary ignition source has been completed. The failure notification may also trigger the PDA to send an ignition command to the FID's backup ignition source.","Storing Calibration Log on PDA","The FID may generate a raw \u201ccount\u201d from the gas provided by the gas distribution system and send the result back to the PDA. The PDA may correlate the supplied gas and its concentration level with the resulting \u201ccount\u201d detected by the FID. The correlation may be compiled into a calibration log, which may be stored on the PDA. The calibration log may also be forwarded to the FID which may later forward the calibration log to a monitoring PDA and a main computer. The calibration log may also include an identifier of the supplied gas, the gas concentration level amount, the FID's raw count, and a date indicating when the calibration took place.","Automatic Validation","In one implementation, the operator may also schedule a time for validating the calibration. For instance, the validation of the calibration may be scheduled to immediately follow the calibration process. As such, after completing the calibration process, the FID may be validated to ensure proper detection. Here, the gas distribution system may again provide the gas at the specified concentration level to the FID. The PDA may receive the resultant count from the FID. A gas concentration level may be computed using the existing calibration log. The calibration of the FID detector may be validated by verifying that the gas concentration level amount provided by the gas distribution system is within a predetermined tolerance of the gas concentration level detected by the FID. Readings within the predetermined tolerance may indicate that the FID passes the validation process.","In one implementation, the validation may be based on an average of detected gas concentration levels over several trials. In another implementation, the validation may be based on how much time it takes for the FID detectors to detect the gas concentration level and send the relevant data to the PDA.","Wireless Interface","In one implementation, the FID takes most or all of its input and presents most or all of its output through a wireless interface to the PDA. As such, in this implementation, the FID has few, if any, buttons, displays, switches, keypads or physical interface. This enables the FID to be smaller, lighter, less susceptible to breakage, less expensive and easier to modernize and upgrade.","Storing Maintenance Records on FID","All maintenance records, including repair records, maintenance checks, replacement parts, confirmation of flow rates, quarterly calibration records, battery replacement, and the like, will be stored directly in the FID's onboard computer and in the memory of the PDA. This will enable the owner to have a ready source of all maintenance that has been performed on each FID for its entire lifetime.","FID's Capability to Interface With Multiple PDAs","The FID may be designed to interface with a wide variety of PDAs. This feature may give the owner the flexibility to operate the FID with a PDA that best suits the owner's other requirements.","PDA's Capability To Display Maintenance Needs and Schedules","The PDA may automatically display notices indicating a system malfunction or when a routine or periodic maintenance is required on a FID.","One or more implementations of various techniques in connection with the use of a FID will now be described in more detail with reference to  in the following paragraphs.",{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0038","num":"0037"},"figref":"FIG. 1","b":["100","100","102","104","106","108"]},"The gas sources  may be configured to provide one or more gases to the calibration system . The gas sources  may provide different concentrations of gas through different gas lines  to the gas distribution system . For example, the gas sources  may provide a methane gas with a concentration of 100 parts-per-million (PPM) over a first gas line, a concentration of 550 PPM over a second gas line, 750 PPM over a third gas line, etc. Although various implementations described herein are with reference to methane gas, it should be understood that in some implementations, other types of gas may be used, such as hexane, propane, carbon tetrachloride, and the like.","The gas distribution system  may be configured to facilitate the delivery of gas to the FID . The gas distribution system  may also be referred to as a span box. The gas distribution system  may provide a specific gas concentration to the FID  by routing the gas from one of the gas lines  to the FID  through a FID gas line .","Further, although various implementations are described with reference to a gas distribution system  providing gas to the FID , it should be understood that in some implementations, the gas may be delivered directly to the FID  without use of a gas distribution system . For example, the delivery of the gas to the FID  may be performed manually, using bags, containers, and the like.","The PDA  may be in communication with the gas distribution system  and the FIDs . In one implementation, the gas distribution system  may be coupled to the PDA . Here, the gas distribution system  and the PDA  may communicate with each other via a shared processor. Communication between the PDA  and the gas distribution system  or the FIDs  may occur over wired or wireless connections. In one implementation, the PDA  may communicate with the gas distribution system  and the FIDs  via Bluetooth communications. Although various implementations described herein are with reference to Bluetooth communications, it should be understood that in some implementations, other types of communication methods may be used, such as serial cable, Ethernet cable, the Internet, and the like. The PDA  will be described in more detail in .","The FIDs  may be configured to detect volatile organic chemicals, emissions gases, nitro-aromatics, chemical warfare agents and the like. In one implementation, the FIDs  may use a battery power source so that the FID  may be easily transported to different locations. Further, the FID  may not include a video display or any other input\/output peripherals, thereby decreasing the size of the FID . However, it should be understood that some implementations may provide options for various input\/output modules and\/or power sources. The FID  will be described in more detail in .",{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0044","num":"0043"},"figref":["FIG. 2","FIG. 2"],"b":["200","200","221","222","223","222","221","200","223","222","224","225","226","200","224","228","223"]},"The PDA  may further include a hard disk drive  for reading from and writing to a hard disk. The hard disk drive  may be connected to the system bus  by a hard disk drive interface . The drives and their associated computer-readable media may provide nonvolatile storage of computer-readable instructions, data structures, program modules and other data for the PDA .","The PDA  may include computer-readable media that may be accessed by the CPU . For example, such computer-readable media may include computer storage media and communication media. Computer storage media may include volatile and non-volatile, and removable and non-removable media implemented in any method or technology for storage of information, such as computer-readable instructions, data structures, program modules or other data. Computer storage media may further include RAM, ROM, erasable programmable read-only memory (EPROM), electrically erasable programmable read-only memory (EEPROM), flash memory or other solid state memory technology, CD-ROM, digital versatile disks (DVD), or other optical storage, magnetic cassettes, magnetic tape, magnetic disk storage or other magnetic storage devices, or any other medium which can be used to store the desired information and which can be accessed by the CPU .","The PDA  may contain a communications interface  that may be used to connect with other FIDs . As mentioned above, PDA  may interface with FIDs  via Bluetooth communications. As such, the communications interface  may be a wireless communications interface. However, it should be understood that in some implementations the PDA  may use other types of communications methods.","Communication media may embody computer readable instructions, data structures, program modules or other data in a modulated data signal, such as a carrier wave or other transport mechanism and may include any information delivery media. The term \u201cmodulated data signal\u201d may mean a signal that has one or more of its characteristics set or changed in such a manner as to encode information in the signal. By way of example, and not limitation, communication media may include wired media such as a wired network or direct-wired connection, and wireless media such as acoustic, RF, infrared and other wireless media. Combinations of any of the above may also be included within the scope of computer readable media.","A number of program modules may be stored on ROM  or RAM , including an operating system , a calibration application , and a validation application . The operating system  may be any suitable operating system that may control the operation of a networked personal or server computer, such as Windows\u00ae XP, Mac OS\u00ae X, Unix-variants (e.g., Linux\u00ae and BSD\u00ae), and the like.

As shown in , the wireless communications interface  is integrated with the FID . The wireless communications interface  may include a receiver, a transceiver or any other device that would enable the FID  to communicate wirelessly with the PDA. In one implementation, the wireless communications interface  may include a wireless chip. The wireless communication facilitated by the wireless communications interface  may be Bluetooth, WiFi, FM and the like. As such, the wireless communications interface  enables the FID  to communicate wirelessly with the PDA without the use of an adapter. Although the FID  has been described to communicate with other devices using a wireless communications interface, it should be noted that the FID  may also be capable of communicating with other devices via a wired communications interface as well.","A number of program modules may be stored on the system memory  including the FID calibration application  and the FID validation application . Each of these program modules will be described in more detail with reference to  in the paragraphs below. In addition to the program modules stored on the system memory , the FID  may also store the calibration log  and the maintenance record log  in the system memory . The calibration log  may include information pertaining to the one or more calibrations that may have been performed on the FID . The information in the calibration log  may include the time and date of a calibration, the gas used in each calibration, the gas concentration level used for each calibration, and the raw count received for each gas and its corresponding gas concentration level.

Thus, various technologies, or certain aspects or portions thereof, may take the form of program code (i.e., instructions) embodied in tangible media, such as floppy diskettes, CD-ROMs, hard drives, or any other machine-readable storage medium wherein, when the program code is loaded into and executed by a machine, such as a computer, the machine becomes an apparatus for practicing the various technologies. In the case of program code execution on programmable computers, the computing device may include a processor, a storage medium readable by the processor (including volatile and non-volatile memory and\/or storage elements), at least one input device, and at least one output device. One or more programs that may implement or utilize the various technologies described herein may use an application programming interface (API), reusable controls, and the like.

In a distributed computing environment, program modules may be located in both local and remote computer storage media including memory storage devices.",{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0056","num":"0055"},"figref":"FIG. 4","b":["400","400","236"]},"At step , the calibration application  may receive a request to schedule a calibration for one or more FIDs  that may be connected to the PDA . In one implementation, the operator may schedule one or more dates and\/or times in which the FID  may be calibrated by entering in one or more dates and\/or times in which the calibrations may take place. The operator may schedule a calibration for every day or once a week. For example, the operator may schedule a calibration to occur every Friday for each FID  connected to the PDA . The calibration application  may also receive a gas type and a corresponding gas concentration level to be used for the scheduled calibration. Accordingly, the operator using the PDA  may select one or more of the gas sources  and a corresponding gas concentration level to use for calibrating each FID  selected at step .","At step , at the scheduled time received at step , e.g., every Friday at 4:00 a.m., the calibration application  may send a calibration mode command to the FID  that may have been scheduled to be calibrated at step . The calibration mode command may trigger the FID calibration application  to initiate the calibration process for the FID  by sending a command to the primary ignition source  to ignite a flame within the chamber. After a predetermined period of time, the FID calibration application  may receive a temperature value of the chamber from the temperature sensor . In one implementation, the FID calibration application  may periodically receive the temperature value of the chamber from the temperature sensor . If the FID calibration application  receives a temperature value below a predetermined temperature value within a predetermined amount of time, the FID calibration application  may send a failure notification to the PDA . The failure notification may indicate that the primary ignition source  may require maintenance. In one implementation, in conjunction with sending the failure notification to the PDA , the FID calibration application  may also send a command to the backup ignition source  to ignite a flame within the chamber.
