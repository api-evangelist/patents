{"@attributes":{"id":"description"},"BRFSUM":[{},{}],"heading":["BACKGROUND","SUMMARY","DETAILED DESCRIPTION"],"p":["Currently, www.onlinelawyersource.com states that \u201cAuto accident fatalities are the leading cause of death for young people in America. Teenagers comprise less than 7% of the total population but are involved in 14% of all auto accidents.\u201d The article further states that research by Ford Motor Company revealed that teenage drivers are four times more distracted when using a cell phone compared to adult drivers. Further statistics reveal that 80% of teens have cell phones, 48% of teens admit talking on cell phones while driving and 61% admit to texting while driving.","Teen cell phone and mobile device usage while driving adversely affects the bottom line of insurance companies in the form of loss due to preventable accidents. To combat automobile accidents caused by inattentive drivers many states have, and are currently passing, legislation illegalizing the use of cell phones while driving.","Currently, no systems or methods exist to help insurance companies accurately assign a risk premium associated with mobile device usage while driving to those who carry out this dangerous activity such that no risk premium is assigned unduly to those who are not guilty of the activity.","In this regard, there is a need for systems and methods that overcome the shortcomings described above and others.","This summary is provided to introduce a selection of concepts in a simplified form that are further described below in the Detailed Description.

Currently, many networks are coupled to the Internet, which provides an infrastructure for widely distributed computing and encompasses many different networks. Any such infrastructures, whether coupled to the Internet or not, may be used in conjunction with the systems and methods provided.","A network infrastructure may enable a host of network topologies such as client\/server, peer-to-peer, or hybrid architectures. The \u201cclient\u201d is a member of a class or group that uses the services of another class or group to which it is not related. In computing, a client is a process, i.e., roughly a set of instructions or tasks, that requests a service provided by another program. The client process utilizes the requested service without having to \u201cknow\u201d any working details about the other program or the service itself.

Instead, the embodiments should be construed in breadth and scope in accordance with the appended claims.","Referring next to  shown is a block diagram of an example system  for providing a financial transaction based on data received from systems and methods for automatically disabling mobile device usage while driving. Shown are a network , a mobile switching center , a service provider , and a plurality of example customers   . The mobile switching center , service provider , and plurality of example customers    are all operably connected to each other through the network  such that they may be in remote communication with each other.

A mobile device as described herein may include, but is not limited to, one or a combination of the following types of wireless devices: cellular phone, smart phone, satellite phone, personal digital assistant (PDA), mobile computing devices, handheld computers, and other mobile communication devices.","The network  may be one or a combination of the following types of networks: computer communications network, the Internet, an intranet, data communications network, close or long range wireless network, satellite network, cellular network, telephone network, radio network, etc. The system  may be used to provide a plurality of financial transactions including but not limited to banking transactions, investment transactions; insurance transactions and a plurality of other financial transactions. The provider may be a financial services provider such as an Integrated Financial Services company, for example, or anyone performing banking, investing, financial or insurance transactions for customers   . The plurality of customers    may be operably connected to the network  via their data input and communication devices, including mobile devices. One or more of the customers    may have a personal computer or mobile device connected to the network  such as the Internet, in order to facilitate communications between the customers    and the provider . For example, data from systems and methods for automatically disabling mobile device usage while driving may be received from the mobile switching center  (or from the customers directly   ) through the network  to the provider . For example, this data may include, but is not limited to information regarding whether and when the customers    were driving over a predetermined speed or driving while operating their mobile device.","Referring next to , shown is a block diagram of the example services provider  in the system of  for providing a financial transaction based on data received from systems and methods for automatically disabling mobile device usage while driving. The provider  may comprise a customer communications engine  connected to the network  of  (e.g., the Internet) via network connections  operable for sending and receiving data to and from customers   . The payment management engine  may have access to customer accounts in customer information database  via the customer communications engine  in order to perform financial transactions. The payment management engine  may also have access to business rules in business database  for performing financial transactions. Both the customer information database  and business database  may receive information via network connections  from systems and methods for automatically disabling mobile device usage while driving via the mobile switching center  (or from the customers directly   ) through the network . For example, this data may include, but is not limited to information regarding whether and when the customers    were driving over a predetermined speed or driving while operating their mobile device.","Referring next to , shown is a flowchart illustrating an example process for restricting mobile device functionality according to systems and methods for automatically disabling mobile device usage while driving. The process may monitor output from an accelerometer on or inside a mobile device of a customer. An accelerometer is a device for measuring acceleration and gravity and velocity. Single and multi-axis models are available to detect magnitude and direction of the acceleration as a vector quantity, and can also be used to sense orientation, vibration and shock. Accelerometers are increasingly present in portable electronic devices (such as mobile devices) and video game controllers. An accelerometer measures the acceleration and gravity it experiences typically expressed in SI units meters\/second2 (m\/s2) or popularly in terms of g-force. Velocity can therefore be measured by detecting an initial acceleration up to detecting deceleration in the opposite direction. Conceptually, an accelerometer behaves as a damped mass on a spring. When the accelerometer experiences an external force such as gravity, the mass is displaced until the external force is balanced by the spring force. The displacement is translated into acceleration.","Modern accelerometers are often small micro electro-mechanical systems (MEMS), and are indeed the simplest MEMS devices possible, consisting of little more than a cantilever beam with a proof mass (also known as seismic mass). Damping results from the residual gas sealed in the device. As long as the Q-factor is not too low, damping does not result in a lower sensitivity.","Under the influence of external accelerations the proof mass deflects from its neutral position. This deflection is measured in an analog or digital manner. Most commonly, the capacitance between a set of fixed beams and a set of beams attached to the proof mass is measured. This method is simple, reliable, and inexpensive. Integrating piezoresistors in the springs to detect spring deformation, and thus deflection, is a good alternative, although a few more process steps are needed during the fabrication sequence. For very high sensitivities quantum tunneling is also used; this requires a dedicated process making it very expensive. Optical measurement has been demonstrated on laboratory scale.","Another, far less common, type of MEMS-based accelerometer contains a small heater at the bottom of a very small dome, which heats the air inside the dome to cause it to rise. A thermocouple on the dome determines where the heated air reaches the dome and the deflection off the center is a measure of the acceleration applied to the sensor.","Most micromechanical accelerometers operate in-plane, that is, they are designed to be sensitive only to a direction in the plane of the die. By integrating two devices perpendicularly on a single die a two-axis accelerometer can be made. By adding an additional out-of-plane device three axes can be measured. Such a combination always has a much lower misalignment error than three discrete models combined after packaging. Micromechanical accelerometers are available in a wide variety of measuring ranges, reaching up to thousands of g's. The designer must make a compromise between sensitivity and the maximal acceleration that can be measured.","When the monitoring program determines  from the accelerometer output that the mobile device's velocity exceeds a pre-established threshold, it is then determined  whether there is a current transmission on the mobile device in progress (e.g., a phone call in progress). If there is not a current transmission in progress, it is then determined  whether transmissions are already disabled. If transmissions are already disabled, then the process ends  with leaving the transmissions disabled.","If there is a transmission in progress, then a warning is given  (such as playing an audio warning clip) that transmissions are about to be disabled. This warning may be played on the mobile device, for example, and may give the customer a predetermined time to end the transmission (e.g., end the phone call) before automatically disabling  transmissions. The disabling of transmission may be performed via an internal switch triggered within the mobile device to shut off particular communications, or may be performed at the mobile switching center  by intercepting or blocking certain types of transmissions from the mobile device at the mobile switching center . The mobile switching center  (shown in ) is then updated as to the status of the customer's mobile device and other data regarding whether and when the customer was driving over a predetermined speed or driving while operating their mobile device may also be communicated to the mobile switching center . If there is not a transmission in progress and transmissions are not already disabled on the device then a warning message may be displayed  on the mobile device warning that transmission is about to be disabled and thereafter transmissions will be automatically disabled  as above. The disabling of transmissions may include disabling certain functionality on the mobile device including one or more of the following types of functionality: voice, text messaging, e.g., short message service (SMS), multimedia messaging service (MMS), email, web browsing, chat functionality, video playback, sound, camera functionality, airplane mode, mobile device power, all mobile device functionality. Also, a message may be automatically relayed to a person calling or sending other communications to the mobile device indicating that the customer is driving or otherwise busy and cannot respond if transmissions are currently disabled.","The process above may be stored in memory and operate on a processor within the mobile device, for example, and further embodiments may disable voice and text operations via a permission function called by the send command on the mobile device that would only allow the send command to operate if the current speed of the mobile device is not over a predetermined threshold. In a further embodiment a call to \u2018911\u2019 would be allowed by the permission function and in the process described above","Referring next to , shown is a flowchart illustrating an example process for restoring mobile device functionality according to systems and methods for automatically disabling mobile device usage while driving. First, the accelerometer in or on the mobile device detects  the mobile device is at a speed less than a predetermined speed threshold. It is then determined  whether transmissions are currently enabled on the device. If transmissions are currently enabled, then the process ends , leaving the transmissions enabled. If transmissions are not currently enabled, then transmissions are enabled  on the device and a notification message is displayed  indicating transmissions are enabled or restored. The mobile switching center  (shown in ) is then updated  as to the status of the customer's mobile device and other data regarding whether and when the customer was driving over a predetermined speed or driving while operating their mobile device may also be communicated to the mobile switching center .","In one embodiment, the accelerometer included in the device architecture of the mobile device notifies the Mobile Telephone Switching Office (MTSO)  (i.e., mobile switching center) when the device is traveling faster than a specified threshold velocity. In this embodiment the MTSO includes a flag in the frequency usage transaction record indicating that the device was traveling at, or beyond, a threshold speed limit. In the present embodiment a provider insurance company  may retrieve customer call records from the MTSO  and other data including, but not limited to information regarding whether and when the customer was driving over a predetermined speed or driving while operating their mobile device. This data may be used in an automobile insurance premium adjustment of the customer. For example, this automobile insurance premium adjustment may be effected automatically via the payment management engine  shown . Also, discovery of calls while traveling may be used in automobile insurance premium adjustment. Likewise, the MTSO may notify the customer's automobile insurance company that the customer was using a cell phone in a moving vehicle and the customer mobile device may notify the customer's automobile insurance company server via SMS or mail exchange server, for example.","In a further embodiment, detection of mobile device in moving vehicles may be accomplished through Mobile Switching Center (MSC) Visitor Location Registry (VLR) entries. In this embodiment, cell usage while driving would be identifiable via analyzing location data against usage time data. Location data may be obtained through a global positioning system (GPS) on the device or other methods of location such as triangulation.","In a further embodiment, a method may allow law enforcement to discover if the driver of an automobile was communicating via a mobile device while driving before being pulled over or at the time of a vehicle accident. Law enforcement may be notified of cell phone use in a vehicle with GPS coordinates in order to apprehend the driver violating cell phone usage laws.","In an embodiment, a customer may purchase, lease, or rent an accelerometer governed phone for use by a dependent of driving age. In return for proof of usage (e.g. billing records) the customer may receive a premium discount on the dependent's automobile insurance policy. In an embodiment phone service payment through a company sponsored \u201cWeb Bill Pay\u201d program may suffice as proof of usage. The premium discount is rewarded for accelerometer governed phone usage as it effectively reduces the potential of voice and\/or data transmission on the part of the dependent driver while operating a moving vehicle. Research indicates that by preventing teenage customer voice and\/or data transmission while driving will reduce the losses incurred as a result of teenage involved automobile accidents.","Referring next to , shown is a diagram of an example mobile device  before having its usage disabled as described above according to systems and methods for automatically disabling mobile device usage while driving. Note that the display of the mobile device  shows icons for the phone , text messaging  and email  functionality as being operational.","Referring next to , shown is a diagram of an example mobile device  which has had its usage disabled as described above according to systems and methods for automatically disabling mobile device usage while driving. Note that the display of the mobile device  shows the icons for the phone , text messaging  and email  functionality as being disabled by images    each comprising a circle with a line through it and a lock image over the phone , text messaging  and email  icons. However, other indications and images may be displayed to indicating certain functionality or features on the mobile device have been disabled.","Referring next to , shown is a diagram illustrating the communication to the mobile device from a vehicle once a driver of the vehicle has put the key in the ignition of the vehicle according to systems and methods for automatically disabling mobile device usage while driving. Shown are a vehicle key , the vehicle key  being inserted into the ignition  of an automobile, a mobile device , and a wireless communication signal  being sent to the mobile device  upon insertion of the key  into the ignition . The wireless communication signal  may be a signal to the mobile device  to initiate or active the procedures for monitoring of the speed of the mobile device  as described above via an accelerometer on or in the mobile device  and subsequent disabling of mobile device  functionality as described above if the speed of the mobile device exceeds a predetermined threshold. In this way, the customer or user of the mobile device will not have its functionality disabled when riding in taxis, airplanes, public transportation and in others' automobiles. The mobile device  may be programmed to recognize particular signals from particular vehicles or particular keys  using identifiers within the signal indicating which vehicle or key  the signal is originating from. For example, the signal may be sent via a radio frequency identifier chip embedded within the key  or vehicle that is triggered to transmit once to the key is inserted into the vehicle ignition  (e.g. via an electrical contact being made between the key  and the vehicle ignition ). Also, if the automobile is started using electronic authentication means such as a code being entered or received by the vehicle, reception of the code to start the vehicle may also trigger the transmission of the signal  to the mobile device  to initiate the procedures for monitoring of the speed of the mobile device  as described above.","It is noted that the foregoing examples have been provided merely for the purposes of explanation and are in no way to be construed as limiting of the present invention.
