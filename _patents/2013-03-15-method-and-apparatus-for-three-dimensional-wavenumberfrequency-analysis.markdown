The Government has certain rights in this invention.","The present invention relates to wavenumber-frequency analysis. Particularly, the present invention relates to wavenumber-frequency analysis in three dimensions.","Systems for receiving and analyzing sound signals, for example, undersea sonar systems, utilize multiple transducers in a variety of configurations to receive and process sound signals from the environment. Detected sounds may indicate the presence of a friendly or enemy vessel. Sound signatures associated with each type of sound may be used to correlate the detected sound and aid in identifying its source. In addition to the sound signals associated with a particular target, other sound sources emit signals that may be received by the transducers. For example, the sound of water flowing past the sonar array, or vibrations from structural elements within the array, may generate sound waves that are also detectable by the sonar array. These sound signals are referred to as self-noise. Self-noise interferes with the straightforward identification of target sounds and therefore should be identified and removed from the overall signals received.","The presence of self noise may compromise the ability to effectively detect remote targets. Structural and flow self-noise often travel at sub-sonic speeds (i.e. less than the speed of sound in water). One aspect of wavenumber-frequency (k\u03c9) analysis allows for the separation of sub-sonic noise sources from sonic noise sources. Sub-sonic noise sources may be identified by their propagation characteristics or a known acoustic signature. Accurate identification of the self-noise sources allows for compensation or remediation of the noise, enabling better identification of target sounds.","One and two dimensional wavenumber-frequency analysis provides limited information on self-noise sound sources. One-dimensional k\u03c9 analysis is utilized for linear sonar arrays, for example, a towed linear array or a segment of a curved array using a linear approximation. However, one-dimensional k\u03c9 analysis only accounts for the kcomponent of k and the frequency. Thus the kand kcomponents remain unaccounted for. The lack of these k components result in ambiguities with respect to the direction of arrival of a detected self-noise sound source. Similarly, in two-dimensional k\u03c9 analysis, only the kand kcomponents of k are accounted for. Thus, ambiguities with respect to the kcomponent of k are extant.","Alternative techniques for identifying self-noise and resolving problems associated with the identification of self noise within an overall received signal containing information associated with a target of interest, is desirable.","A sensor array configured to receive wave data in three dimensions comprises a plurality of sensors for receiving wave data. Each sensor may be referenced by the sensor's coordinate position on the array, represented by a position vector. A time based Fourier transform is performed on data samples from each sensor. A spatial Fourier transform then computes spatial wavenumber-frequency spectra as a function of the received wave data in three dimensions to account for the wavenumber's orthogonal components, k, k, and kassociated with the x, y and z orthogonal axes, respectively.","A sonar array for providing three dimensional sensor data comprises a plurality of sensors disposed on a surface of the three dimensional sonar array, the surface defining a geometric surface area; a processor configured to: receive data from each of the plurality of sensors; compute a position vector for each of the plurality of sensors based on a coordinate position of each sensor in three dimensions with respect to the geometric surface area; compute a time Fourier transform on time samples received from each sensor; compute a spatial Fourier transform based in part on the calculated position vectors; and output the results of the spatial Fourier transform.","A method of computing wavenumber-frequency spectra comprises accounting for the wavenumber's x, y and z orthogonal axis directional components. A position vector is computed based on a sensor's position relative to the sensor array. A time based Fourier transform is performed on data samples from each sensor, and a spatial Fourier transform is performed on the data samples accounting for a position vector for each sensor. Explicit inclusion of k, where the z-axis is along the axis of the sensor array enables direction of arrival of incoming waves to be determined in all three spatial dimensions, and provides enhanced and unambiguous target localization and source signature characterization.","Sensor arrays have been developed to enhance reception of signals directed toward the array. For example, in sonar systems used on ships, an array of sensors, each sensor comprising a transducer containing at least one hydrophone, are arranged in a manner which enhances the array's ability to detect sound in the water. Sensors in a sonar array may be arranged in a number of different configurations. For example, sensors may be arranged in a linear or rectangular (planar) configuration. Alternatively, sensors may be disposed along the surface of a circular array, often with the direction of receiving beams from the sensors radiating out from the circles' center and outward from the sensors. This allows for detection of target sounds in the plane containing the circular array. In addition to linear and circular arrays, cylindrical array geometries are also used. A cylindrical array may be formed by vertically stacking a series of circular arrays on top of one another. The sensors of each ring may be aligned in the vertical direction to form a cylindrical array having rows and columns of sensors across the cylindrical surface of the array.","Referring now to , there is shown an example of a cylindrical array  comprised of a plurality of sensors . Sensors  are arranged as a group of circular array  components. In this example, the cylindrical array  is comprised of eight circular array  components. Within each circular array  component there exists a plurality of sensors . By way of example, each circular array  component may be comprised of 72 sensors . It is understood that other configurations and numbers of sensors  are contemplated by one skilled in the art and would fall within the scope of the present invention.","Each sensor  of the cylindrical array  receives signals in the form of wave energy transmitted in the medium in which the cylindrical array  is located. For example, for array  configured as a sonar array, sound wave energy transmitted through the water is sensed by the sensors  in the array . Certain sound waves detected by the sensors  may be associated with a potential target, such as an enemy ship or submarine. However, in addition to sound waves emanating from such target sources, other sound wave energy may be detected by sensors . For example, sound wave energy relating to the sound of water flowing past the array  may be detected by some or all of the sensors . Other sound energy, such as vibrating energy associated with a structural component of the array , may be detected by the one or more sensors . These non-target sound sources are called self-noise. In order to accurately identify target sounds, self-noise must be detected, identified and accounted for.","Wavenumber-frequency (k\u03c9) analysis is one technique utilized to compensate for self-noise. The wavenumber (k) of a sound wave is defined as the number of wavelengths per unit distance, or the spatial frequency of the wave. Frequency represents the number of wavelengths per unit time, or the temporal frequency of the wave. By analyzing the wavenumber and the frequency of a received wave signal, the speed of propagation may also be determined. In a linear implementation performing k\u03c9 using the cylindrical array , a subset of sensors  may be chosen from which to take samples. In one example, the subset of sensors  are arranged in a vertical linear configuration  along the axis of the cylindrical array . One sensor from each circular array  component is selected such that the eight selected sensors  are arranged in a vertical linear configuration . In another embodiment, a subset of adjacent sensors  contained in the same circular array  component may be considered to form a horizontal linear configuration  (which may also be treated as a linear array). Although the sensors  in the horizontal linear configuration  are disposed along an arc segment of circular array  component, using a small number of sensors  approximates a linear array. By implementing one-dimensional wavenumber-frequency analysis on the data received by the linear array, sounds may be identified relating to a linear beam of reception defined by the line of the sensors  of interest. However when using the one-dimensional approach, the distance and direction cannot be determined due to ambiguities inherent in the one-dimensional k\u03c9 analysis.","A circular version of the k\u03c9 analysis in two-dimensions has been developed which provides a spatial transform of received signals in the kand kcomponents of the wavenumber vector. However, a two-dimensional analysis does not provide a vertical component of the wavenumber and thus continues to introduce ambiguities. For example, if one considers the cylindrical array , two-dimensional circular array k\u03c9 analysis requires certain assumptions be made. For example, one of the circular array  components may be considered to be representative of all other circular array  components. Alternatively, each of the sensors in each of the vertical linear configurations  may be summed to create a virtual single circular array  that is an average of all of the circular array  components.",{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0021","num":"0020"},"figref":["FIG. 2","FIG. 2"],"b":["201","100","201","101","201","101","203","205","207","100"]},"A method of k\u03c9 processing explicitly including the z axis component of a sound source  is shown in .

Post processing may include algorithms on the data itself, or simply convert the data into an image to aid in data interpretation and analysis. Images may be 2D or 3D. 3D images may include transparency options to allow probing the 3D volume of wavenumber space. As an example, an image showing \u201chotspots\u201d in 3D wavenumber space indicates the x, y and z components of the wavevector for the given analysis frequency.","Referring now to , a graphical representation of the results of 3D cylindrical k\u03c9 processing according to an embodiment of the present invention is shown. Here a simulated test plane wave signal at 1500 Hz is assigned a particular direction of propagation, and the wave is directed toward a cylindrical sonar array in a simulated water medium with sound speed c. The k\u03c9 analysis shown is for this 1500 Hz frequency. In the 3D k\u03c9 volume, a single hotspot representing this wave should appear in a 3D image of the magnitude of the frequency-wavenumber spectrum. Also, this hotspot should lie on the surface of an \u201cacoustic sphere\u201d which, for freely propagating waves defines k, kand kcomponents supported by the medium. The acoustic sphere defines valid wavenumber components for all possible directions of wave propagation; for a single wave freely traveling in a particular direction, the k, kand kare unique. depicts a slice of the 3D k\u03c9 spectrum in the y and z dimensions with kfixed. Similarly, is a slice of the 3D k\u03c9 spectrum in the x and z dimensions for fixed k. is a slice of the 3D k\u03c9 spectrum the x and y dimensions for fixed k; this slice in x and y is identical to the 2D circular k\u03c9 spectrum result.","Hotspots are seen at each of the 2D plots (, , and ). These hotspots lie on acoustic circles ,  and , which depict wavenumber components which are valid for freely propagating plane waves. (The acoustic circles are slices through the surface of the 3D acoustical sphere which appears in 3D space.) The three distinct hotspots in the three 2D plots are in fact the same single hotspot that appears in 3D space and it can be inferred that this hotspot intersects the surface of the acoustic sphere, as expected for this propagating wave simulation. The distinct k, k, and kvalues associated with this hotspot are clearly identified in these 2D plots. These values agree with the k, k, and kcomponents of the simulated wave, and therefore the complete 3D characteristics of the simulated wave have been accurately identified. The result is an unambiguous detection of the test wave in all three dimensions.","The relationship between wavenumber and frequency may also be used to determine the propagation speed of the medium in the vicinity of the array. Additionally, sound speed for self-noise sources which often travel and subsonic sound speeds (i.e. less than the speed of sound) can be assessed. One embodiment of the present invention provides comprehensive information relating to the wavenumber properties of a detected wave, thereby allowing for precise determination of propagation speed. Knowing the sound speed is useful for several reasons. For example, knowing the sound speed of the medium allows optimal time delays (or phase shifts) to be derived for beamformers. By knowing the acoustic signature and propagation characteristics of a sound source, it is easier to identify noise source problems such as self noise.  is an exemplary architecture for implementing the processing according to embodiments of the present invention. Sonar array  provides for three dimensional sensor data in communication with transceiver  via communication path  and with beamformer  via path .

The wavenumber for plane waves may be computed using k=\u221a{square root over (k+k+k)}.
