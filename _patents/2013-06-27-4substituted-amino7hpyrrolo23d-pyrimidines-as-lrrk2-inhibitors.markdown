{"@attributes":{"id":"description"},"RELAPP":[{},{}],"p":["This application is a Non-Provisional application, which claims the benefit of U.S. Provisional Patent Application No. 61\/820,828, filed on May 8, 2013 and U.S. Provisional Patent Application No. 61\/666,299, filed on Jun. 29, 2012, the disclosures of which are hereby incorporated by reference in their entirety.","The present invention relates to small molecule inhibitors of leucine-rich repeat kinase 2 (LRRK2). This invention also relates to methods of inhibiting, in mammals, including humans, LRRK2 by administration of the small molecule LRRK2 inhibitors. The present invention also relates to the treatment of Parkinson's Disease (PD) and other neurodegenerative and\/or neurological disorders in mammals, including humans with the LRRK2 inhibitors. More particularly, this invention relates to 4-(substituted-amino)-7H-pyrrolo[2,3-d]pyrimidine compounds useful for the treatment of neurodegenerative and\/or neurological disorders, such as PD, Alzheimer's Disease (AD) and other LRRK2 associated disorders.","LRRK2 is a 286 kDa active protein kinase in the ROCO protein family with a complex multidomain structure and which has structural homology to the MAP kinase kinase kinases (MAPKKK). LRRK2 has been shown to phosphorylate moeisin (at Thr), ezrin and radixin in vitro. LRRK2 has been found in various regions of the brain as well as in the heart, lung, spleen and kidney. Independent domains that have been established for the LRRK2 protein include an ankyrin-like (ANK) domain, a leucine-rich repeat (LRR) domain, a Ras (renin-angiotensin system) of complex (ROC) domain, a C-terminal of ROC(COR) domain, a kinase (Kinase) domain and a C-terminal WD40 domain. The ROC domain binds guanosine triphosphate (GTP) and the COR domain may be a regulator of the ROC domain's GTPase activity.","With multiple domains and both active kinase and guanosine triphosphatase (GTPase) activity, LRRK2 appears to play a complex role in multiple cellular processes. For example, LRRK2 has been associated with NFAT inhibition in the immune system and has been linked to vesicle trafficking, presynaptic homeostasis, mammalian target of rapamycin (mTOR) signaling, signaling through the receptor tyrosine kinase MET in papillary renal and thyroid carcinomas, cytoskeletal dynamics, the mitogen-activated protein kinase (MAPK) pathway, the tumor necrosis factor-\u03b1 (TNF-\u03b1) pathway, the Wnt pathway and autophagy. Recent genome-wide association (GWA) genetic studies have implicated LRRK2 in the pathogenesis of various human diseases such as PD, inflammatory bowel disease (Crohn's disease), cancer and leprosy (Lewis, P. A. and Manzoni, C. Science Signaling 2012, 5(207), pe2).","Parkinson's Disease is a relatively common age-related neurodegenerative disorder resulting from the progressive loss of dopamine-producing neurons and which affects up to 4% of the population over 80. PD is characterized by both motoric and non-motoric symptoms such as tremor at rest, rigidity, akinesia and postural instability as well as non-motor symptoms such as impairment of cognition, sleep and sense of smell. Genome-wide association studies have linked LRRK2 to PD and many patients with point mutations in LRRK2 present symptoms that are indistinguishable from those with idiopathic PD. Over 20 LRRK2 mutations have been associated with autosomal-dominant parkinsonism, and the R1441C, R1441G, R1441H, Y1699C, G2019S, 12020T and N1437H missense mutations are considered to be pathogenic. The LRRK2 R1441G mutation has been shown to increase the release of proinflammatory cytokines (higher levels of TNF-\u03b1, IL-1\u03b2, IL-12 and lower levels of IL-10) in microglial cells from transgenic mice and thus may result in direct toxicity to neurons (Gillardon, F. et al. Neuroscience 2012, 208, 41-48). In a murine model of neuroinflammation, induction of LRRK2 in microglia was observed and inhibition of LRRK2 kinase activity with small molecule LRRK2 inhibitors (LRRK2-IN-1 or sunitinib) or LRRK2 knockout resulted in attenuation of TNF-\u03b1 secretion and nitric oxide synthase (iNOS) induction (Moehle, M. et al. J. Neurosci. 2012, 32(5), 1602-1611). The most common of the LRRK2 mutations, G2019S, is present in more than 85% of PD patients carrying LRRK2 mutations. This mutation, which is present in the LRRK2 kinase domain, leads to an enhancement of LRRK2 kinase activity. In the human brain LRRK2 expression is highest in the same regions of the brain that are impacted by PD, and LRRK2 is found in Lewy Bodies, a hallmark of PD. Recent studies indicate that a potent, selective, brain-penetrant kinase inhibitor for LRRK2 could be a therapeutic treatment for PD.","Dementia results from a wide variety of distinctive pathological processes. The most common pathological processes causing dementia are AD, cerebral amyloid angiopathy (CM) and prion-mediated diseases (see, e.g., Haan et al., Clin. Neurol. Neurosurg. 1990, 92(4):305-310; Glenner et al., J. Neurol. Sci. 1989, 94:1-28). AD is a progressive, neurodegenerative disorder characterized by memory impairment and cognitive dysfunction. AD affects nearly half of all people past the age of 85, the most rapidly growing portion of the United States population. As such, the number of AD patients in the United States is expected to increase from about 4 million to about 14 million by 2050. LRRK2 mutations have been associated with AD-like pathology, which suggests that there may be a partial overlap between the neurodegenerative pathways in both AD and PD (Zimprach, A. et al. Neuron 2004, 44, 601-607). In addition, the LRRK2 R1628P variant (COR domain) has been associated with an increased incidence of AD in a certain population, perhaps resulting from increased apoptosis and cell death (Zhao, Y. et al.; Neurobiology of Aging 2011, 32, 1990-1993.","An increased incidence of certain non-skin cancers such as renal, breast, lung and prostate cancers, as well as acute myelogenous leukemia (AML), has been reported in Parkinson's disease patients with the LRRK2 G2019S mutation (Saunders-Pullman, R. et al.; Movement Disorders, 2010, 25(15), 2536-2541). Since the G2019S mutation is associated with increased LRRK2 kinase activity, inhibition of this activity may be useful in the treatment of cancer, such as kidney, breast, lung, prostate and blood cancers.","Inflammatory bowel disease (IBD) or Crohn's disease (CD) is a complex disease and is believed to result from an inappropriate immune response to microbiota in the intestinal tract. Genome-wide association studies have recently identified LRRK2 as a major susceptibility gene for Crohn's disease, particularly the M2397T polymorphism in the WD40 domain (Liu, Z. et al. Nat. Immunol. 2011, 12, 1063-1070). In a recent study LRRK2 deficient mice were found to be more susceptible to dextran sodium sulfate induced colitis than their wild-type counterparts, indicating that LRRK2 may play a role in the pathogenesis of IBD (Liu, Z. and Lenardo, M.; Cell Research 2012, 1-3).","Both non-selective and selective small molecule compounds with LRRK2 inhibitory activity such as staurosporine, sunitinib, LRRK2-IN-1, CZC-25146, TAE684 and those in WO 2011\/141756, WO 2012\/028629 and WO 2012\/058193 have been described. It is desirable to provide compounds which are potent and selective inhibitors of LRRK2 with a favorable pharmacokinetic profile and the ability to traverse the blood brain barrier. Accordingly, the present invention is directed to novel 4-(substituted-amino)-7H-pyrrolo[2,3-d]pyrimidine compounds with LRRK2 inhibitory activity and the use of these compounds in the treatment of diseases associated with LRRK2, such as neurodegenerative diseases, including PD.","A first embodiment of a first aspect of the present invention is a compound of Formula I",{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0013","num":"0011"},"chemistry":{"@attributes":{"id":"CHEM-US-00002","num":"00002"},"img":{"@attributes":{"id":"EMI-C00002","he":"25.74mm","wi":"54.53mm","file":"US09156845-20151013-C00002.TIF","alt":"embedded image","img-content":"chem","img-format":"tif"}}},"br":{},"sup":["1 ","2 ","6","1 ","2 ","7","3 ","9 ","4 ","5 ","6 ","a","b","a","b","7 ","a","b","a","b","7 ","8","8 ","a","b","9 ","2","a ","b "],"sub":["1","6","3","7","1","6","3","7","5","6","1","6","1","3","1","3","1","6","1","6","1","6","1","3","1","3","3","7","1","3","1","3","2","2","2","1","3","1","3","1","6","3","7","1","6"]},"A second embodiment of a first aspect of the present invention is the compound of the first embodiment of the first aspect wherein Rand Rare each hydrogen;

The term \u201cheterocycloalkyl\u201d refers to a substituent obtained by removing a hydrogen from a saturated or partially saturated ring structure containing the specified number of ring atoms, wherein at least one of the ring atoms is a heteroatom (i.e., oxygen, nitrogen, or sulfur), with the remaining ring atoms being independently selected from the group consisting of carbon, oxygen, nitrogen, and sulfur. If the heterocycloalkyl substituent is in turn substituted with a group or substituent, the group or substituent may be bound to a nitrogen heteroatom, or it may be bound to a ring carbon atom, as appropriate.

A five to six membered heteroaryl is an aromatic ring system which has five or six ring atoms with at least one of the ring atoms being N, O or S. Similarly, a five to ten membered heteroaryl is an aromatic ring system which has five to ten ring atoms with at least one of the ring atoms being N, O or S.

Each substituent therefore may be identical to or different from the other substituent(s).","As used herein the term \u201cformula I\u201d or \u201cFormula I\u201d may be referred to as a \u201ccompound(s) of the invention.\u201d Such terms are also defined to include all forms of the compound of formula I, including hydrates, solvates, isomers, crystalline and non-crystalline forms, isomorphs, polymorphs, and metabolites thereof. For example, the compounds of the invention, or pharmaceutically acceptable salts thereof, may exist in unsolvated and solvated forms. When the solvent or water is tightly bound, the complex will have a well-defined stoichiometry independent of humidity. When, however, the solvent or water is weakly bound, as in channel solvates and hygroscopic compounds, the water\/solvent content will be dependent on humidity and drying conditions. In such cases, non-stoichiometry will be the norm.","The compounds of the invention may exist as clathrates or other complexes. Included within the scope of the invention are complexes such as clathrates, drug-host inclusion complexes wherein the drug and host are present in stoichiometric or non-stoichiometric amounts. Also included are complexes of the compounds of the invention containing two or more organic and\/or inorganic components which may be in stoichiometric or non-stoichiometric amounts. The resulting complexes may be ionized, partially ionized, or non-ionized. For a review of such complexes, see J. Pharm. Sci., 64 (8), 1269-1288 by Haleblian (August 1975).","The compounds of the invention may have asymmetric carbon atoms. The carbon-carbon bonds of the compounds of the invention may be depicted herein using a solid line (), a solid wedge (), or a dotted wedge (). The use of a solid line to depict bonds to asymmetric carbon atoms is meant to indicate that all possible stereoisomers (e.g., specific enantiomers, racemic mixtures, etc.) at that carbon atom are included. The use of either a solid or dotted wedge to depict bonds to asymmetric carbon atoms is meant to indicate that only the stereoisomer shown is meant to be included. It is possible that compounds of Formula I may contain more than one asymmetric carbon atom. In those compounds, the use of a solid line to depict bonds to asymmetric carbon atoms is meant to indicate that all possible stereoisomers are meant to be included. For example, unless stated otherwise, it is intended that the compounds of Formula I can exist as enantiomers and diastereomers or as racemates and mixtures thereof. The use of a solid line to depict bonds to one or more asymmetric carbon atoms in a compound of Formula I and the use of a solid or dotted wedge to depict bonds to other asymmetric carbon atoms in the same compound is meant to indicate that a mixture of diastereomers is present.","Stereoisomers of Formula I include cis and trans isomers, optical isomers such as R and S enantiomers, diastereomers, geometric isomers, rotational isomers, conformational isomers, and tautomers of the compounds of the invention, including compounds exhibiting more than one type of isomerism; and mixtures thereof (such as racemates and diastereomeric pairs). Also included are acid addition or base addition salts wherein the counterion is optically active, for example, D-lactate or L-lysine, or racemic, for example, DL-tartrate or DL-arginine.","When any racemate crystallizes, crystals of two different types are possible. The first type is the racemic compound (true racemate) referred to above wherein one homogeneous form of crystal is produced containing both enantiomers in equimolar amounts. The second type is the racemic mixture or conglomerate wherein two forms of crystal are produced in equimolar amounts each comprising a single enantiomer.","The present invention comprises the tautomeric forms of compounds of the invention. Where structural isomers are interconvertible via a low energy barrier, tautomeric isomerism (\u2018tautomerism\u2019) can occur. This can take the form of proton tautomerism in compounds of the invention containing, for example, an imino, keto, or oxime group, or so-called valence tautomerism in compounds which contain an aromatic moiety. It follows that a single compound may exhibit more than one type of isomerism. The various ratios of the tautomers in solid and liquid form is dependent on the various substituents on the molecule as well as the particular crystallization technique used to isolate a compound.","The compounds of this invention may be used in the form of salts derived from inorganic or organic acids. Depending on the particular compound, a salt of the compound may be advantageous due to one or more of the salt's physical properties, such as enhanced pharmaceutical stability in differing temperatures and humidities, or a desirable solubility in water or oil. In some instances, a salt of a compound also may be used as an aid in the isolation, purification, and\/or resolution of the compound.","Where a salt is intended to be administered to a patient (as opposed to, for example, being used in an in vitro context), the salt preferably is pharmaceutically acceptable. The term \u201cpharmaceutically acceptable salt\u201d refers to a salt prepared by combining a compound of formula I with an acid whose anion, or a base whose cation, is generally considered suitable for human consumption. Pharmaceutically acceptable salts are particularly useful as products of the methods of the present invention because of their greater aqueous solubility relative to the parent compound. For use in medicine, the salts of the compounds of this invention are non-toxic \u201cpharmaceutically acceptable salts.\u201d Salts encompassed within the term \u201cpharmaceutically acceptable salts\u201d refer to non-toxic salts of the compounds of this invention which are generally prepared by reacting the free base with a suitable organic or inorganic acid.","Suitable pharmaceutically acceptable acid addition salts of the compounds of the present invention when possible include those derived from inorganic acids, such as hydrochloric, hydrobromic, hydrofluoric, boric, fluoroboric, phosphoric, metaphosphoric, nitric, carbonic, sulfonic, and sulfuric acids, and organic acids such as acetic, benzenesulfonic, benzoic, citric, ethanesulfonic, fumaric, gluconic, glycolic, isothionic, lactic, lactobionic, maleic, malic, methanesulfonic, trifluoromethanesulfonic, succinic, toluenesulfonic, tartaric, and trifluoroacetic acids. Suitable organic acids generally include, for example, aliphatic, cycloaliphatic, aromatic, araliphatic, heterocyclic, carboxylic, and sulfonic classes of organic acids.","Specific examples of suitable organic acids include acetate, trifluoroacetate, formate, propionate, succinate, glycolate, gluconate, digluconate, lactate, malate, tartaric acid, citrate, ascorbate, glucuronate, maleate, fumarate, pyruvate, aspartate, glutamate, benzoate, anthranilic acid, stearate, salicylate, p-hydroxybenzoate, phenylacetate, mandelate, embonate (pamoate), methanesulfonate, ethanesulfonate, benzenesulfonate, pantothenate, toluenesulfonate, 2-hydroxyethanesulfonate, sufanilate, cyclohexylaminosulfonate, \u03b2-hydroxybutyrate, galactarate, galacturonate, adipate, alginate, butyrate, camphorate, camphorsulfonate, cyclopentanepropionate, dodecylsulfate, glycoheptanoate, glycerophosphate, heptanoate, hexanoate, nicotinate, 2-naphthalesulfonate, oxalate, palmoate, pectinate, 3-phenylpropionate, picrate, pivalate, thiocyanate, and undecanoate.","Furthermore, where the compounds of the invention carry an acidic moiety, suitable pharmaceutically acceptable salts thereof may include alkali metal salts, i.e., sodium or potassium salts; alkaline earth metal salts, e.g., calcium or magnesium salts; and salts formed with suitable organic ligands, e.g., quaternary ammonium salts. In another embodiment, base salts are formed from bases which form non-toxic salts, including aluminum, arginine, benzathine, choline, diethylamine, diolamine, glycine, lysine, meglumine, olamine, tromethamine and zinc salts.","Organic salts may be made from secondary, tertiary or quaternary amine salts, such as tromethamine, diethylamine, N,N\u2032-dibenzylethylenediamine, chloroprocaine, choline, diethanolamine, ethylenediamine, meglumine (N-methylglucamine), and procaine. Basic nitrogen-containing groups may be quaternized with agents such as lower alkyl (C-C) halides (e.g., methyl, ethyl, propyl, and butyl chlorides, bromides, and iodides), dialkyl sulfates (i.e., dimethyl, diethyl, dibutyl, and diamyl sulfates), long chain halides (e.g., decyl, lauryl, myristyl, and stearyl chlorides, bromides, and iodides), arylalkyl halides (e.g., benzyl and phenethyl bromides), and others.","In one embodiment, hemisalts of acids and bases may also be formed, for example, hemisulfate and hemicalcium salts.","Also within the scope of the present invention are so-called \u201cprodrugs\u201d of the compound of the invention. Thus, certain derivatives of the compound of the invention which may have little or no pharmacological activity themselves can, when administered into or onto the body, be converted into the compound of the invention having the desired activity, for example, by hydrolytic cleavage. Such derivatives are referred to as \u201cprodrugs.\u201d Further information on the use of prodrugs may be found in \u201cPro-drugs as Novel Delivery Systems, Vol. 14, ACS Symposium Series (T. Higuchi and V. Stella) and \u201cBioreversible Carriers in Drug Design,\u201d Pergamon Press, 1987 (ed. E. B. Roche, American Pharmaceutical Association). Prodrugs in accordance with the invention can, for example, be produced by replacing appropriate functionalities present in the compounds of any of formula I with certain moieties known to those skilled in the art as \u201cpro-moieties\u201d as described, for example, in \u201cDesign of Prodrugs\u201d by H. Bundgaard (Elsevier, 1985).","The present invention also includes isotopically labeled compounds, which are identical to those recited in formula I, but for the fact that one or more atoms are replaced by an atom having an atomic mass or mass number different from the atomic mass or mass number usually found in nature. Examples of isotopes that can be incorporated into compounds of the present invention include isotopes of hydrogen, carbon, nitrogen, oxygen, phosphorus, sulfur, fluorine and chlorine, such as H, H, C, C, C, N, O, O, P, S, F, and Cl, respectively. Compounds of the present invention, prodrugs thereof, and pharmaceutically acceptable salts of said compounds or of said prodrugs which contain the aforementioned isotopes and\/or other isotopes of other atoms are within the scope of this invention. Certain isotopically labeled compounds of the present invention, for example those into which radioactive isotopes such as H and C are incorporated, are useful in drug and\/or substrate tissue distribution assays. Tritiated, i.e., H, and carbon-14, i.e., C, isotopes are particularly preferred for their ease of preparation and detectability. Further, substitution with heavier isotopes such as deuterium, i.e., H, can afford certain therapeutic advantages resulting from greater metabolic stability, for example increased in vivo half-life or reduced dosage requirements and, hence, may be preferred in some circumstances. Isotopically labeled compounds of formula I of this invention and prodrugs thereof can generally be prepared by carrying out the procedures disclosed in the Schemes and\/or in the Examples and Preparations below, by substituting a readily available isotopically labeled reagent for a non-isotopically labeled reagent.","Typically, a compound of the invention is administered in an amount effective to treat a condition as described herein. The compounds of the invention are administered by any suitable route in the form of a pharmaceutical composition adapted to such a route, and in a dose effective for the treatment intended. Therapeutically effective doses of the compounds required to treat the progress of the medical condition are readily ascertained by one of ordinary skill in the art using preclinical and clinical approaches familiar to the medicinal arts.","The term \u201ctreating\u201d, as used herein, unless otherwise indicated, means reversing, alleviating, inhibiting the progress of, or preventing the disorder or condition to which such term applies, or one or more symptoms of such disorder or condition. The term \u201ctreatment\u201d, as used herein, unless otherwise indicated, refers to the act of treating as \u201ctreating\u201d is defined immediately above. The term \u201ctreating\u201d also includes adjuvant and neo-adjuvant treatment of a subject.","The compounds of the invention may be administered orally. Oral administration may involve swallowing, so that the compound enters the gastrointestinal tract, or buccal or sublingual administration may be employed, by which the compound enters the blood stream directly from the mouth.","In another embodiment, the compounds of the invention may also be administered directly into the blood stream, into muscle, or into an internal organ.

In one embodiment, dosing is from 0.01 to 10 mg\/kg\/day. In another embodiment, dosing is from 0.1 to 1.0 mg\/kg\/day. Dosage unit compositions may contain such amounts or submultiples thereof to make up the daily dose. In many instances, the administration of the compound will be repeated a plurality of times in a day (typically no greater than 4 times). Multiple doses per day typically may be used to increase the total daily dose, if desired.","For oral administration, the compositions may be provided in the form of tablets containing from about 0.01 mg to about 500 mg of the active ingredient, or in another embodiment, from about 1 mg to about 100 mg of active ingredient.

Alternatively, pharmaceutically acceptable salts are suitable for medical applications because of their greater aqueous solubility relative to the parent compound.","In another embodiment, the present invention comprises pharmaceutical compositions. Such pharmaceutical compositions comprise a compound of the invention presented with a pharmaceutically acceptable carrier. The carrier can be a solid, a liquid, or both, and may be formulated with the compound as a unit-dose composition, for example, a tablet, which can contain from 0.05% to 95% by weight of the active compounds. A compound of the invention may be coupled with suitable polymers as targetable drug carriers. Other pharmacologically active substances can also be present.","The compounds of the present invention may be administered by any suitable route, preferably in the form of a pharmaceutical composition adapted to such a route, and in a dose effective for the treatment intended.

In another embodiment, the oral dose form is sub-lingual, such as, for example, a lozenge. In such solid dosage forms, the compounds of formula I are ordinarily combined with one or more adjuvants. Such capsules or tablets may contain a controlled-release formulation. In the case of capsules, tablets, and pills, the dosage forms also may comprise buffering agents or may be prepared with enteric coatings.","In another embodiment, oral administration may be in a liquid dose form. Liquid dosage forms for oral administration include, for example, pharmaceutically acceptable emulsions, solutions, suspensions, syrups, and elixirs containing inert diluents commonly used in the art (e.g., water).

Compositions for topical administration also include, for example, topical gels, sprays, ointments, and creams. A topical formulation may include a compound which enhances absorption or penetration of the active ingredient through the skin or other affected areas. When the compounds of this invention are administered by a transdermal device, administration will be accomplished using a patch either of the reservoir and porous membrane type or of a solid matrix variety. Typical formulations for this purpose include gels, hydrogels, lotions, solutions, creams, ointments, dusting powders, dressings, foams, films, skin patches, wafers, implants, sponges, fibers, bandages and microemulsions. Liposomes may also be used. Typical carriers include alcohol, water, mineral oil, liquid petrolatum, white petrolatum, glycerin, polyethylene glycol and propylene glycol.

Sci., 88 (10), 955-958, by Finnin and Morgan (October 1999).","Formulations suitable for topical administration to the eye include, for example, eye drops wherein the compound of this invention is dissolved or suspended in a suitable carrier. A typical formulation suitable for ocular or aural administration may be in the form of drops of a micronized suspension or solution in isotonic, pH-adjusted, sterile saline. Other formulations suitable for ocular and aural administration include ointments, biodegradable (e.g., absorbable gel sponges, collagen) and non-biodegradable (e.g., silicone) implants, wafers, lenses and particulate or vesicular systems, such as niosomes or liposomes. A polymer such as cross-linked polyacrylic acid, polyvinyl alcohol, hyaluronic acid, a cellulosic polymer, for example, (hydroxypropyl)methyl cellulose, hydroxyethyl cellulose, or methyl cellulose, or a heteropolysaccharide polymer, for example, gelan gum, may be incorporated together with a preservative, such as benzalkonium chloride.

Formulations suitable for intranasal administration are typically administered in the form of a dry powder (either alone, as a mixture, for example, in a dry blend with lactose, or as a mixed component particle, for example, mixed with phospholipids, such as phosphatidylcholine) from a dry powder inhaler or as an aerosol spray from a pressurized container, pump, spray, atomizer (preferably an atomizer using electrohydrodynamics to produce a fine mist), or nebulizer, with or without the use of a suitable propellant, such as 1,1,1,2-tetrafluoroethane or 1,1,1,2,3,3,3-heptafluoropropane. For intranasal use, the powder may comprise a bioadhesive agent, for example, chitosan or cyclodextrin.","In another embodiment, the present invention comprises a rectal dose form. Such rectal dose form may be in the form of, for example, a suppository.

Referring to Scheme 1, compounds of Formula 1-1 and 1-2 [wherein X is a leaving group such as Br or I, and Pg is a suitable protecting group, such as 2-(trimethylsilyl)ethoxymethyl (SEM), p-toluenesulfonyl (tosyl) or tert-butoxycarbonyl (BOC)] are commercially available or can be made by methods described herein or other methods well known to those skilled in the art.","A compound of Formula 1-3 can be prepared by coupling a compound of Formula 1-1 with a compound of Formula 1-2, for example, by heating a mixture of a compound of Formula 1-1 with a compound of Formula 1-2 in the presence of a base, such as N,N-diisopropylethylamine, in an appropriate solvent, such as n-butanol, at temperatures ranging between 50\u00b0 C. and 200\u00b0 C. Suitable reaction times are typically from 20 minutes to 48 hours. Alternatively, a metal-catalyzed (such as using a palladium or copper catalyst) coupling may be employed to accomplish the aforesaid coupling. In this variant of the coupling, a mixture of a compound of Formula 1-1 and a compound of Formula 1-2 can be heated at temperatures ranging between 50\u00b0 C. and 120\u00b0 C. in the presence of a base [such as cesium carbonate], a metal catalyst [such as a palladium catalyst, e.g., palladium(II) acetate], and a ligand [such as 1,1\u2032-binaphthalene-2,2\u2032-diylbis(diphenylphosphane) (BINAP)] in an appropriate solvent, such as 1,4-dioxane. Suitable reaction times are typically from 30 minutes to 48 hours.","A compound of Formula 1-3 can subsequently be reacted with a compound of Formula R-M [wherein M can be B(OH); B(OR)wherein each R is independently H or Calkyl, or wherein two (OR) groups, together with the B atom to which they are attached, form a 5- to 10-membered heterocyclic ring optionally substituted with one or more Calkyl; a trialkyltin moiety; or the like] by a metal-catalyzed (such as using a palladium catalyst) coupling reaction to obtain a compound of Formula 1-4. Compounds of Formula R-M are commercially available or can be prepared by methods analogous to those described in the chemical art. Alternatively, a compound of Formula 1-3 can be converted to a compound of Formula 1-5 [wherein M is defined as above]. A compound of Formula 1-5 can then be reacted with a compound of Formula R\u2014X [wherein X is defined as above] by a metal-catalyzed (such as using a palladium catalyst) coupling reaction to obtain a compound of Formula I. Compounds of Formula R\u2014X are commercially available or can be prepared by methods analogous to those described in the chemical art. The type of reaction employed depends on the selection of X and M. For example, when X is halogen or triflate and the R-M reagent is a boronic acid or boronic ester, a Suzuki reaction may be used [A. Suzuki, 1999, 576, 147-168; N. Miyaura and A. Suzuki, 1995, 95, 2457-2483; A. F. Littke et al., 2000, 722, 4020-4028]. Alternatively, when X is halogen or triflate and M is trialkyltin, a Stille coupling may be employed [V. Farina et al., 1997, 50, 1-652].

Aliquots (3.5 \u03bcL) of the 100% DMSO dose response were mixed with 46.5 \u03bcL water then 1 \u03bcL of this mixture was added to the 3 \u03bcL substrate mix in the 384-well plate. The kinase reaction was started with 3 \u03bcL of a working solution of LRRK2 enzyme at a concentration of 4 \u03bcg\/mL. The final reaction concentrations were 100 nM LRRKtide, 50 \u03bcM ATP, 1.7 \u03bcg\/mL LRRK2 enzyme and a compound dose response with a top dose of 32 \u03bcM. The reaction was allowed to progress at room temperature for two hours and then stopped with the addition of 7 \u03bcL of detection buffer (20 mM Tris pH 7.6, 0.01% NP-40, 0.02% NaN, 6 mM EDTA with 2 nM terbium labeled anti-phospho-ERM). After an incubation of 1 hour at room temperature, the plate was read on an Envision with an excitation wavelength of 340 nm and a reading emission at both 520 nm and 495 nm. The ratio of the 520 nm and 495 nm emission was used to analyze the data.","Inhibition of mutant G2019S LRRK2 (Invitrogen cat #PV4881) was measured in the exact same method. All final concentrations of substrate ATP and enzyme were the same. However, since the mutant enzyme is more active the reaction time was reduced to 90 minutes to ensure that inhibition was measured at steady state before any substrate depletion could occur.","Table 2, below, provides the LRRK2 ICdata for the compounds of the invention.",{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0268","num":"0532"},"tables":{"@attributes":{"id":"TABLE-US-00002","num":"00002"},"table":{"@attributes":{"frame":"none","colsep":"0","rowsep":"0","pgwide":"1"},"tgroup":[{"@attributes":{"align":"left","colsep":"0","rowsep":"0","cols":"4"},"colspec":[{"@attributes":{"colname":"1","colwidth":"35pt","align":"center"}},{"@attributes":{"colname":"2","colwidth":"175pt","align":"left"}},{"@attributes":{"colname":"3","colwidth":"35pt","align":"center"}},{"@attributes":{"colname":"4","colwidth":"28pt","align":"center"}}],"thead":{"row":[{"entry":"TABLE
