The parties to the joint research agreement were Virginia Polytechnic Institute & State University and the United States Air Force (U.S. Government).","Methods of modulating the magnetic field in micron-sized magnetic sensors have been disclosed for example in U.S. Pat. No. 6,501,268. U.S. Pat. No. 7,898,247 discloses a method based on using a rotating disc containing flux concentrators and guides which can be used with a larger sensor, but the motion of the rotating disk generates considerable acoustic noise. Fluxgate magnetometers operate using a similar principle to the one described here in that they drive magnetic material (in the case of a fluxgate a magnetic core) into and out of saturation.","Magnetoelectric magnet field sensors are disclosed in U.S. Pat. No. 7,023,206 to Viehland, et al., (hereinafter Viehland '206) issued Apr. 4, 2006, entitled \u201cMagnetoelectric Magnetic Field Sensor with Longitudinally Biased Magnetostrictive Layer,\u201d hereby incorporated by reference. Viehland '206 discloses a magnetoelectric magnetic field sensor having one or more laminated magnetostrictive layers and piezoelectric layers. The magnetostrictive layers are magnetized by a bias magnetic field in a longitudinal, in-plane direction. The piezoelectric layers can be poled in the longitudinal direction or perpendicular direction. For example, an L-P configuration represents a longitudinal MS magnetization combined with perpendicular PZ poling. Perpendicular poling of the piezoelectric layers tends to provide higher sensitivity at lower detection frequency (e.g. less than 1 Hz). Longitudinal poling tends to provide higher sensitivity at high detection frequency (e.g. above 10 Hz). Also disclosed in Viehland '206 are embodiments having relative thicknesses for the magnetostrictive layers that are optimized for sensitivity. Further examples of a magnetoelectric sensor are disclosed in U.S. Pat. No. 7,771,846 to Veihland, et al., (Viehland '846) hereby incorporated by reference. Viehland '846 discloses a magnetoelectric composite laminate of at least one (1-3) piezo-fiber layer coupled with high-permeability alloy magnetostrictive layers formed of FeBSiC or equivalent. The composite laminate alternates the (1-3) piezo-fiber and high-permeability alloy magnetostrictive layers in a stacked manner with the magnetization direction of the high-permeability alloy magnetostrictive layers and polarization direction of the piezo-fiber layer being in an longitudinal-longitudinal (L-L) arrangement. Optionally, thin film polymer layers are between the (1-3) piezo-fiber layer and high-permeability alloy magnetostrictive layers. Optionally, piezo-electric fibers within the (1-3) piezo-fiber layer are poled by inter-digitated electrodes supported by the thin film polymer, arranged as alternating symmetric longitudinally-poled \u201cpush-pull\u201d units.","There is a need for better performance of sensors, such as for example magnetoelectric magnetic field sensors, at low frequencies to detect weapons systems, vehicles, and, in general, ferromagnetic objects. Also, there is a need for improved magnetic sensors that can be use for controlling manufacturing processes, checking that the hearts of unborn babies for proper functioning, and, if nanomagnets are included as part of a drug, monitoring drug circulation through the bodies of patients.","The present invention is directed to a field modulation technique that increases the operating frequency of magnetoelectric (ME) sensors so that it has the capability of matching the mechanical resonance frequency of the sensor or alternatively solely increases the operating frequency. The resulting improvement reduces the effect of 1\/f noise that is inherent at low frequencies and may also improve the sensitivity by operating at the resonant frequency, where the sensor has a larger response. This technique, which is shown to apply to both symmetric and asymmetric ME sensors, relies on the strong, nonlinear magnetic field dependence of the magnetostriction. The combination of a lower 1\/f noise and the capability of enhanced response at resonance has increased the signal to noise ratio of a symmetric sensor by two orders of magnitude and lowered its detection limit to 7 pT\/\u221a{square root over (Hz)} at 1 Hz in a magnetically unshielded environment.","A preferred embodiment comprises a magnetoelectric sensor assembly  comprising three magnetic materials as shown in . The layers may comprise magnetostrictive material (such as Metglas\u00ae) layer , a biasing ferromagnetic material , and a piezoelectric material . The assembly  may optionally comprise flux concentrators  and . The ferromagnetic material layer  provides a bias field for the magnetostrictive material and is optional. The embodiment of  is asymmetric in that it has a Metglas\u00ae layer positioned on one side of the ferromagnetic material , and a piezoelectric layer  on the opposite side of ferromagnetic layer .","As shown in , the preferred embodiment assembly  comprises at least one coil  positioned as shown. When two coils are used, both coils have their field direction along the sense direction of the sensor. At least one or more coils  can be used to apply a DC field to bias the sensor; which affords the opportunity to remove the bias layer  from the assembly . An AC magnetic field that is large enough in magnitude is used to drive one or several of the magnetic components of the sensor into and out of a region of increased magnetic response at a frequency f. Alternately to coils, a magnet(s) parallel to the sensor can be repeatedly cycled at fto different positional offsets from the sensor. The stray fields will have a DC bias component and an AC field component at f. In all instances, the modulating frequency operates to modulate the amplitude of the signal output of the sensor (the sensed signal). When the components, e.g., the flux concentrator (,), the biasing layer , and\/or the magnetostrictive material (Metglas\u00ae) layer , are in the region of increased magnetic response, the sensor will be much less sensitive. Thus, either the field sensed due to changing the flux concentrator will be modulated at for the output amplitude of the sensor will be modulated at fif the biasing magnet or magnetostrictive material is driven into and out of their region of increased magnetic response. In any case, the operating frequency of the sensor will be increased to higher frequencies; reducing 1\/f noise inversely proportional to frequency. A further possible advantage is that one can increase the frequency to particular frequencies where some sensors are more sensitive. Magnetoelectric sensors have increased sensitivity at their mechanical resonant frequency modes f. For example, when detecting a low frequency signal f, the coil is driven at fsidebands appear at f\u00b1f. The modulation frequency fcan be picked for driving the magnetic material into and out of saturation so that one of the sidebands is at the resonant frequency, i.e.,\n\nf=f\u2212for f=f+f\u2003\u2003(1)\n","An example of this is shown in , wherein sideband  (occurring at resonant frequency of 138.70 hertz is shown. The sidebands are proportional to the sensed signal. Specifically, the amplitude of each sideband is proportional to the intensity of the sensed (or measured) signal. Thus, measurements may be obtained or derived using the sidebands.","Another preferred embodiment modulating magnetic field sensor device may comprise a base; a magnetic sensor operatively associated with the base structure for sensing a magnetic field; at least one coil for creating a magnetic field around the magnetic sensor; at least one coil adapted to be connected to an alternating current source; whereby alternating current passing through the coil operates to modulate the magnetic field at the magnetic sensors and shift the frequency of the magnetic field that is sensed by the magnetic sensors to a higher frequency to thereby minimize 1\/f-type noise, where f is the frequency of operation of the magnetic sensor. Optionally, the device may comprise a flux concentrator on one side or both sides of said magnetic sensor.","Another preferred embodiment magnetoelectric sensor A comprises two layers comprising a magnetostrictive material, such as, Metglas\u00ae  surrounding a piezoelectric material . The biasing ferromagnet layer  may be positioned as shown in  or a secondary DC coil may be used as explained in the following. The embodiment of  is symmetric in that the magnetostrictive material layers are positioned on both sides of the piezoelectric material .","The invention further comprises a method of operating a magnetic sensor comprising at least one coil around the magnetic sensor; connecting the at least one coil to an alternating current power source; and modulating the current from the power source to drive at least one of the magnetic sensor components into and out of saturation.","A more complete appreciation of the invention will be readily obtained by reference to the following Description of the Preferred Embodiments and the accompanying drawings in which like numerals in different figures represent the same structures or elements.

Generally, ME sensors are composed of layers of mechanically-coupled magnetoelectric and magnetostrictive material. In a magnetic field, the magnetostrictive material exerts a stress on the piezoelectric material, which in turn generates a charge.","As used in the following description of the preferred embodiments, the geometry of the layers in a ME sensor may be symmetric (e.g., Metglas-PZT-Metglas trilayer) or asymmetric (such as for example, Metglas-PZT bilayer) about a central plane parallel to the layers. Because their output depends on the amount of strain, larger ME sensors with centimeter dimensions tend to have greater sensitivity. These ME sensors also have increased sensitivity at their mechanical resonant modes, where the transfer of magnetostrictive strain to the piezoelectric laminate is enhanced. The longitudinal, resonant frequency of such symmetric ME sensors is of order 10 or more kHz. The bending, resonant mode of such unloaded asymmetric sensors in a cantilever configuration is often in the range of hundreds of Hz. ME sensors experience 1\/f noise that hampers their ability to detect fields at frequencies below several Hz. It is desirable to shift the operating frequency to a higher value where this noise is lower. There are instances, depending upon the noise, when the signal to noise ratio would be further improved if this shifted, higher operating frequency is equal to the resonant frequency where the ME sensors are more sensitive.","A preferred embodiment comprises a magnetoelectric sensor  comprising three magnetic materials as shown in . The layers may comprise magnetostrictive material such as Metglas\u00ae , a biasing ferromagnet , and a piezoelectric material . The amorphous alloy with the trade name Metglas 2605SC\u00ae has the composition FeSiBC. Favorable properties of this material are its high saturation magnetostriction constant, \u03bb, of about 20 ppm and more, coupled with a low magnetic anisotropy field strength, HA, of less than 1 kA\/m (to reach magnetic saturation). Metglas 2605SC\u00ae also exhibits a very strong magnetoelastic effect with reductions in the effective Young's modulus up to about 80% in bulk. The alloy(s) that exhibit the highest known magnetostriction is Terfenol-D, (Ter for terbium, Fe for iron, NOL for Naval Ordnance Laboratory, and D for dysprosium). Terfenol-D, TbDyFe, exhibits a uniaxial magnetostriction constant of about 2,000 ppm in a field of 2 kOe at room temperature and is believed to be the most commonly used engineering magnetostrictive material. The element that exhibits the largest room temperature magnetostriction of a pure element at 60 ppm is Cobalt. PZT, which is lead zirconate titanate (Pb[ZrTi]O0\u2266x\u22661), is a commonly used piezoelectric ceramic. Other ceramics with perovskite or tungsten-bronze structures that exhibit piezoelectricity are Barium titanate (BaTiO, lead titanate (PbTiO), Potassium niobate (KNbO), and Lithium niobate (LiNbO).","Magnetostrictive materials require a biasing field because their response to a magnetic field is essentially zero in with no magnetic field H=0. If the biasing magnet (layer)  is not present, a biasing field must be provided in some other way such as a more distant magnet or by coil. The magnetostrictive material surface (surface of layer ) and piezeoelectric material surface (surface of layer ) are mechanically constrained to move together at their interface. Thus, it can be appreciated that the stress of the magnetostrictive material in a magnetic field results in strain in the piezoelectric material that has the ability to transform mechanical energy from the magnetostrictive material into an electrical output; which generates an electric field; which comprises the output of the sensor.","The system has both inertia against movement and restoring forces that facilitate the return of the system to its undisturbed equilibrium position. When the system is driven to move at certain normal mode frequencies, the amplitude of the motion is large. A simple example of resonance occurs if one considers the motion of a mass m connected to a spring with spring constant k. The amplitude of the motion is greatest at the frequency f.",{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0043","num":"0042"},"maths":{"@attributes":{"id":"MATH-US-00001","num":"00001"},"math":{"@attributes":{"overflow":"scroll"},"mrow":{"mi":"f","mo":"=","mrow":{"mfrac":{"mn":"1","mrow":{"mn":"2","mo":"\u2062","mi":"\u03c0"}},"mo":"\u2062","msqrt":{"mfrac":{"mi":["k","m"]}}}}}},"br":{},"sub":"r"},"The magnetic materials comprise the magnetostrictive material, often Metglas\u00ae, flux concentrators  and , often permalloy, and possibly a ferromagnetic material such as Ni that provides a bias field for the magnetostrictive material.","The dimensions of the components in  may be as follows (where Dis the coil diameter, L, T, and Ware the length, thickness and width of the sensor:","Examples of Dimensions","D=range of roughly couple millimeters to several centimeters.","L=range of roughly couple millimeters to several centimeters.","T=on the order of a couple hundred microns.","W=(width of the sensor) on the order of a centimeter.",{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0046","num":"0000"},"ul":{"@attributes":{"id":"ul0001","list-style":"none"},"li":"Number of turns in coil on the order of 50-100; which depends upon the current which may range from 100 mA to approximately 3 Amps."}},"As shown in , the preferred embodiment comprises at least one coil  as shown in . When two coils are used, both coils have their field direction along the sense direction of the sensor. One coil  can be used to apply a dc field to bias the magnetostrictive material; which affords the opportunity to remove the bias layer from the sensor. The other coil provides an AC magnetic field at a frequency fthat is large enough in magnitude to drive one or several of the magnetic components of the sensor into and out of magnetic saturation.","The field supplied by the coil  does not interfere with the sensing operation because the frequencies are different. The frequencies in the coil  are roughly 100 Hertz or above. The frequencies of the field to be sensed are roughly 10 Hertz or below. The system will operate as describe herein if the sense frequency is less than the coil frequency. Though the coil  is described as operating to drive the materials in components (flux concentrator, magnetorestrictive material and biasing magnet) into and out of saturation, just driving any one of the flux concentrator, the magnetorestrictive material, or the biasing magnet beyond the linear range will create additional peaks. The sidebands represent the increased frequency of the signal due to the coil driving the materials into the nonlinear region or into and out of saturation.","When a component, e.g., the flux concentrator (,), the biasing magnet , and\/or the magnetostrictive material (Metglas\u00ae ), is saturated, the sensor will be much less sensitive. Thus, either the field sensed due to saturating the flux concentrator will be modulated at for the output amplitude of the sensor will be modulated at fif the biasing magnet or magnetostrictive material is driven into and out of saturation. This will shift the operating frequency to higher frequencies.","The preferred embodiment operates to shift the operating frequency to higher frequencies where 1\/f noise is smaller and\/or to a particular frequency to take advantage of the increased sensitivity of sensors at particular frequencies. Magnetoelectric sensors have increased sensitivity at their mechanical resonant frequency f. For example, when detecting a low frequency signal f, the coil is driven at fand sidebands appear at f\u00b1f. We can pick the modulation frequency fdriving the magnetic material into and out of saturation so that one of the sidebands is at the resonant frequency, i.e.,\n\nf=f\u2212for f=f+f\u2003\u2003(1)\n\nThis permits one to take advantage of the increased sensitivity of magnetoelectric sensors at the mechanical resonant frequency.\n","An increased signal to noise ratio has been demonstrated using this invention.  graphically shows the results. The sensor was an asymmetric magnetoelectric sensor with a Ni bias layer. As depicted in , the inputted signal was a 0.0162 Oe field at 1 Hz. The additional applied fields were applied by a coil  in . These fields were an additional DC bias field of 4.6 Oe and an AC field with an amplitude of 3.6 Oe. The detection of the direct 1 Hz signal is shown in . One sees that the signal to noise ratio is about 2.5 orders of magnitude. The input signal may be inputted into the preferred embodiment from the left as shown in .  shows two cases of field modulation. The first is the blue curve with the frequency scale at the bottom of the figure. The modulation frequency in this case is 84.3 Hz and the sidebands are not at the resonant frequency of the sensor. In this case, the signal to noise ratio is about 4 orders of magnitude.","Optimally, the modulation frequency is chosen so that one of the sidebands is at the mechanical resonant frequency of the sensor. The modulation frequency was chosen so that the frequency of the lower frequency sideband satisfied Eq. 1. The lower frequency sideband is increased in amplitude because it is at the resonant frequency. One can see in  that the lower frequency sideband is enhanced by more than a factor of 10 in comparison with the upper frequency sideband. Without demodulation the signal to noise ratio is 3 orders of magnitude. Thus, in both cases using the large field modulation increases the signal to noise ratio. If demodulation permitted the decrease in the background to that of the blue curve, the signal to noise ratio using the low frequency sideband will be 6 orders of magnitude.","The preferred embodiment of  comprises an intermediate piezoelectric layer  sandwiched between two magnetostrictive layers (such as for example, Metglas\u00ae layers)  to form a symmetrical assembly. From  it can be seen that the biasing ferromagnetic layer  is not connected to the layer . The embodiment of  is a composite laminate, formed of one piezo-fiber layer  arranged between two high-permeability magnetostrictive alloy layers , such as FeBSiC. The fiber layers  may, for example, be PZT-5A ceramic fibers, PMN-PT or PZN-PT single crystal fibers, or equivalent. An illustrative example fiber thickness may, for example, be approximately 350 \u03bcm and the Metglas\u00ae layers may have, for example, a thickness of 25 \u03bcm. One example arrangement is one piezoelectric PZT fiber layer between two high permeability magnetostrictive layers. A plurality of alternating symmetric units connecting to at least one of the piezoelectric fiber layers may be used with the number of magnetostrictive layers exceeding the piezo-fiber layers by one.",{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0054","num":"0053"},"figref":["FIG. 5","FIG. 3","FIG. 10"],"b":["10","10","21","21","23","24","23","30","30","34","24","23","30"]},"The present invention provides a method for increasing the operating frequency of centimeter sized magnetic sensors to decrease the problem of 1\/f noise and\/or for taking advantage of a specific frequency where the sensor has improved performance.

In the case of magnetoelectric (ME) sensors, these components are the flux concentrator, possibly the biasing magnet used to bias the magnetostrictive material, and the magnetostrictive material.

Electrical leads were silver-epoxied to the PZT, which was poled perpendicular to the length of the laminate. It was fixed at one end in a cantilever configuration. The Ni provided a field to bias the ME sensor.","The measuring system consisted of a set of Helmholtz coils, powered by an Agilent 33220A signal generator that was used to apply a sinusoidal, time varying field Halong the longitudinal axis of the sensor. In these experiments, no flux concentrators were employed, although the system may optionally include flux concentrators. The signal was detected first using a charge coupled amplifier, PCB Piezotronics Model 441A101, and then filtered in a SR640 low-pass filter with no gain before being sent either to a spectrum analyzer that uses a LabVIEW VI program or to a SR830 DSP Lock-In Amplifier. Resonance frequencies for each cantilever setup were obtained by sweeping the frequency of a 0.0162 Oe external field at progressively finer intervals around the peak value. All the measurements were conducted in our laboratory without the benefit of magnetic, electric, and thermal shielding. Acoustic isolation was provided by a Hertz DT-M vibration isolator.","The ME response after applying a signal field Hof 0.0162 Oe at 140 Hz and a DC field from the surrounding coil as a function of a DC bias field is shown in  for, respectively, the asymmetric and symmetric sensors. Both responses are strongly dependent on the DC field and are approximately symmetric functions of this bias. The asymmetric sensor was designed to have a local maximum sensitivity at zero DC field due to the residual magnetism of the Ni adjacent to the Metglas. The magnetic properties of this Ni layer makes the ME response to an additional applied field more complicated. To modulate the sensor optimally, the magnitude of the AC modulation field Hwas chosen so that the ME output of the sensor at a fixed field oscillated between its minimum value and a much larger value.",{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0062","num":"0061"},"figref":["FIG. 8","FIG. 9"],"sub":["m ","m ","s ","m ","m","s","m","s ","m ","m ","m","m","m","m "],"sup":["2","2 "]},{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0063","num":"0062"},"figref":["FIG. 10","FIG. 11"],"sub":"s"},"The invention may be utilized at a security check point to detect unapproved transport of banned items, as part of a sensor in an unattended ground sensor network, to control manufacturing processes, to check the proper functioning of the hearts of babies before birth, and with drugs containing nanomagnets for monitoring of the dissemination of drugs in the body of patients using sensors.","The advantages of the present invention are that one can operate the sensor at a frequency where its sensitivity is higher and the 1\/f noise is lower. Results have been obtained using 5 cm long asymmetric magnetoelectric sensors.","As used herein the terminology \u201csaturation\u201d means the state reached when an increase in applied external magnetizing field H cannot increase the magnetization of the material further, so the total magnetic field B levels off. In the context of the magnetization curve of a substance, it is manifested as a bending to the right of the curve. As the H field increases, the B field approaches a maximum value asymptotically; i.e., the saturation level for the substance. Above saturation, the B field continues increasing, but at the paramagnetic rate, which is 3 orders of magnitude smaller than the ferromagnetic rate seen below saturation. The relation between the magnetizing field H and the magnetic field B is the magnetic permeability: \u03bc=B\/H. In saturable materials the permeability increases with H to a maximum, then as it approaches saturation inverts and decreases toward zero.","Although various preferred embodiments of the present invention have been described herein in detail to provide for complete and clear disclosure, it will be appreciated by those skilled in the art, that variations may be made thereto without departing from the spirit of the invention.","It should be emphasized that the above-described embodiments are merely possible examples of implementations.
