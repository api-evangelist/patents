No. 12\/812,384, which is a 35 U.S.C. 371 national stage application of International Patent Application No. PCT\/US2009\/030603, filed Jan. 9, 2009, and claims priority to U.S. Provisional Application No. 61\/020,125 that was filed on Jan. 9, 2008, which are incorporated herein by reference in their entirety.","1. Field of the Invention","This invention relates to novel inhibitors of serine\/threonine protein kinases (e.g., Akt and related kinases), pharmaceutical compositions containing the inhibitors, methods for preparing these inhibitors and their use as therapeutics. The inhibitors are useful, for example, for the treatment of hyperproliferative diseases, such as cancer and inflammation, in mammals.","2. Description of the State of the Art","Protein kinases (PK) are enzymes that catalyze the phosphorylation of hydroxy groups on tyrosine, serine and threonine residues of proteins by transfer of the terminal (gamma) phosphate from ATP. Through signal transduction pathways, these enzymes modulate cell growth, differentiation and proliferation, i.e., virtually all aspects of cell life in one way or another depend on PK activity (Hardie, G. and Hanks, S. (1995) , Academic Press, San Diego, Calif.). Furthermore, abnormal PK activity has been related to a host of disorders, ranging from relatively non-life threatening diseases such as psoriasis to extremely virulent diseases such as glioblastoma (brain cancer). Protein kinases are an important target class for therapeutic modulation (Cohen, P. (2002) Nature Rev. Drug Discovery 1:309).","Protein kinases include two classes; protein tyrosine kinases (PTK) and serine-threonine kinases (STK). The Protein Kinase B\/Akt enzymes are a group of serine\/threonine kinases that are overexpressed in a variety of human tumors. One of the best-characterized targets of the PI3K lipid products is the 57 KD serine\/threonine protein kinase Akt, downstream of PI3K in the signal transduction pathway (Hemmings, B. A. (1997) Science 275:628; Hay N. (2005) Cancer Cell 8:179-183). Akt is the human homologue of the protooncogene v-akt of the acutely transforming retrovirus Akt8. Due to its high sequence homology to protein kinases A and C, Akt is also called Protein Kinase B (PKB) and Related to A and C (RAC). Three isoforms of Akt are known to exist, namely Akt1, Akt2 and Akt3, which exhibit an overall homology of 80% (Staal, S. P. (1987) Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. 84:5034; Nakatani, K. (1999) Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 257:906; Li et al (2002) Current Topics in Med. Chem. 2:939-971; WO 2005\/113762). The Akt isoforms share a common domain organization that consists of a pleckstrin homology domain at the N-terminus, a kinase catalytic domain, and a short regulatory region at the C-terminus. In addition, both Akt2 and Akt3 exhibit splice variants. Upon recruitment to the cell membrane by PtdInd(3,4,5)P, Akt is phosphorylated (activated) by PDK1 at T308, T309 and T305 for isoforms Akt1 (PKB\u03b1), Akt2 (PKB\u03b2) and Akt3 (PKB\u03b3), respectively, and at S473, 5474 and S472 for isoforms Akt1, Akt2 and Akt3, respectively. Such phosphorylation occurs by an as yet unknown kinase (putatively named PDK2), although PDK1 (Balendran, A., (1999) Curr. Biol. 9:393), autophosphorylation (Toker, A. (2000) J. Biol. Chem. 275:8271) and integrin-linked kinase (ILK) (Delcommenne, M. (1998) Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. USA, 95:11211) have been implicated in this process. Akt activation requires its phosphorylation on residue Ser 473 in the C-terminal hydrophobic motif (Brodbeck et al (1999) J. Biol. Chem. 274:9133-9136; Coffer et al (1991) Eur. J. Biochem. 201:475-481; Alessi et al (1997) Curr. Biol. 7:261-269). Although monophosphorylation of Akt activates the kinase, bis(phosphorylation) is required for maximal kinase activity.","Akt is believed to assert its effect on cancer by suppressing apoptosis and enhancing both angiogenesis and proliferation (Toker et al. (2006) Cancer Res. 66(8):3963-3966). Akt is overexpressed in many forms of human cancer including, but not limited to, colon (Zinda et al (2001) Clin. Cancer Res. 7:2475), ovarian (Cheng et al (1992) Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. USA 89:9267), brain (Haas Kogan et al (1998) Curr. Biol. 8:1195), lung (Brognard et al (2001) Cancer Res. 61:3986), pancreatic (Bellacosa et al (1995) Int. J. Cancer 64:280-285; Cheng et al (1996) Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. 93:3636-3641), prostate (Graff et al (2000) J. Biol. Chem. 275:24500) and gastric carcinomas (Staal et al (1987) Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. USA 84:5034-5037).","The development of kinase inhibitors that target abnormally regulated pathways and ultimately result in disease is of enormous ethical and commercial interest to the medical and pharmaceutical community. A compound that inhibits (1) recruitment of Akt to the cell membrane, (2) activation by PDK1 or PDK2, (3) substrate phosphorylation, or (4) one of the downstream targets of Akt could be a valuable anticancer agent, either as a stand-alone therapy or in conjunction with other accepted procedures.","Inhibitors of Akt are known, see for example, United States Patent Application Publication 2005\/0130954, United States Patent Application Publication 2008\/0058327, United States Patent Application Publication 2008\/0051399, and International Patent Application Publication WO 2006\/090261.","The present invention includes novel compounds and compositions that inhibit protein kinases.

For example, at least 100-fold, and as a further example, at least 150-fold more selective for Akt versus PKA. Selectivity over PKA is desirable, since PKA is involved in many cellular processes important for the normal function and physiology of many cell types.

such compounds can therefore be produced as individual (R)- or (S)-stereoisomers or as mixtures thereof. Unless indicated otherwise, the description or naming of a particular compound in the specification and claims is intended to include both individual enantiomers and diastereomers, and mixtures, racemic or otherwise, thereof. Accordingly, this invention also includes all such isomers, including diastereomeric mixtures, pure diastereomers and pure enantiomers of the compounds of this invention. The term \u201cenantiomer\u201d refers to two stereoisomers of a compound which are non-superimposable mirror images of one another. The term \u201cdiastereomer\u201d refers to a pair of optical isomers which are not mirror images of one another. Diastereomers have different physical properties, e.g. melting points, boiling points, spectral properties, and reactivities.","The compounds of the present invention can also exist in different tautomeric forms, and all such forms are embraced within the scope of the invention. The term \u201ctautomer\u201d or \u201ctautomeric form\u201d refers to structural isomers of different energies which are interconvertible via a low energy barrier. For example, proton tautomers (also known as prototropic tautomers) include interconversions via migration of a proton, such as keto-enol and imine-enamine isomerizations. Valence tautomers include interconversions by reorganization of some of the bonding electrons.","In the structures shown herein, where the stereochemistry of any particular chiral atom is not specified, then all stereoisomers are contemplated and included as the compounds of the invention. Where stereochemistry is specified by a solid wedge or dashed line representing a particular configuration, then that stereoisomer is so specified and defined.","The compounds of Formula I include solvates, pharmaceutically acceptable prodrugs and salts (including pharmaceutically acceptable salts) of such compounds.","The phrase \u201cpharmaceutically acceptable\u201d indicates that the substance or composition is compatible chemically and\/or toxicologically with the other ingredients comprising a formulation, and\/or the mammal being treated therewith.","A \u201csolvate\u201d refers to an association or complex of one or more solvent molecules and a compound of the invention. Examples of solvents that form solvates include, but are not limited to, water, isopropanol, ethanol, methanol, DMSO, ethyl acetate, acetic acid, and ethanolamine.

For instance, a free carboxyl group of a compound of Formula I can be derivatized as an amide or alkyl ester. As another example, compounds of this invention comprising free hydroxy groups can be derivatized as prodrugs by converting the hydroxy group into a group such as, but not limited to, a phosphate ester, hemisuccinate, dimethylaminoacetate, or phosphoryloxymethyloxycarbonyl group, as outlined in 1996, 19, 115. Carbamate prodrugs of hydroxy and amino groups are also included, as are carbonate prodrugs, sulfonate esters and sulfate esters of hydroxy groups. Derivatization of hydroxy groups as (acyloxy)methyl and (acyloxy)ethyl ethers, wherein the acyl group can be an alkyl ester optionally substituted with groups including, but not limited to, ether, amine and carboxylic acid functionalities, or where the acyl group is an amino acid ester as described above, are also encompassed.

Examples of organic base salts for use include, for example, ammonium, dibenzylammonium, benzylammonium, 2-hydroxyethylammonium, bis(2-hydroxyethyl)ammonium, phenylethylbenzylamine, dibenzylethylenediamine, and the like salts. Other salts of acidic moieties can include, for example, those salts formed with procaine, quinine and N-methylglucosamine, plus salts formed with basic amino acids such as glycine, ornithine, histidine, phenylglycine, lysine and arginine.","In certain embodiments, the salt is a \u201cpharmaceutically acceptable salt\u201d which, unless otherwise indicated, includes salts that retain the biological effectiveness of the corresponding free acid or base of the specified compound and are not biologically or otherwise undesirable.","The compounds of Formula I also include other salts of such compounds which are not necessarily pharmaceutically acceptable salts, and which can be useful as intermediates for preparing and\/or purifying compounds of Formula I and\/or for separating enantiomers of compounds of Formula I.","The present invention also embraces isotopically-labeled compounds of the present invention which are identical to those recited herein, but for the fact that one or more atoms are replaced by an atom having an atomic mass or mass number different from the atomic mass or mass number usually found in nature. All isotopes of any particular atom or element as specified are contemplated within the scope of the compounds of the invention, and their uses. Exemplary isotopes that can be incorporated into compounds of the invention include isotopes of hydrogen, carbon, nitrogen, oxygen, phosphorus, sulfur, fluorine, chlorine and iodine, such as H, H, C, C, C, N, N, O, O, O, P, P, S, F, Cl, , and I. Certain isotopically-labeled compounds of the present invention (e.g., those labeled with H and C) are useful in compound and\/or substrate tissue distribution assays. Tritiated (i.e., H) and carbon-14 (i.e., C) isotopes are useful for their ease of preparation and detectability. Further, substitution with heavier isotopes such as deuterium (i.e., H) can afford certain therapeutic advantages resulting from greater metabolic stability (e.g., increased in vivo half-life or reduced dosage requirements). Positron emitting isotopes such as O, N, C and F are useful for positron emission tomography (PET) studies to examine substrate receptor occupancy. Isotopically labeled compounds of the present invention can generally be prepared by following procedures analogous to those disclosed in the Schemes and\/or in the Examples herein below, by substituting an isotopically labeled reagent for a non-isotopically labeled reagent.","Metabolites of Compounds of Formula I","Also falling within the scope of this invention are the in vivo metabolic products of compounds of Formula I described herein.

Accordingly, the invention includes metabolites of compounds of Formula I, including compounds produced by a process comprising contacting a compound of this invention with a mammal for a period of time sufficient to yield a metabolic product thereof.","Metabolites are identified, for example, by preparing a radiolabelled (e.g., C or H) isotope of a compound of the invention, administering it parenterally in a detectable dose (e.g., greater than about 0.5 mg\/kg) to an animal such as rat, mouse, guinea pig, monkey, or to a human, allowing sufficient time for metabolism to occur (typically about 30 seconds to 30 hours) and isolating its conversion products from the urine, blood or other biological samples. These products are easily isolated since they are labeled (others are isolated by the use of antibodies capable of binding epitopes surviving in the metabolite). The metabolite structures are determined in conventional fashion, e.g., by MS, LC\/MS or NMR analysis. In general, analysis of metabolites is done in the same way as conventional drug metabolism studies well known to those skilled in the art. The metabolites, so long as they are not otherwise found in vivo, are useful in diagnostic assays for therapeutic dosing of the compounds of the invention.","Synthesis of Compounds of Formula I","Compounds of this invention can be synthesized by synthetic routes that include processes analogous to those well known in the chemical arts, particularly in light of the description contained herein.

According to Scheme 1, intermediate 3 can be prepared by brominating (+)-pulegone 1 to provide the di-bromide 2, followed by treatment of the di-bromide 2 with a base such as sodium ethoxide. Oxidative cleavage (for example, ozonolysis at about \u221280\u00b0 C. to \u221250\u00b0 C.) of the pulegenate 3 gives the ketoester 4. The pyrimidine ring 6 is constructed by reaction of the ketoester 4 with thiourea in the presence of base such as KOH. The mercapto group at 2-position of compound 6 is eliminated by reduction (for example, Raney Ni in ammonia) to give compound 7. Alternatively, the ketoester 4 can be converted to the same hydroxypyrimidine 7 by treatment with (for example) an ammonia synthon such as NHOAc, followed by pyrimidine formation using, for example, ammonium formate in the presence of formamide at 50\u00b0 C. to 250\u00b0 C. and\/or at high pressure and\/or microwave assistance. Activation of the hydroxypyrimidine 7 (for example, POCl) provides the 4-chloropyrimidine 8. Compounds of formula 10 can be synthesized by coupling of the chloropyrimidine 8 with optionally substituted spiroindolines of formula 9 where Pg is an amine protecting group (for example, Boc, Cbz or benzyl group) via metal-mediated reactions, typically using a Pd catalyst such as Pd(OAc), a phosphine ligand, such as Xantphos (9,9-dimethyl-4,5-bis(diphenylphosphino)xanthene available from Strem Chemicals, Inc., Newburyport, Mass.), a base such as CsCO, in an organic solvent such as toluene or THF at a temperature of between about 25\u00b0 C. to 120\u00b0 C. The amine protecting group in 10 can be removed using conventional procedures to produce the free amine. The addition and removal of numerous protecting groups is discussed by T. W. Greene and G. M. Wults in , Second Edition, Wiley, New York, 1991. For example, Boc protecting group can be removed by treating with a strong acid such as trifluoroacetic acid (TFA) or hydrochloric acid in the presence of an inert solvent such as dichloromethane or methanol. Removal of Cbz group can be carried out by catalytic hydrogenation with hydrogen in the presence of a palladium catalyst or by transfer hydrogenation. Benzyl group can be removed by catalytic hydrogenation, transfer hydrogenation or by treatment with 1-chloroethyl chloroformate. After deprotection, the unprotected amines can be optionally functionalized (for example, alkylation or reductive amination to introduce new substituents) to give rise to the final compound 11.

The desired products of each step or series of steps is separated and\/or purified to the desired degree of homogeneity by the techniques common in the art. Typically such separations involve multiphase extraction, crystallization from a solvent or solvent mixture, distillation, sublimation, or chromatography. Chromatography can involve any number of methods including, for example: reverse-phase and normal phase; size exclusion; ion exchange; high, medium and low pressure liquid chromatography methods and apparatus; small scale analytical; simulated moving bed (SMB) and preparative thin or thick layer chromatography, as well as techniques of small scale thin layer and flash chromatography.","Another class of separation methods involves treatment of a reaction mixture with a reagent selected to bind to or render otherwise separable a desired product, unreacted starting material, reaction by product, or the like. Such reagents include adsorbents or absorbents such as activated carbon, molecular sieves, ion exchange media, or the like. Alternatively, the reagents can be acids in the case of a basic material, bases in the case of an acidic material, binding reagents such as antibodies, binding proteins, selective chelators such as crown ethers, liquid\/liquid ion extraction reagents (LIX), or the like.","Selection of the method for separation depends on the nature of the materials involved. For example, boiling point and molecular weight in distillation and sublimation, presence or absence of polar functional groups in chromatography, stability of materials in acidic and basic media in multiphase extraction, and the like.","Diastereomeric mixtures can be separated into their individual diastereomers on the basis of their physical chemical differences by methods well known to those skilled in the art, such as by chromatography and\/or fractional crystallization. Enantiomers can be separated by converting the enantiomeric mixture into a diastereomeric mixture by reaction with an optically active compound (for example, a chiral auxiliary such as a chiral alcohol or Mosher's acid chloride), separating the diastereomers and converting (e.g., hydrolyzing) the individual diastereoisomers to the corresponding pure enantiomers. Enantiomers can be separated by use of a chiral HPLC column, as known to one of ordinary skill in the art. Crystallization is another exemplary method for separating enantiomers. In another embodiment, compounds of Formula I can include atropisomers (e.g., substituted biaryls), which can be separated using, for example, chromatographic methods of separation.","A single stereoisomer, e.g., an enantiomer, substantially free of its stereoisomer can be obtained by resolution of the racemic mixture using a method such as formation of diastereomers using optically active resolving agents (Eliel, E. and Wilen, S. \u201cStereochemistry of Organic Compounds,\u201d John Wiley & Sons, Inc., New York, 1994; Lochmuller, C. H., ., (1975) 113(3):283-302). Racemic mixtures of chiral compounds of the invention can be separated and isolated by any method known to one skilled in the art, including: (1) formation of ionic, diastereomeric salts with chiral compounds and separation by fractional crystallization or other methods, (2) formation of diastereomeric compounds with chiral derivatizing reagents, separation of the diastereomers, and conversion to the pure stereoisomers, and (3) separation of the substantially pure or enriched stereoisomers directly under chiral conditions. See: \u201cDrug Stereochemistry, Analytical Methods and Pharmacology,\u201d Irving W. Wainer, Ed., Marcel Dekker, Inc., New York (1993).","Under method (1), diastereomeric salts can be formed by reaction of enantiomerically pure chiral bases such as brucine, quinine, ephedrine, strychnine, \u03b1-methyl-\u03b2-phenylethylamine (amphetamine), and the like with asymmetric compounds bearing acidic functionality, such as carboxylic acid and sulfonic acid. The diastereomeric salts can be induced to separate by fractional crystallization or ionic chromatography. For separation of the optical isomers of amino compounds, addition of chiral carboxylic or sulfonic acids, such as camphorsulfonic acid, tartaric acid, mandelic acid, or lactic acid can result in formation of the diastereomeric salts.","Alternatively, by method (2), the substrate to be resolved is reacted with one enantiomer of a chiral compound to form a diastereomeric pair (E. and Wilen, S. \u201cStereochemistry of Organic Compounds\u201d, John Wiley & Sons, Inc., 1994, p. 322). Diastereomeric compounds can be formed by reacting asymmetric compounds with enantiomerically pure chiral derivatizing reagents, such as menthyl derivatives, followed by separation of the diastereomers and hydrolysis to yield the pure or enriched enantiomer. A method of determining optical purity involves making chiral esters, such as a menthyl ester, e.g., (\u2212)menthyl chloroformate in the presence of base, or Mosher ester, \u03b1-methoxy-\u03b1-(trifluoromethyl)phenyl acetate (Jacob III. ., (1982) 47:4165), of the racemic mixture, and analyzing the H NMR spectrum for the presence of the two atropisomeric enantiomers or diastereomers. Stable diastereomers of atropisomeric compounds can be separated and isolated by normal- and reverse-phase chromatography following methods for separation of atropisomeric naphthyl-isoquinolines (WO 96\/15111). By method (3), a racemic mixture of two enantiomers can be separated by chromatography using a chiral stationary phase (\u201cChiral Liquid Chromatography\u201d (1989) W. J. Lough, Ed., Chapman and Hall, New York; Okamoto, ., (1990) 513:375-378). Enriched or purified enantiomers can be distinguished by methods used to distinguish other chiral molecules with asymmetric carbon atoms, such as optical rotation and circular dichroism.","Methods of Treatment with Compounds of Formula I","In another embodiment, the present invention relates to a method of treating or lessening the severity of a disease or condition susceptible to the inhibition of an Akt protein kinase activity in a patient, comprising administering to said patient a therapeutically effective amount of a compound of Formula I.","In one embodiment, the Akt kinase is Akt-1, Akt-2 or Akt-3 kinase.","In one embodiment, the Akt kinase is any combination of all three Akt-1, Akt-2 and Akt-3 kinase.","In another embodiment, the Akt kinase is any combination of Akt-1 and one of Akt-2 and Akt-3 kinase.

In the case of cancer, an effective amount of the drug can reduce the number of cancer cells; reduce the tumor size; inhibit (i.e., slow to some extent and in some cases stop) cancer cell infiltration into peripheral organs; inhibit (i.e., slow to some extent and in some cases stop) tumor metastasis; inhibit, to some extent, tumor growth; and\/or relieve to some extent one or more of the symptoms associated with the cancer. To the extent the drug can prevent growth and\/or kill existing cancer cells, it can be cytostatic and\/or cytotoxic. For cancer therapy, efficacy can be measured, for example, by assessing the time to disease progression (TTP) and\/or determining the response rate (RR).","The amount of a compound of Formula I that will correspond to such an amount will vary depending upon factors such as the particular compound, disease condition and its severity, the identity (e.g., weight) of the mammal in need of treatment, but can nevertheless be routinely determined by one skilled in the art.","\u201cTreating\u201d is intended to mean at least the mitigation of a disease condition in a mammal, such as a human, that is affected, at least in part, by the activity of one or more Akt protein kinases, tyrosine kinases, additional serine\/threonine kinases, and\/or dual specificity kinases. The terms \u201ctreat\u201d and \u201ctreatment\u201d refer to both therapeutic treatment and prophylactic or preventative measures, wherein the object is to prevent or slow down (lessen) an undesired physiological change or disorder. For purposes of this invention, beneficial or desired clinical results include, but are not limited to, alleviation of symptoms, diminishment of extent of disease, stabilized (i.e., not worsening) state of disease, delay or slowing of disease progression, amelioration or palliation of the disease state, and remission (whether partial or total), whether detectable or undetectable. \u201cTreatment\u201d can also mean prolonging survival as compared to expected survival if not receiving treatment. Those in need of treatment include those already with the condition or disorder as well as those found to be predisposed to having the disease condition but have not yet been diagnosed as having it; modulating and\/or inhibiting the disease condition. The terms \u201ctreating\u201d, \u201ctreat\u201d, or \u201ctreatment\u201d embrace both preventative, i.e., prophylactic, and palliative treatment.","As used herein, the term \u201cpatient\u201d includes all mammals. The term \u201cmammal\u201d refers to a warm-blooded animal that has or is at risk of developing a disease described herein and includes, but is not limited to, guinea pigs, dogs, cats, rats, mice, hamsters, and primates, including humans.","This invention also provides compounds of Formula I for use in the treatment of Akt protein kinase-mediated conditions.","An additional aspect of the invention is the use of a compound of Formula I in the preparation of a medicament for therapy, such as for the treatment or prevention of Akt protein kinase-mediated conditions.","Combination Therapy","The compounds of the present invention can be used in combination with one or more additional drugs such as described below. The dose of the second drug can be selected based on a clinically employed dose. The proportion of the compound of the present invention and the second drug can be determined according to the administration subject, the administration route, the target disease, the clinical condition, the combination, and other factors. In cases where the administration subject is a human, for instance, the second drug can be used in an amount of 0.01 to 100 parts by weight per part by weight of the compound of the present invention.","In one embodiment, the second compound of the pharmaceutical combination formulation or dosing regimen has complementary activities in relation to the compound of Formula I, such that they do not adversely affect each other. Such drugs can be present in combination in amounts that are effective for the purpose intended. Accordingly, another aspect of the present invention provides a composition comprising a compound of Formula I in combination with a second drug described herein.","A compound of Formula I and the additional pharmaceutically active drug(s) can be administered together in a unitary pharmaceutical composition or separately and, when administered separately this can occur simultaneously or sequentially in any order. Such sequential administration can be close in time or remote in time. The amounts of the compound of this invention and the second drug(s) and the relative timings of administration will be selected in order to achieve the desired combined therapeutic effect.","The combination therapy can provide \u201csynergy\u201d and prove \u201csynergistic\u201d, i.e., the effect achieved when the active ingredients used together is greater than the sum of the effects that results from using the compounds separately. A synergistic effect can be attained when the active ingredients are: (1) co-formulated and administered or delivered simultaneously in a combined, unit dosage formulation; (2) delivered by alternation or in parallel as separate formulations; or (3) by some other regimen. When delivered in alternation therapy, a synergistic effect can be attained when the compounds are administered or delivered sequentially, e.g., by different injections in separate syringes. In general, during alternation therapy, an effective dosage of each active ingredient is administered sequentially, i.e., serially, whereas in combination therapy, effective dosages of two or more active ingredients are administered together.","A \u201cchemotherapeutic agent\u201d is a chemical compound useful in the treatment of cancer, regardless of mechanism of action.

According to this aspect of the invention there is provided a pharmaceutical composition that comprises a compound of this invention. In certain embodiments, the pharmaceutical composition comprises a compound of Formula I in association with a pharmaceutically acceptable carrier, adjuvant, vehicle or diluent.","The pharmaceutical compositions of the invention are formulated, dosed and administered in a fashion, i.e., amounts, concentrations, schedules, course, vehicles and route of administration, consistent with good medical practice. Factors for consideration in this context include the particular disorder being treated, the particular mammal being treated, the clinical condition of the individual patient, the cause of the disorder, the site of delivery of the agent, the method of administration, the scheduling of administration, and other factors known to medical practitioners. The therapeutically effective amount of the compound to be administered will be governed by such considerations, and is the minimum amount necessary to prevent, ameliorate, or treat the disorder. The compound of the present invention is typically formulated into pharmaceutical dosage forms to provide an easily controllable dosage of the drug and to enable patient compliance with the prescribed regimen.","In certain embodiments, the composition for use herein is sterile. In particular, formulations to be used for in vivo administration must be sterile. Such sterilization is readily accomplished, for example, by filtration through sterile filtration membranes. The compound ordinarily can be stored as a solid composition, a lyophilized formulation or as an aqueous solution.","Pharmaceutical formulations of the compounds of the present invention can be prepared for various routes and types of administration. For example, a compound of this invention having the desired degree of purity can optionally be mixed with pharmaceutically acceptable diluents, carriers, excipients or stabilizers (Remington The Science and Practice of Pharmacy (2005) 21st edition, Hendrickson, R. Ed.), in the form of a lyophilized formulation, a milled powder, or an aqueous solution. Formulations can be conducted by mixing at ambient temperature and a given pH, and at the desired degree of purity, with physiologically acceptable carriers (for example, carriers that are non-toxic to recipients at the dosages and concentrations employed). The pH of the formulation depends mainly on the particular use and the concentration of compound, but can range from about 3 to about 8. Formulation in an acetate buffer at about pH 5 is one exemplary embodiment. The formulations can be prepared using conventional dissolution and mixing procedures. For example, the bulk drug substance (i.e., compound of the present invention or stabilized form of the compound (e.g., complex with a cyclodextrin derivative or other known complexation agent) is dissolved in a solvent, for example, water or ethanol, in the presence of one or more excipients.","The particular carrier, diluent or excipient used will depend upon the means and purpose for which the compound of the present invention is being applied. Solvents are generally selected based on solvents recognized by persons skilled in the art as safe (GRAS) to be administered to a mammal. In general, safe solvents are non-toxic aqueous solvents such as water and other non-toxic solvents that are soluble or miscible in water. Exemplary aqueous solvents include, but are not limited to water, ethanol, propylene glycol, polyethylene glycols (e.g., PEG 400, PEG 300), etc. and mixtures thereof. Acceptable diluents, carriers, excipients and stabilizers are nontoxic to recipients at the dosages and concentrations employed, and include buffers such as phosphate, citrate and other organic acids; antioxidants including ascorbic acid and methionine; preservatives (such as octadecyldimethylbenzyl ammonium chloride; hexamethonium chloride; benzalkonium chloride, benzethonium chloride; phenol, butyl or benzyl alcohol; alkyl parabens such as methyl or propyl paraben; catechol; resorcinol; cyclohexanol; 3-pentanol; and m-cresol); low molecular weight (less than about 10 residues) polypeptides; proteins, such as serum albumin, gelatin, or immunoglobulins; hydrophilic polymers such as polyvinylpyrrolidone; amino acids such as glycine, glutamine, asparagine, histidine, arginine, or lysine; monosaccharides, disaccharides and other carbohydrates including glucose, mannose, or dextrins; chelating agents such as EDTA; sugars such as sucrose, mannitol, trehalose or sorbitol; salt-forming counter-ions such as sodium; metal complexes (e.g., Zn-protein complexes); and\/or non-ionic surfactants such as TWEEN\u2122, PLURONICS\u2122 or polyethylene glycol (PEG). The formulations can also include one or more stabilizing agents, surfactants, wetting agents, lubricating agents, emulsifiers, suspending agents, preservatives, antioxidants, opaquing agents, glidants, processing aids, colorants, sweeteners, perfuming agents, flavoring agents and other known additives to provide an elegant presentation of the drug (i.e., a compound of the present invention or pharmaceutical composition thereof) or aid in the manufacturing of the pharmaceutical product (i.e., medicament). The active pharmaceutical ingredients can also be entrapped in microcapsules prepared, for example, by coacervation techniques or by interfacial polymerization, for example, hydroxymethylcellulose or gelatin-microcapsules and poly-(methylmethacrylate) microcapsules, respectively, in colloidal drug delivery systems (for example, liposomes, albumin microspheres, microemulsions, nanoparticles and nanocapsules) or in macroemulsions. Such techniques are disclosed in Remington's Pharmaceutical Sciences 16th edition, Osol, A. Ed. (1980). A \u201cliposome\u201d is a small vesicle composed of various types of lipids, phospholipids and\/or surfactant which is useful for delivery of a drug (such as a compound of Formula I and, optionally, an additional therapeutic agent) to a mammal. The components of the liposome are commonly arranged in a bilayer formation, similar to the lipid arrangement of biological membranes.","Sustained-release preparations of compounds of this invention can be prepared. Examples of sustained-release preparations include semipermeable matrices of solid hydrophobic polymers containing a compound of Formula I, which matrices are in the form of shaped articles, e.g., films, or microcapsules.

No. 3,773,919), copolymers of L-glutamic acid and gamma-ethyl-L-glutamate, non-degradable ethylene-vinyl acetate, degradable lactic acid-glycolic acid copolymers such as the LUPRON DEPOT\u2122 (injectable microspheres composed of lactic acid-glycolic acid copolymer and leuprolide acetate) and poly-D-(\u2212)-3-hydroxybutyric acid.","Pharmaceutical compositions comprising compounds of Formula I can be in the form of a sterile injectable preparation, such as a sterile injectable aqueous or oleaginous suspension. This suspension can be formulated according to the known art using dispersing or wetting agents and suspending agents which have been mentioned above. The sterile injectable preparation can also be a sterile injectable solution or suspension in a non-toxic parenterally acceptable diluent or solvent, such as a solution in 1,3-butanediol or prepared as a lyophilized powder. Among the acceptable vehicles and solvents that can be employed are water, Ringer's solution and isotonic sodium chloride solution. In addition, sterile fixed oils can conventionally be employed as a solvent or suspending medium. For this purpose any bland fixed oil can be employed including synthetic mono- or diglycerides. In addition, fatty acids such as oleic acid can likewise be used in the preparation of injectables.","Exemplary formulations for parenteral administration include aqueous and non-aqueous sterile injection solutions which can contain anti-oxidants, buffers, bacteriostats and solutes which render the formulation isotonic with the blood of the intended recipient; and aqueous and non-aqueous sterile suspensions which can include suspending agents and thickening agents.","In another embodiment, compositions comprising a compound of Formula I can also be in a form for oral use (for example as tablets, lozenges, hard or soft capsules, aqueous or oily suspensions, emulsions, dispersible powders or granules, syrups or elixirs), for topical use (for example as creams, ointments, gels, or aqueous or oily solutions or suspensions), for administration by inhalation (for example as a finely divided powder or a liquid aerosol), for administration by insufflation (for example as a finely divided powder).","Exemplary pharmaceutically-acceptable excipients for a tablet formulation include, but are not limited to, inert diluents such as lactose, sodium carbonate, calcium phosphate or calcium carbonate, granulating and disintegrating agents such as corn starch or algenic acid; binding agents such as starch; lubricating agents such as magnesium stearate, stearic acid or talc; preservative agents such as ethyl or propyl p-hydroxybenzoate, and anti-oxidants, such as ascorbic acid. Tablet formulations can be uncoated or coated either to modify their disintegration and the subsequent absorption of the active ingredient within the gastrointestinal tract, or to improve their stability and\/or appearance, in either case, using conventional coating agents and procedures known in the art.","Compositions for oral use can be in the form of hard gelatin capsules in which the active ingredient is mixed with an inert solid diluent, for example, calcium carbonate, calcium phosphate or kaolin, or as soft gelatin capsules in which the active ingredient is mixed with water or an oil such as peanut oil, liquid paraffin, or olive oil.","Aqueous suspensions generally contain the active ingredient in finely powdered form together with one or more suspending agents, such as sodium carboxymethylcellulose, methylcellulose, hydroxypropylmethylcellulose, sodium alginate, polyvinyl-pyrrolidone, gum tragacanth and gum acacia; dispersing or wetting agents such as lecithin or condensation products of an alkylene oxide with fatty acids (for example polyoxethylene stearate), or condensation products of ethylene oxide with long chain aliphatic alcohols, for example heptadecaethyleneoxycetanol, or condensation products of ethylene oxide with partial esters derived from fatty acids and a hexitol such as polyoxyethylene sorbitol monooleate, or condensation products of ethylene oxide with partial esters derived from fatty acids and hexitol anhydrides, for example polyethylene sorbitan monooleate. The aqueous suspensions can also contain one or more preservatives (such as ethyl or propyl p-hydroxybenzoate, anti-oxidants (such as ascorbic acid), coloring agents, flavoring agents, and\/or sweetening agents (such as sucrose, saccharine or aspartame).","Oily suspensions can be formulated by suspending the active ingredient in a vegetable oil (such as arachis oil, olive oil, sesame oil or coconut oil) or in a mineral oil (such as liquid paraffin). The oily suspensions can also contain a thickening agent such as beeswax, hard paraffin or cetyl alcohol. Sweetening agents such as those set out above, and flavoring agents can be added to provide a palatable oral preparation. These compositions can be preserved by the addition of an anti-oxidant such as ascorbic acid.","Dispersible powders and granules for preparation of an aqueous suspension by the addition of water generally contain the active ingredient together with a dispersing or wetting agent, suspending agent and one or more preservatives. Dispersing or wetting agents and suspending agents are exemplified by those already mentioned above. Additional excipients such as sweetening, flavoring and coloring agents, can also be present.","The pharmaceutical compositions of the invention can also be in the form of oil-in-water emulsions. The oily phase can be a vegetable oil, such as olive oil or arachis oil, or a mineral oil, such as for example liquid paraffin or a mixture of any of these.
