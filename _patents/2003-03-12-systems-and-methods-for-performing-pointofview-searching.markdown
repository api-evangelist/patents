title: Systems and methods for performing point-of-view searching
abstract: A system provides search results relating to a point-of-view (POV). The system obtains a search query and POV data. The system generates a list of documents based on the search query and filters the list of documents based on the POV data. Alternatively, the system may perform a search based on the search query and the POV data to generate the list of documents. In either case, the system then presents the list of documents as the result of the search.

Field of the Invention","The present invention relates generally to information retrieval systems and, more particularly, to systems and methods for performing point-of-view searching.","2. Description of Related Art","Conventional techniques for searching, such as for searching a hypertext medium such as the World Wide Web (\u201cweb\u201d), are replete with deficiencies. For example, current search engines permit only key word searching, possibly extended by features, such as restricting the answer set to a given domain or a given host.","One technique permits a user to specify one or a set of Uniform Resource Locators (URLs) as \u201cauthoritative.\u201d Similarly, another set can be specified as lacking in authority. This technique is based on finding hubs and authorities via the Hyperlink-Induced Topic Search (HITS) algorithm. The underlying information used for the computation is a co-citation index. The goal of the technique is to modify the co-citation index in such a way that the \u201cauthority\u201d increases for positive examples and decreases for negative examples. Thus, the authority of other URLs can be changed.","There are two main problems with this approach. First, the co-citation index must be computed, which limits the size of the underlying link graph. For this and other reasons, the link graph is restricted to documents in the neighborhood of documents containing search query terms. For an arbitrary query, the likelihood that a \u201cgood\u201d or \u201cbad\u201d example URL is in this small neighborhood is remote. Furthermore, the underlying HITS algorithm has numerous shortcomings (e.g., topic drift and spammability) which may affect the performance of this technique.","As a result, there exists a need for a mechanism that provides search results that are related to a defined set of information, such as URLs.","Systems and methods consistent with the present invention address this and other needs by providing mechanisms for limiting results of a search query to documents related to a given set of information, such as URLs. As a result, a user may be presented with more relevant search results. As used herein, the term \u201cdocuments\u201d is to be interpreted broadly to include any type of paper or electronic data or file, including audio, video, image, text data\/files, etc. As will be appreciated by those skilled in the art, a document, as used herein, may be a single file or a combination of files with or without embedded links to other files.","In accordance with the principles of the invention as embodied and broadly described herein, a system provides search results relating to a point-of-view (POV). The system obtains a search query and POV data. The system generates a list of documents based on the search query and filters the list of documents based on the POV data. The system then presents the filtered list as a result of the search.","According to another implementation consistent with the present invention, a system provides search results relating to a POV. The system receives a search query from a user, obtains POV data, and uses the POV data to augment the search query. The system identifies documents based on the augmented search query and presents the identified documents to the user.","According to yet another implementation consistent with the present invention, a method for performing a search from a POV includes receiving a request for a search; obtaining POV data that defines the POV for the search; performing a search of documents based on the POV data; generating a list of documents as a result of the search; and presenting the list of documents.","The following detailed description of the invention refers to the accompanying drawings. The same reference numbers in different drawings may identify the same or similar elements. Also, the following detailed description does not limit the invention. Instead, the invention is defined by the appended claims and equivalents.","Systems and methods consistent with the present invention provide search results to a point-of-view (POV). A POV may be defined by key words, a set of addresses or Uniform Resource Locators (URLs), or other information. For example, such other information may include a user's browsing history (including information such as sites or documents visited and amount of time spent), categories specified by a user or otherwise derived from user interactions such as search history, browsing history, etc., word vectors derived from sites or documents visited and various well-known information retrieval (IR) techniques, etc. POV searching may also be thought of as personalized searching, in which case POV data may correspond to personalization data, such as the types of information described above or many other types of data. As a result, the user is presented with more relevant results than obtained by conventional information retrieval systems.",{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0024","num":"0023"},"figref":["FIG. 1","FIG. 1"],"b":["100","100","110","120","130","140","140","110","120","130","140"]},"The clients  may include devices, such as wireless telephones, personal computers, personal digital assistants (PDAs), lap tops, or other types of communication devices, threads or processes running on these devices, and\/or objects executable by these devices. The servers - may include server devices, threads, and\/or objects that operate upon, search, maintain, or manage documents in a manner consistent with the present invention. The clients  and servers - may connect to the network  via wired, wireless, or optical connections.","In an implementation consistent with the present invention, the server  may include a search engine  usable by the clients . The servers  may store or manage documents, such as web documents or web pages, accessible by the clients  and the server .",{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0027","num":"0026"},"figref":"FIG. 2","b":["120","120","210","220","230","240","250","260","270","280","210","120"]},"The processor  may include any type of conventional processor or microprocessor that interprets and executes instructions. The main memory  may include a random access memory (RAM) or another type of dynamic storage device that stores information and instructions for execution by the processor . The ROM  may include a conventional ROM device or another type of static storage device that stores static information and instructions for use by the processor . The storage device  may include a magnetic and\/or optical recording medium and its corresponding drive.","The input devices  may include one or more conventional mechanisms that permit an operator to input information to the server , such as a keyboard, a mouse, a pen, voice recognition and\/or biometric mechanisms, etc. The output devices  may include one or more conventional mechanisms that output information to the operator, including a display, a printer, a speaker, etc. The communication interface  may include any transceiver-like mechanism that enables the server  to communicate with other devices and\/or systems. For example, the communication interface  may include mechanisms for communicating with another device or system via a network, such as network .","As will be described in detail below, the server , consistent with the present invention, perform certain searching-related operations. The server  may perform these operations in response to processor  executing software instructions contained in a computer-readable medium, such as memory . A computer-readable medium may be defined as one or more memory devices and\/or carrier waves.","The software instructions may be read into memory  from another computer-readable medium, such as the data storage device , or from another device via the communication interface . The software instructions contained in memory  causes processor  to perform processes that will be described later. Alternatively, hardwired circuitry may be used in place of or in combination with software instructions to implement processes consistent with the present invention. Thus, the present invention is not limited to any specific combination of hardware circuitry and software.",{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0032","num":"0031"},"figref":"FIG. 3","b":["120","230","230","250","230","310","320","330","340","350"]},"The operating system  may include conventional operating system software, such as the Windows, Unix, or Linux operating systems. The search engine software  may include software for implementing the search engine . The search engine  may identify one or more documents or a list of documents in response to a request, such as one or more search terms, from a user. For example, the search engine  may receive a search query from a user and respond by returning relevant information or a list of relevant information to the user. Typically, users may ask the server  to locate web documents relating to a particular topic that are stored at other devices or systems connected to network  or another network. The search engine  may access a database to obtain results from a document corpus, stored in the database, by comparing the terms in the user's search query to the documents in the corpus. The information in the document corpus may be gathered by the spider software .","The spider software  may include software that \u201ccrawls\u201d web documents on network  based on their hyperlinks. As a result, the spider software  generates a tree or directed graph of linked web documents. The crawled documents may be stored in the database as an inverted index in which each term in the corpus is associated with all the crawled documents that contain that term.",{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0035","num":"0034"},"figref":"FIG. 4","b":["330","410","430"]},"In , documents - contain various links. In particular, document  contains one backlink to document  and two forward links (i.e., one to document  and one to document ). Document  contains two backlinks (i.e., one to document  and one to document ). Document  contains one backlink to document  and two forward links (i.e., one to document  and one to document ).","Returning to , the miscellaneous other software  and miscellaneous data  may include programs and data used by the server  to perform searching-related and non-searching-related operations. In some implementations, for example, the miscellaneous data  may include the document corpus gathered by the spider software . In other implementations, the corpus is stored in a memory external to the server .",{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0038","num":"0037"},"figref":["FIG. 5","FIG. 1"],"b":["120","110","125","120","510"]},"The search engine  may obtain POV data from the user, the browser software, or elsewhere (act ). In one implementation, the POV data may include a set of URLs that act as examples of on-topic or off-topic documents. For example, a user may specify URLs related to jaguars, but add negative URLs related to Jaguar brand cars. In another implementation, the URL of the document currently displayed by the browser software may be used as an example of an on-topic URL. In yet another implementation, the browser software may provide the URLs included in the user's \u201cbookmarks\u201d or \u201cfavorites\u201d list to the search engine  for use as examples of on-topic URLs. In this case, the browser software may automatically provide the list of URLs to the search engine  or may present the list to the user for selection of one or more of the URLs prior to providing the list to the search engine .","In another implementation, a database may include URLs that the user has previously selected (e.g., clicked on), that were returned in the top N results of a previous query by the user, that the user has visited recently or in some time period, etc., or that can be determined to be related to such URLs. As used herein, the term \u201crecently\u201d may refer to an absolute time period (such as within the last M minutes, where M can be a predetermined number or a number that is calculated dynamically, e.g., according to the user's browsing habits and browsing history). Alternatively, \u201crecently\u201d may also be a relative measure. For example, recently viewed documents may refer to the last Y number of documents viewed, regardless of the time when the documents were viewed. Of course, \u201crecently\u201d may also refer to a combination of absolute and relative measures. These URLs can be added to the POV data. Alternatively, the URLs can first be filtered to determine whether they are on-topic. Those URLs that are on-topic can be added to the POV data. As another alternative, the URLs in the database can be clustered by topic. When the user performs the POV search, the clusters that are relevant to the topic of the search can be identified and the URLs from the relevant clusters can be added to the POV data.","In an implementation consistent with the present invention, the search engine  may perform one or more operations to expand the set of on-topic URLs. For example, the search engine  may obtain a few key words, either from the examples of on-topic URLs or from the user. The search engine  may then perform a search to obtain a collection of additional on-topic URLs. The search engine  may then add these additional URLs to the set of on-topic URLs. According to another implementation, the search engine  may identify URLs that are co-cited with the set of on-topic URLs. The search engine  may then add the co-cited URLs to the set of on-topic URLs.","In an alternate implementation, the POV data may include one or more words that identify on-topic or off-topic documents. The search engine  may obtain the words from an example set of URLs, from the user (either explicitly or implicitly), from personalization data, or from various techniques, such as those disclosed previously. For example, a user may specify positive and\/or negative key words that identify URLs that are on-topic or off-topic.","In yet another implementation, the POV data may include a category or list of categories. The category may correspond to categories within a hierarchical directory, such as an open directory, maintained by the search engine  or by another device or server. For example, the search engine  may maintain a hierarchical directory based on periodic crawling of the network  by the spider software . For each category in the hierarchical directory, the search engine  may record a list of URLs and other information that correspond to that category. The search engine  may present a selectable list of categories to the user.","In a further implementation, the POV data may include data relating to one or more searches that the user has previously performed and\/or key words from documents (e.g., web pages or their anchor text) that the user has selected (e.g., clicked on) or that were returned in the top N results for a search by the user. This data may be stored in a database. When the user performs a POV search, the key words can be used to automatically augment the query. For example, if the user has previously performed a search for \u201ctigers\u201d and \u201celephants,\u201d then \u201cmammals\u201d might be one of the key words extracted based on the search. When the user later performs a POV search \u201cjaguar,\u201d then \u201cmammals\u201d might be automatically added to the search query.",{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0045","num":"0044"},"figref":"FIG. 6","b":["600","600","610","620","600","630","640","125","600","650"]},"Returning to , the search engine  may generate data that contains the search results in a conventional manner (act ). In an implementation consistent with the present invention, the search engine  provides the search results as an HTML document, similar to search results provided by conventional search engines. Alternatively, the search engine  may provide the search results according to a protocol agreed upon by the server  and the client .","In an implementation consistent with the present invention, the search results include references (e.g., links) to documents (e.g., web pages) and possibly a textual description of the links. In another implementation, the search results include references (e.g., links) to directory nodes within a hierarchical directory and possibly textual descriptions for the directory nodes. In other implementations, the search results include a combination of these references or the documents themselves.","If a POV search has been specified, as described above (e.g., the user has entered information via GUI ), the search engine  may filter the result links to present links related to the POV data (act ). While the filtering is being described as an act separate from the act of generating the list of result links, these two acts may be concurrently performed as part of the same act.",{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0049","num":"0048"},"figref":"FIG. 7","b":"125"},"Briefly, the PageRank\u2122 of a web document is the probability that a web surfer who is surfing at random will be at a document at any time. In other words, the PageRank\u2122 is the stationary distribution of the random walk process on a graph of the web. Since the web contains many sinks, where the walk cannot follow a forward link, a set of documents is assigned a non-zero \u201creset\u201d probability and whenever a sink is reached, the walk \u201cjumps\u201d to a randomly selected document in the set, according to the reset probabilities in the set. The reset probability of a document is the probability of landing on that document during a random reset.","According to one implementation of the PageRank\u2122 method, the backlinks from different documents are weighted differently and the number of links in each document is normalized. The PageRank\u2122 method considers a citation from a highly ranked backlink as more important than a citation from a lowly ranked backlink (provided both citations come from backlink documents that have an equal number of forward links). According to the PageRank\u2122 method, it is possible for a document with only one backlink (from a very highly ranked document) to have a higher rank than another document with many backlinks (from very low ranked documents).","The rank or score of a document may be defined according to:",{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0053","num":"0052"},"maths":{"@attributes":{"id":"MATH-US-00001","num":"00001"},"math":{"@attributes":{"overflow":"scroll"},"mrow":{"mrow":{"mrow":[{"mi":"r","mo":"\u2061","mrow":{"mo":["(",")"],"mi":"A"}},{"mrow":[{"mi":"\u03b1","mo":"*","mfrac":{"mrow":{"mi":"i","mo":"\u2061","mrow":{"mo":["(",")"],"mi":"A"}},"mi":"k"}},{"mrow":[{"mo":["(",")"],"mrow":{"mn":"1","mo":"-","mi":"\u03b1"}},{"mo":["(",")"],"mrow":{"mfrac":[{"mrow":[{"mi":"r","mo":"\u2061","mrow":{"mo":["(",")"],"msub":{"mi":"B","mn":"1"}}},{"mo":["\uf603","\uf604"],"msub":{"mi":"B","mn":"1"}}]},{"mrow":[{"mi":"r","mo":"\u2061","mrow":{"mo":["(",")"],"msub":{"mi":["B","n"]}}},{"mo":["\uf603","\uf604"],"msub":{"mi":["B","n"]}}]}],"mo":["+","+"],"mi":"\u2026"}}],"mo":"\u2062"}],"mo":"+"}],"mo":"="},"mo":","}}},"br":{},"sub":["1","n ","1","n","1","n","1","n","1","n"]},"The ranks form a probability distribution over web documents, so that the sum of ranks over all web documents is unity. The rank of a document can, therefore, be defined as the probability that a surfer will be at the document after following a large number of forward links. The constant \u03b1 in the above equation may be interpreted as the reset probability that the web surfer will jump randomly to any web page instead of following a forward link.","For the filtering process, the search engine  may set the reset probability of the URLs in the set of on-topic URLs to 1\/k, where k is the total number of URLs in the set (act ). The search engine  may set the reset probability of all other URLs to zero (act ).","Not all URLs need to be treated the same. For example, some URLs may be more on topic than others and may, therefore, be given a higher weight. A function f may be defined on the set of documents, such that","f(A)=0 if A is not in the set of on-topic URLs; and","f(A)=w(A) if A is in the set of on-topic URLs, where w(A) is the weight of the URL.","The sum of f(A) over all documents may equal one.","The rank or score of a document may then be defined according to:",{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0060","num":"0059"},"maths":{"@attributes":{"id":"MATH-US-00002","num":"00002"},"math":{"@attributes":{"overflow":"scroll"},"mrow":{"mrow":{"mrow":[{"mi":"r","mo":"\u2061","mrow":{"mo":["(",")"],"mi":"A"}},{"mrow":[{"mi":"\u03b1","mo":"*","mfrac":{"mrow":{"mi":"f","mo":"\u2061","mrow":{"mo":["(",")"],"mi":"A"}},"mi":"k"}},{"mrow":[{"mo":["(",")"],"mrow":{"mn":"1","mo":"-","mi":"\u03b1"}},{"mo":["(",")"],"mrow":{"mfrac":[{"mrow":[{"mi":"r","mo":"\u2061","mrow":{"mo":["(",")"],"msub":{"mi":"B","mn":"1"}}},{"mo":["\uf603","\uf604"],"msub":{"mi":"B","mn":"1"}}]},{"mrow":[{"mi":"r","mo":"\u2061","mrow":{"mo":["(",")"],"msub":{"mi":["B","n"]}}},{"mo":["\uf603","\uf604"],"msub":{"mi":["B","n"]}}]}],"mo":["+","+"],"mi":"\u2026"}}],"mo":"\u2062"}],"mo":"+"}],"mo":"="},"mo":","}}},"br":{},"sub":["1","n","1","n","1","n"]},"The search engine  may then score the result links using one of the ranking methods described above (act ). The rank flows from the documents corresponding to the example URLs to all other documents. Documents that are easily reached from the example documents obtain a high rank. As a result, documents close to the example documents are likely to be returned higher in the rankings for queries to which they match. The search engine  may then arrange the documents in the result links based on their scores (act ).","In an alternate implementation consistent with the present invention, the relative probabilities of traversing links within the web graph may be changed. For example, if a link leads toward documents that are on-topic, then it may be favored over links that lead toward documents that are off-topic. Various methods, including local optimization methods, may be used to compute appropriate edge probabilities to maximize the POV of the web graph. For example, the weights w(A) may be modified based on favored and\/or unfavored links to maximize the POV.","In yet another implementation consistent with the present invention, the on-topic URLs may be added to the filtered results. For example, the best result might be one that the user saw before and was in the on-topic URLs, but not in the search results.","Returning to , the search engine  may then present the filtered results to the user (act ). The search engine  may also rank the results in some manner, such as by assigning scores to the links or by alphabetizing them.","The search engine  may present the filtered result links as a web page in a browser window. Alternatively, the search engine  may present the filtered result links as a list of selectable items within a user interface, such as a pull-down or pop-up menu, a side-bar, or a scrollable list.","If the search engine  implements a directory hierarchy, the results of a search may include a list of top ranked directory hierarchy nodes. In this case, the search engine  may download the links corresponding to the top ranked directory hierarchy nodes and display them instead of or in addition to the text of the top ranked directory hierarchy nodes.","Systems and methods consistent with the present invention permit a user to limit search results to a defined POV, such as documents related to an example set of URLs.
