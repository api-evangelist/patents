title: Rapid deployment soft restraint apparatus and method
abstract: An apparatus and method for rapidly restraining a person's limbs are disclosed. The inventive apparatus includes a pair of cuff modules, each with three rigid loops positioned on their outer surface, and a cuff interconnect having a flexible elongated body sized and configured to fit through the rigid loops, that is attached to one of the rigid loops on one of the cuff modules. When the cuff modules are applied to the person's limbs, the interconnect body is threaded through the other rigid loops and around the person's midsection, such that the interconnect body surrounds the person's midsection from front and back and forms two tension zones, one at each of the cuff modules to significantly restrict the range of motion of the person's first and second limbs. Optionally, the cuff modules may include releasable connectors to releasable connect to corresponding external stationary restraints. An optional additional set of two cuff modules with a second interconnect may be provided for securing the person's other limbs. The additional cuff module set and second interconnect is provided with a releasable connector for releasably connecting to an external restraint system.

{"@attributes":{"id":"description"},"RELAPP":[{},{}],"heading":["REFERENCE TO PREVIOUSLY FILED APPLICATIONS","BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION","SUMMARY OF THE INVENTION","DESCRIPTION OF THE PREFERRED EMBODIMENTS"],"p":["The present patent application is a continuation-in-part of a previously filed commonly assigned U.S. patent application Ser. No.: 10\/044,148 entitled \u201cRapid Deployment Soft Restraint Apparatus and Method\u201d filed on Jan. 11, 2002, which in turn claims priority from U.S. Provisional Patent Application Ser. No.: 60\/261,533, entitled \u201cRapid Deployment Soft Restraint Apparatus and Method\u201d filed on Jan. 13, 2001.","The present invention is directed to a soft mechanical restraint system that may be easily and quickly deployed by a first person on a subject being held in a restrained position by a second person.","There are many thousands of human service and law enforcement agencies and facilities that provide care and supervision to aggressive, suicidal, and emotionally disturbed persons (hereinafter commonly referred to as \u201cEDPs\u201d). The staff and officers working in these agencies regularly come into physical contact with the EDPs through the use of physical subduing or restraint holds when the EDP becomes aggressive. Although there are many types of well-known physical subduing holds, the safest and most advantageous physical subduing hold is a Primary Restraint Technique (PRT) described in greater detail in a commonly assigned U.S. Pat. No. 6,273,091 entitled \u201cAPPARATUS AND METHOD FOR SAFELY MAINTAINING A RESTRAINING HOLD ON A PERSON\u201d.","While restraint holds are useful for relatively short periods of time, often restraint of the EDP is necessary for an extended period. In such cases, the EDP must be restrained using some sort of a mechanical restraint system. Typically this involves placing wrist and ankle mechanical restraints on the EDP so that the EDP may be restrained for an extended period of time at the place of the restraint hold, or transported to another location while wearing the restraints. Most previously known restraint systems involve mechanical locks\u2014for example, one popular restraint utilizes a mechanical spring-loaded lock that requires a special key to open. It takes at least 4-5 staff members to successfully apply such restraints at a speed of no lower than 2-3 minutes per restraint. During the application of these restraints, the EDP must be held down and poses a constant threat to the staff members until the restraining process is complete. Furthermore, removal of such restraints in emergency situations (i.e. in a medical emergency) takes a significant amount of time since a key must be located and used to open each restraint on each limb\u2014this is especially problematic because without the key, which may not be immediately available in case of an emergency, the restraints cannot be removed at all. Finally, such complex restraint systems are expensive, heavy, and require extensive training to use properly.","Certain more recently developed restraints include mechanical locks based on a belt-like mechanism similar to a clothing belt with a buckle and a portion of the restraint having holes therein. Other similar restraints include a protruding metal member on one portion of the restraint and slots cut into the body of the restraint such that when the restraint is applied to the EDP, the portion with slots is pulled over the portion with the metal member until the restraint is tightened and the metal member is pushed through one of the slots. The end section of the slot portion may be further secured to the restraint. One of the main drawbacks with this arrangement is the fact that it is impossible to fit the restraint exactly to the hand or foot of the EDP since the restraint can only be tightened in increments equal to distance between the slots. As a result, it is possible that the restraint will be too loose (making it easier for the EDP to remove their limb from the restraint), or too tight (posing a danger of cutting off blood flow to the limb). Furthermore, a struggling unsupervised EDP may be able to loosen the restraint by pushing the slot portion of the restraint away from the metal member. Finally, all types of above restraints require special custom-made connectors to connect to one another or to stationary positions (i.e. a bed, etc.).","Manipulation of the previously known restraints once attached is difficult as well, requiring several people to pull webbing through complex system of buckles and connectors to connect cuff restraints to one another. And often, once an EDP is moved to a stationary restraint area, the restraints used during EDP transport must be removed and replaced with stationary restraints.","The above problems and challenges are at least partially advantageously solved by a novel circular cuff module that may be applied to each of an EDP's limbs quickly (and removed therefrom) by staff members without use of complex locking mechanisms as disclosed in a commonly assigned co-pending U.S. patent application entitled \u201cSoft Circular Restraint Apparatus and Method\u201d incorporated herein by reference in its entirety. Several advantageous approaches to interconnecting the novel cuff modules are disclosed as well.","However, one of the main challenges of previously known restraint systems, including the one disclosed in the above-incorporated \u201cSoft Circular Restraint Apparatus and Method\u201d patent application, is in how the cuff restraints are connected to one another. While connecting ankle cuff modules to one another by a simple interconnect may serve to prevent the EDP from kicking and to limit the EDP's walking speed, application of a simple wrist interconnect may pose a problem with particularly violent and\/or aggressive EDPs. Similarly, while a simple wrist interconnect may prevent the EDP from using their hands independently from one another, the EDP is not prevented from flailing their arms at elbows and shoulders if the restrained wrists are at the EDP's front, and thus the EDP may still attack staff members even if the wrists are pulled together. Securing the EDP's wrists behind their back is a partial solution, but a nimble EDP can contort themselves to move their wrists to the front of their body. While some attempts have been made to develop more secure wrist interconnects, invariably these devices are cumbersome, heavy, and expensive to manufacture. Most importantly, the complexity of such devices require several staff members to apply them to EDPs. Unfortunately, this also means that such restraints are very difficult and time consuming to remove from the EDP in case of an emergency.","With respect to ankle restraints, while the novel circular cuff modules, disclosed in the above-incorporated patent application, include connectors to releasably connect to stationary connectors (such as may be disposed on a bed), other types of ankle modules and respective interconnects do not possess any mechanism to connect to stationary connectors.","Thus, it would be desirable to provide an apparatus and method for quickly and easily applying mechanical restraints to a person being controlled through a restraining hold or who is otherwise immobile. It would furthermore be desirable to provide a mechanical restraint apparatus that is comfortable to the subject and that may be quickly and easily removed in case of an emergency. It would additionally be desirable to provide a mechanical restraint system that severely restricts the range of motion of the person's arms. It would further be desirable to provide a mechanical restraint system that can be attached to commonly available stationary connectors. It would also be desirable to provide a lightweight mechanical restraint system that is easy to transport and use and that is inexpensive to manufacture. Moreover, it would be desirable to provide a mechanical restraint system that may be easily controlled by a single person during and after its application.","The apparatus of the present invention, and method of use thereof, remedies the problems associated with applying mechanical restraints to violent and\/or struggling EDPs (and with removing the restraints therefrom). In brief summary, the inventive rapid deployment restraint apparatus advantageously provides: (1) quick and easy application to the EDP as well as quick and easy removal in case of an emergency; (2) severe restriction to the range of motion of the EDPs arms; (3) a secure fit to any EDP size as the inventive restraint apparatus is dynamically fitted exactly to the EDP size during application thereof; (4) optional easy attachment to commonly available stationary connectors, such as seat belt connectors; (5) lightweight and simple construction, making the inventive restraints easy to transport and use, and inexpensive to manufacture; and (6) easy control of the restraint apparatus by a single person during and after its application to the EDP.","The inventive apparatus includes an arm restraint system with a pair of cuff modules, each with three rigid loops positioned on their outer surface, and a first cuff interconnect having a first flexible elongated body, sized and configured to fit through the rigid loops, that is attached to one of the rigid loops on one of the cuff modules. When the cuff modules are applied to the EDP's wrists, the first body is threaded through the other rigid loops and around the EDP's midsection, such that the first body surrounds the EDP's midsection from front and back, such that when the first body is threaded through two loops on each cuff module and around the EDP's midsection, a tensioning arrangement is created that secures the first body around the EDP's midsection, such that the range of motion of the EDP's first and second limbs is significantly restricted. Optionally, the cuff modules may include releasable connectors to releasably connect to corresponding external stationary restraints.","An optional leg restraint system, that includes an additional set of two cuff modules and a second interconnect with second elongated body connecting the additional cuff modules to one another, may be provided for securing the EDPs ankles and restricting the motion of the EDPs legs. The leg restraint system is provided with a releasable connector positioned on the second body for releasably connecting to an external restraint system. Additional embodiments of the leg restraint system include releasable connectors for releasably connecting the second body to the additional cuff modules, and optional tensioning devices for controlling the length of the second body, and thus the distance between the additional cuff modules.","Other objects and features of the present invention will become apparent from the following detailed description considered in conjunction with the accompanying drawings. It is to be understood, however, that the drawings are designed solely for purposes of illustration and not as a definition of the limits of the invention, for which reference should be made to the appended claims.","The present invention relates to an advantageous soft mechanical restraint apparatus and method that may be quickly and easily applied by a first person to a subject being held in a restraining hold by a second person, or to a subject who is otherwise immobilized (e.g. unconscious, sedated, asleep, etc.).","It should be understood that while the present invention refers to Emotionally Disturbed Persons (hereinafter \u201cEDPs\u201d) and staff members, the inventive techniques and apparatus may be applied in virtually any situation where a subject is being restrained and application of mechanical restraints is warranted. Thus, the present invention is applicable in law enforcement, hospitals, mental health care facilities, drug and alcohol rehabilitation centers, etc.","Before application of any sort of mechanical restraints, it is important that control over a struggling EDP is established by placing the EDP into a restraining hold. The Primary Restraint Technique (hereinafter \u201cPRT\u201d) is an advantageous modular single person restraint that is applied by an EDP care professional (hereinafter \u201cstaff member\u201d) to an EDP from behind. The maneuvers involved in implementing the PRT are described in greater detail in Primary Restraint Technique (PRT) described in greater detail in a commonly assigned U.S. Pat. No. 6,273,091 entitled \u201cAPPARATUS AND METHOD FOR SAFELY MAINTAINING A RESTRAINING HOLD ON A PERSON\u201d which is hereby incorporated by reference in its entirety. It should be noted however that the restraint system of the present invention does not require use of the PRT\u2014it may be advantageously be utilized in any situation where the EDP is physically restrained by one or more staff members or other individuals. Of course if the EDP is not ambulatory (i.e. unconscious or asleep), it is not necessary to apply any restraint holds before application of the inventive restraint apparatus.","In summary, the restraint apparatus of the present invention comprises an arm restraint system with a cuff module for each wrist, and a flexible first interconnect for connecting the wrist cuff modules to one another, and a leg restraint system with a cuff module for each ankle and a flexible second interconnect for connecting the ankle cuff modules to one another. It should be understood to one skilled in the art that the arm and leg restraint systems can be readily utilized independently from one another without departing from the spirit of the invention. For example, in certain situations only the arm restraint system may be used, while in another situation, only the leg restraint system may be utilized.","Furthermore, while the arm and leg restraint systems of the inventive apparatus are described below and shown in the drawings as applied to arms and legs respectively, it should be apparent to one skilled in the art that the arm restraint system can be applied to the EDP's legs and the leg restraint system can be applied to the EDPs arms without departing from the spirit of the present invention. The key factor in such an application of the restraint apparatus is the size of the cuff modules. So if the first interconnect is to be used to secure the EDP's legs, it should be connected to ankle-sized cuff modules, similarly, if the second interconnect is to be used to secure the EDP's arms, it should be connected to wrist-sized cuff modules.","It should be noted that all directions of how cuff module interconnects are threaded through, and connected to, various elements of the cuff modules, are shown and described by way of example only and may be easily be reversed without departing from the spirit of the invention.","Referring now to , an arm restraint system  is shown in a storage\/transport configuration. The arm restraint system , includes a first cuff module , a second cuff module  and an interconnect  therebetween. Preferably, the cuff modules  and  are those described in the co-pending commonly assigned U.S. patent application entitled \u201cSoft Circular Restraint Apparatus and Method\u201d, which is hereby incorporated by reference in its entirety, but modified with two additional rigid loops added proximal to one of the rigid loops on each cuff module. The cuff modules from the above-incorporated \u201cSoft Circular Restraint Apparatus and Method\u201d patent application, and their utilization with the inventive arm restraint system  are described in greater detail below in connection with .","However, the arm restraint system  may be utilized with a set of any other generally circular cuff modules (for example, any commercially available resilient cuff restraints) as long as each cuff module includes (or is modified to include) three rigid loops on its outer surface positioned apart from one another when the cuff module is in a closed or deployed position as described below. It should be noted that the cuff modules ,  are shown in simplified views in the various figures and may include additional elements (such as locking mechanisms) that are not shown in the figures because such additional elements are not relevant to the present invention. Moreover, the additional pair of rigid loops may be placed away from the other rigid loop without departing from the spirit of the invention.","Furthermore, while the various embodiments of the inventive restraint apparatus are described with references to particular hook and loop material strips positioned on various portions of the inventive first and second interconnects, any loop and hook material strips may be interchanged between one another throughout the first and second interconnects, as long as the interchange is consistent overall, as a matter of design choice.","A first rigid loop  is positioned perpendicular to an outer surface of a cuff body  of the cuff module . The rigid loop  is preferably generally rectangular and composed of a strong material such as metal, hard plastic, or metal coated with a resilient material. The opening in the rigid loop  is sized and configured to allow the interconnect  to readily pass therethrough. Preferably, the rigid loop  has a limited range of pivoting motion about its lower portion by which it is attached to the cuff body , however, the rigid loop  may also be secured in a non-movable, or a very limited pivot position perpendicular to the cuff body .","A pair of rigid loops ,  are positioned perpendicular to the top surface of the cuff body  at a first predetermined distance away from the rigid loop . The rigid loops ,  are preferably identical to the rigid loop , being generally rectangular and composed of a strong material such as metal, hard plastic, or metal coated with a resilient material. The openings in the rigid loops ,  are sized and configured to allow the interconnect  to readily pass therethrough in a tensioning configuration. Preferably, the rigid loops ,  have a limited range of pivoting motion about their lower portions by which they are attached to the cuff body . However, the rigid loops ,  may also be secured in a non-movable or a very limited pivot position perpendicular to the cuff body . The first predetermined distance between the rigid loops , and ,  may be selected as a matter of design choice, but is preferably approximately between one third to one half of the external circumference of the cuff body .","A rigid loop  is positioned perpendicular to an outer surface of a cuff body  of the cuff module . The rigid loop  is preferably generally rectangular and composed of a strong material such as metal, hard plastic, or metal coated with a resilient material. The opening in the rigid loop  is sized and configured to allow the interconnect  to readily pass therethrough. Preferably, the rigid loop  has a limited range of pivoting motion about its lower portion by which it is attached to the cuff body , however the rigid loop  may also be secured in a non-movable or a very limited pivot position perpendicular to the cuff body .","A pair of rigid loops ,  is positioned perpendicular to the top surface of the cuff body  at the first predetermined distance away from the rigid loop , The rigid loops ,  are preferably identical to the third rigid loop , being generally rectangular and composed of a strong material such as metal, hard plastic, or metal coated with a resilient material. The openings in the rigid loops ,  are sized and configured to allow the interconnect  to readily pass therethrough. Preferably, the rigid loops ,  have a limited range of pivoting motion about their lower portion by which they is attached to the cuff body . However, the rigid loops ,  may also be secured in a non-movable or a very limited pivot position perpendicular to the cuff body . The first predetermined distance between the rigid loops  and ,  may be selected as a matter of design choice but is preferably approximately one third to one half of the external circumference of the cuff body .","Referring now to , the interconnect  is shown from a bottom view () and a top view (FIG. F). The interconnect  is an elongated body composed of a strong flexible material such as nylon webbing (for example, of the type used in seat belts and parachute straps) with a top surface and a bottom surface, a first end and a second end. The interconnect  includes a connector  for connection to one of the rigid loops of the cuff modules ,  at the first end and an optional stiffening element  positioned on its second end. The interconnect  also includes a rigid loop  positioned perpendicularly to its surface, such that when the system  is deployed, the rigid loop  is proximal to an EDP's midsection side.","The connector  may be a simple loop of a portion of the interconnect  pulled through one of the rigid loops of the cuff modules ,  and secured to itself, or another configuration of a permanent connector that connects to one of the rigid loops. Optionally, the connector  may be a releasable connector that enables the first end of the interconnect  to be releasably connected to one of the rigid loops of the cuff modules , . Any known configuration of a releasable connector may be used. A novel embodiment of a connector  that may be advantageously used as a releasable connector with the interconnect  is described below in connection with  to C.","The stiffening element  may be composed of additional webbing, plastic lining, or another resilient material. While the stiffening element  is not essential, it serves to facilitate threading of the interconnect  through the various rigid loops of the cuff modules , .","Optionally, a loop material strip  (such as loop Velcro\u00ae) is positioned on the top surface of the interconnect  near the stiffening element  The loop material strip  is preferably a small strip approximately as wide as the interconnect . An optional hook material strip  (such as hook Velcro\u00ae) may be positioned either on top or on bottom of the connector  for releasably connecting to a portion of the loop material strip  if the second end of the interconnect  is brought into contact with the connector  after it is folded. While the above elements  and  are described with reference to either hook or loop material, it should be understood to one skilled in the art that any other flexible releasable attachment devices can be readily substituted for the hook and loop material without departing from the spirit of the invention. For example, the elements ,  may be replaced with releasable glue strips or the like.","The interconnect  also includes optional elastic loops  and  disposed between the first end and the loop material strip , and preferably closer to the first end. The elastic loops  and  may be composed of resilient elastic webbing, rubber or similar material, and either encompass a central axis of the interconnect  and thus freely slide along the interconnect , or are secured to either the top or the bottom surface of the interconnect  (as shown in , B, C and E) as a matter of design choice without departing from the spirit of the invention. Furthermore, either a single elastic loop or three or more elastic loops may be positioned on the interconnect  and used as a matter of design choice without departing from the spirit of the invention.","Returning now to , to place the arm restraint system  in a storage\/transport position, the interconnect  is attached to the rigid loop  of the cuff module  via the connector , extended toward the rigid loops ,  of the cuff module  and threaded through one or both loops , . The interconnect  is then folded back upon itself several times and secured in the folded state by the elastic loops  and . The amount of times the interconnect  is folded upon itself depends on the desired distance between the cuff modules ,  during storage\/transport. Thus, if the cuff modules ,  are to be close to one another, the interconnect  should be folded several times. The hook and loop material strips ,  serve to further secure the interconnect  in the storage position.","Referring now to  to D, the deployment of the arm restraint system  is shown in three stages. Referring to , the arm restraint system  is released from the storage\/transport configuration (shown in ) and pulled apart such that the interconnect  is threaded through the rigid loop  of the cuff module  from bottom to top and folded back upon itself extending toward the cuff module  and threaded again through the rigid loop . The rigid loop  creates a comfort zone for the restrained EDP by preventing the interconnect  from impacting the side of EDP's body  during the deployment of the system .","Preferably, before deployment on the EDP, the interconnect  is threaded straight through the rigid loops ,  and readily pulled (or let out) to adjust the distance between the cuff modules ,  to a desired value. This value depends on the width of the EDP's body . If the body  is wide, the distance between the cuff modules ,  should be greater than when the body  is narrow. The preferred method of application of the arm restraint system  is when the EDP is restrained face-down on a floor surface and is under control of a staff member (or when the EDP is sedated, asleep or unconscious and may be readily placed in a face-down position). The PRT system of the above-incorporated U.S. Pat. No. 6,273,091 patent is ideal for preparing the EDP for application of the arm restraint system  because one of the PRT positions involves placing the EDP face-down on a floor surface in a controlled hold.","However, the application of the arm restraint system  is described with reference to the EDP being face down on a floor surface by way of example only. It should be understood that the arm restraint system  may be applied to an EDP being face-up on the floor or in a standing position, as long as the EDP is immobilized during the application thereof, without departing from the spirit of the invention.","Referring now to , once the EDP is immobilized, the cuff module  is applied to one of EDP's wrists  (as shown in ) and the cuff module , along with a portion of the interconnect  that is between the cuff modules , , is passed under the EDP's body . The cuff module  is then secured to the EDP's other wrist , and then the interconnect  is pulled (through the rigid loops , , and ) to bring the EDP's wrists  closer to the EDP's body . The interconnect  is then folded back upon itself and threaded through the rigid loop  (thereby forming a first tensioning mechanism with the rigid loops , ) before being passed over the top of the body  and threaded straight through the rigid loops  and  from right to left. The interconnect  is then pulled through the rigid loops ,  until the EDP's wrists  are in tight contact with the sides of the EDP's body , and then folded back upon itself and threaded through the rigid loop  (thereby forming a second tensioning mechanism with the rigid loops , ) to extend over the EDP's body  in the direction of the cuff module , where optionally it may be tucked behind its section extending fully over the body . The two tensioning mechanisms secure the cuff modules ,  to the sides of the body  and prevent the EDP from being able to slide the cuff modules ,  along the interconnect .","As described above, the deployment of the arm restraint system  is quick and easy. Because of the advantageous construction and method of application of the inventive arm restraint system , the EDP has no leverage to move their arms. Advantageously, in case of an emergency, the arm restraint system  can be easily released by pulling on the second end of the interconnect  to detach the first loop material strip  from the first hook material strip , and threading the interconnect  back through the rigid loop  (and optionally through the rigid loop ) to completely release the EDP's arms.","The lightweight inventive arm restraint system  can withstand approximately 10,000 pounds of force, all without any metal key elements. This is due to the fact that the circular nature of the deployment and tensioning of the interconnect  through rigid loop pairs makes all EDP's movements self-canceling\u2014i.e. when the EDP pulls on one cuff module, the tension on the other cuff module is increased proportionally. Because all elements of the arm restraint system  are resilient, the EDP will not hurt themselves or experience significant discomfort by struggling against the system . It takes less than 25 seconds for a single person to deploy the arm restraint system  from its storage position (shown in ) to its deployed restraint position () Most importantly, the arm restraint system  can be easily released in one second in an emergency situation without need for a special key.","Referring now to  to C, an exemplary embodiment of the connector  is shown as a releasable connector . The releasable connector  includes a first elongated loop  positioned perpendicular to the top surface of the interconnect  at a predetermined distance from the first end of the interconnect , and a second elongated loop , positioned next to the elongated loop  and perpendicular to the top surface of the interconnect , at the same predetermined distance away from the first end. The elongated loops ,  may be composed of wire, plastic or an elastic material. The releasable connector  also includes a first hole  defined proximal to the first end, and a second hole , next to the hole , also defined proximal to the first end, the holes ,  being positioned and sized such that when the first end of the interconnect  is threaded through the rigid loop  from bottom to top and then folded upon itself, the holes ,  are aligned with the respective elongated loops , , such that the elongated loops ,  pass through the respective holes ,  to thereby at least temporarily connect the first end of the interconnect  to the rigid loop . The holes ,  may optionally be reinforced with rings (for example made from metal or plastic) as shown in .","The releasable connector  further includes a generally \u201cU-shaped\u201d connection element  having two segments, each sized and configured to fit though a respective elongated loop , , once the elongated loops ,  are passed through the respective holes , . The connection element  may be any strong thin material such as a wire or a hard plastic. Optionally, the connection element  may be coated with a resilient material to facilitate passage through the elongated loops , .","A retaining device , positioned proximal to the elongated loops , , receives and retains the first and second segments of the connection element  after they are passed through the elongated loops , . The retaining device  may be a cloth, plastic, or metal pocket attached to the top surface of the interconnect . An optional guide , such as a plastic, metal, or cloth member may be positioned centrally inside the retaining device  to guide the first and second segments of the connection element  into the retaining device . The releasable connector  is shown in a closed \u201cconnected\u201d position in , and in an open \u201creleased\u201d position in FIG. C.","As discussed before, the soft circular cuff modules from the above-incorporated \u201cSoft Circular Restraint Apparatus and Method\u201d patent application (hereafter \u201ccircular cuff modules\u201d) may advantageously be utilized in the arm restraint apparatus . Referring now to , a simplified view of a circular cuff module  is shown. The basic operation of the circular cuff module  involves placing it around an EDP's wrist and then threading a portion of the circular cuff module , terminating in a rigid connector , first through a rigid loop  and then through a rigid loop . Advantageously, the rigid connector  may be connected to an external stationary restraint system (not shown). The circular cuff module  is identical to the circular cuff module from the \u201cSoft Circular Restraint Apparatus and Method\u201d patent application, except that an additional pair of rigid loops ,  is added next to the rigid loop . Thus, the rigid loop  may used equivalently to the rigid loop  or the rigid loop  of the cuff modules ,  respectively, while the rigid loops ,  may used equivalently to the rigid loops ,  or the rigid loops ,  of the cuff modules ,  respectively. Referring now to , the restraint apparatus  is shown as deployed around the EDP's body  utilizing the circular cuff modules . Advantageously, the rigid connectors  may be used to secure the restrained EDP to an external stationary restraint system (not shown).","Referring now to , a first embodiment of a leg restraint system  of the present invention is shown. The leg restraint system , includes a first cuff module , a second cuff module , and an interconnect  therebetween. Preferably, the cuff modules  and  are similar to the circular cuff module  shown in  (and described in greater detail in the above incorporated \u201cSoft Circular Restraint Apparatus and Method\u201d patent application), except that the rigid loop  is not necessary.","However, the leg restraint system  may be utilized with a set of any other generally circular cuff modules (for example, any commercially available resilient cuff restraints) capable of connecting to an interconnect device. It should be noted that the cuff modules ,  are shown in simplified views in the various figures, and may include additional elements (such as locking mechanisms) that are not shown in the figures because such additional elements are not relevant to the present invention.","The interconnect  has its first end connected to a rigid loop  disposed on an outer surface of the cuff module , and its second end connected to a rigid loop  disposed on an outer surface of the cuff module . Optionally, the interconnect  may be attached to the cuff modules ,  in another manner. The length of the interconnect  may be selected as a matter of design choice. For example, if it is very short, the EDP will be unable to walk, while if it is long, the range of motion of EDP's legs will not be sufficiently restricted. In another example, the length of the interconnect  may be just sufficient for the EDP to walk in very small steps while being escorted by a staff member.","A releasable connector  is preferably attached perpendicular to one of the sides of the restraint interconnect  via a short strip . Preferably, the short strip  is positioned at a midpoint of the restraint interconnect  between the cuff modules , . The releasable connector  is configured to connect to an external stationary restraint system, shown as an external interconnect , having a connector  adapted for releasable connection to the connector . For example, the releasable connector  may be a female seat-belt type connector while the connector  may be a male seat-belt type connector. The strip  enables the releasable connector  to pivot in any direction perpendicular to the interconnect . A optional loop material strip  may be positioned on the interconnect  surface proximal to the short strip  and a hook material strip  may be positioned on a portion of the releasable connector  to releasably secure, via releasable connection with loop material strip , the releasable connector  to the interconnect  when the external interconnect  is connected thereto.","Referring now to , a second embodiment of the leg restraint system  of the present invention is shown as a leg restraint system . The leg restraint system , includes a first cuff module , a second cuff module , and an interconnect  therebetween. Preferably, the cuff modules  and  are similar to the circular cuff module  shown in  (and described in greater detail in the above incorporated \u201cSoft Circular Restraint Apparatus and Method\u201d patent application), except that the rigid loop  is not necessary.","However, the leg restraint system  may be utilized with a set of any other generally circular cuff modules (for example, any commercially available resilient cuff restraints) capable of connecting to an interconnect device. It should be noted that the cuff modules ,  are shown in a simplified view and may include additional elements (such as locking mechanisms) that are not shown because such additional elements are not relevant to the present invention.","The interconnect  includes a first releasable connector  at its first end for releasable connection to the cuff module  via a rigid loop  disposed on the outer surface of the cuff module , and a second releasable connector  at its second end for releasable connection to the cuff module  via a rigid loop  disposed on the outer surface of the cuff module . The releasable connectors ,  enable the interconnect  to be quickly disconnected from one or both cuff modules ,  in case of an emergency without removing the cuff modules ,  from the EDP's ankles. A third releasable connector  for attachment to an external restraint system (not shown) is attached to the interconnect  by a short strip . Other than the releasable connectors , , the leg restraint system  is substantially identical in construction and operation to the leg restraint system .","Referring now to , a third embodiment of the leg restraint system  of the present invention is shown as a leg restraint system . The leg restraint system  includes a first cuff module , a second cuff module , and an interconnect  therebetween. Preferably, the cuff modules  and  are similar to the circular cuff module  shown in  (and described in greater detail in the above incorporated \u201cSoft Circular Restraint Apparatus and Method\u201d patent application), except that the rigid loop  is not necessary.","However, the leg restraint system  may be utilized with a set of any other generally circular cuff modules (for example, any commercially available resilient cuff restraints) capable of connecting to an interconnect device. It should be noted that the cuff modules ,  are shown in a simplified view and may include additional elements (such as locking mechanisms) that are not shown because such additional elements are not relevant to the present invention.","The interconnect  has its first portion connected to a rigid loop  disposed on an outer surface of the cuff module , and its second portion connected to a rigid loop  disposed on an outer surface of the cuff module . Optionally, the interconnect  may be attached to the cuff modules ,  in another manner. The length of the interconnect  may be controlled by tensioning devices ,  disposed thereon by pulling on one or both of the respective first end  and second end  of the interconnect . Optionally, only one of the tensioning devices ,  may be provided. A releasable connector  for attachment to an external restraint system (not shown) is attached to the interconnect  by a short strip . Other than the tensioning devices ,  (and the interconnect  ends ,  pulled therethrough), the leg restraint system  is substantially identical in construction and operation to the leg restraint system .","Referring now to , the EDP is shown in a face down position on a floor surface secured by the arm restraint system  and the leg restraint system .","In conclusion, the above-described arm and leg restraint systems of the present invention are easy and intuitive to use and inexpensive to manufacture. Finally, the construction of the inventive arm and leg restraint systems makes them easy to deploy in confined areas.","Thus, while there have shown and described and pointed out fundamental novel features of the invention as applied to preferred embodiments thereof, it will be understood that various omissions and substitutions and changes in the form and details of the devices and methods illustrated, and in their operation, may be made by those skilled in the art without departing from the spirit of the invention. For example, it is expressly intended that all combinations of those elements and\/or method steps which perform substantially the same function in substantially the same way to achieve the same results are within the scope of the invention."],"BRFSUM":[{},{}],"brief-description-of-drawings":[{},{}],"description-of-drawings":{"heading":"BRIEF DESCRIPTION OF THE DRAWINGS","p":["In the drawings, wherein like reference characters denote corresponding or similar elements throughout the various figures:",{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0017","num":"0016"},"figref":"FIG. 1A"},{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0018","num":"0017"},"figref":["FIG. 1B","FIG. 1A"]},{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0019","num":"0018"},"figref":["FIG. 1C","FIG. 1A"]},{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0020","num":"0019"},"figref":["FIG. 1D","FIG. 1A"]},{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0021","num":"0020"},"figref":["FIG. 1E","FIG. 1A"]},{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0022","num":"0021"},"figref":["FIG. 1F","FIG. 1E"]},{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0023","num":"0022"},"figref":["FIG. 2A","FIG. 1D","FIG. 1A"]},{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0024","num":"0023"},"figref":["FIG. 2B","FIG. 2A"]},{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0025","num":"0024"},"figref":["FIG. 2C","FIG. 2A"]},{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0026","num":"0025"},"figref":["FIG. 3A","FIG. 1A"]},{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0027","num":"0026"},"figref":["FIG. 3B","FIG. 3A","FIG. 1A"]},{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0028","num":"0027"},"figref":"FIG. 4A"},{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0029","num":"0028"},"figref":["FIG. 4B","FIG. 4A"]},{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0030","num":"0029"},"figref":["FIG. 4C","FIG. 4A"]},{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0031","num":"0030"},"figref":"FIG. 4D"},{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0032","num":"0031"},"figref":"FIG. 4E"},{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0033","num":"0032"},"figref":["FIG. 5","FIG. 4A"],"b":"1"}]},"DETDESC":[{},{}]}
