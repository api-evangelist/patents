{"@attributes":{"id":"description"},"RELAPP":[{},{}],"p":["The present application claims priority to U.S. Provisional Application Ser. No. 61\/077,936, filed Jul. 3, 2008 and entitled \u201cREMOTE ITEM-PURCHASING SYSTEM,\u201d the content of which is hereby incorporated by reference in its entirety.","The present embodiments relate to purchasing of items. More particularly, the present embodiments relate to a mobile item-purchasing device and process.","In general, business arrangements between suppliers and retailers are set up such that the retailer places an order for items with the supplier and the supplier ships or otherwise transfers the items to the retailer, thereby satisfying the order. However, certain retailers, such as college bookstores, often purchase used books from students and then resell the used books. Here, the decision to sell the used books is typically made by the student independently of the bookstores. Also, the student has to approach the bookstore, or at least post a book for sale in an on-line book selling and purchasing marketplace, before the bookstore can make a decision to purchase the book. This results in missed selling and buying opportunities.","A mobile item-purchasing device and method is provided. The method includes entering identification information for a physical item for sale by a seller into a mobile item-purchasing device. The method also includes, in response to entering the identification information for the item for sale into the mobile item-purchasing device, electronically obtaining, via the mobile item-purchasing device, a purchase price for the item for sale. The electronically obtained purchase price is utilized as a guide price for purchasing the item for sale from the seller.","This summary is not intended to describe each disclosed embodiment or every implementation of the mobile item-purchasing system. Many other novel advantages, features, and relationships will become apparent as this description proceeds. The figures and the description that follow more particularly exemplify illustrative embodiments.","While the above-identified figure sets forth one embodiment of the mobile item-purchasing system, other embodiments are also contemplated, as noted in the disclosure. In all cases, this disclosure presents the mobile item-purchasing system by way of representation and not limitation. It should be understood that numerous other modifications and embodiments can be devised by those skilled in the art which fall within the scope and spirit of the principles of this disclosure.","Disclosed is a mobile item-purchasing device and method. The mobile item-purchasing device can easily be transported to a seller's location at which items for sale by the seller can be purchased with the help of the device.",{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0013","num":"0012"},"figref":["FIG. 1","FIG. 1"],"b":["100","102","104"]},"In summary, as can be seen in , a mobile item-purchasing device  with an attached barcode scanner , for example, for obtaining item identification information is provided. In the embodiment of , mobile item-purchasing device  is GPS-enabled (includes GPS feature ). In some embodiments, mobile device  includes a microprocessor , memory , input component(s) , output component(s) , and a communication interface  for communicating with remote computers or other mobile devices. In one embodiment, the afore-mentioned components are coupled for communication with one another over a suitable bus . For simplification, connections of bus  to input component(s)  and output component(s)  are not shown in .","Memory  is implemented as non-volatile electronic memory such as random access memory (RAM) with a battery back-up module (not shown) such that information stored in memory  is not lost when the general power to mobile device  is shut down. A portion of memory  is preferably allocated as addressable memory for program execution, while another portion of memory  is preferably used for storage, such as to simulate storage on a disk drive or any computer storage medium.","In one embodiment, memory  includes an operating system , application programs  as well as an object store . During operation, operating system  is preferably executed by processor  from memory . Operating system  is preferably designed for mobile devices, and implements database features that can be utilized by applications  through a set of exposed application programming interfaces and methods. The objects in object store  are maintained by applications  and operating system , at least partially in response to calls to the exposed application programming interfaces and methods.","Communication interface  represents numerous devices and technologies that allow mobile device  to send and receive information. The devices include wired and wireless modems, satellite receivers and broadcast tuners to name a few. Mobile device  can also be directly connected to a computer to exchange data therewith. In such cases, communication interface  can be an infrared transceiver or a serial or parallel communication connection, all of which are capable of transmitting streaming information. In some embodiments, mobile device  is also Internet-enabled.","Input and output components  and  include a variety of input devices such as a touch-sensitive screen, buttons, rollers, and a microphone as well as a variety of output devices including an audio generator, a vibrating device, and a display. The devices listed above are by way of example and need not all be present on mobile device . In addition, other input\/output devices may be attached to or found with mobile device  within the scope of the present invention.","The mobile device  is programmed in accordance with some of the present embodiments to, after receiving the item identification information, communicate (using wired or wireless communication) with one or multiple pricing information sources , , , etc., for example, to obtain a purchase price of the item. Typically, a price collater\/arbiter  is included between the mobile device and the pricing information sources. Price collater\/arbiter , which can comprise a server with software stored on a computer storage medium and executed by a processor, receives item identification information from the mobile device , obtains salability and pricing information for the item from the pricing information sources ,  and , computes a single purchase price for the item from the information obtained from the pricing information sources ,  and , and returns the single purchase price to the mobile device . Once the purchase price is obtained and the seller agrees to purchase the item, as noted above, the mobile item-purchasing device is used to issue a payment to the seller for the item. Typically, multiple mobile item-purchasing devices communicate with the multiple pricing information sources , , , etc. However, for simplification, only one mobile item-purchasing device is shown in . On a college campus, for example, every dormitory resident assistant (RA) (or fraternity president) could be armed with a mobile item-purchasing device\u2014allowing the retailer (college bookstore, for example) to deliver an extremely cost effective mobile buyback mechanism for used books directly to the student's doorstep\u2014extending the product acquisition arm out to meet the suppliers rather than requiring them to go to the retailer. Historical information related to the purchase of each item using the mobile item-purchasing device is maintained. In general, the historical information is utilized to help in future item acquisition and product\/item marketing.","Currently, as noted earlier, college bookstores (or bookstores, in general) that buy (or buy back) used books rely on the students to bring the used books to the bookstore and receive payments for the used books at the bookstore. One general concept of the present embodiments is to eliminate the need for the students to bring the used books to the bookstore and instead use affiliates of the bookstore to go to the students, ask them if they have any books for sale, provide them with buy back prices for any books that they may want to sell, and pay them for any books that they decide to sell. As described above, the purchase price determination and payment process is carried out with the help of a mobile item-purchasing device such as device . In some embodiments, mobile device  is configured to communicate with an inventory control system of the buyer (e.g., the bookstore). The inventory control system can be a pricing information source, can provide a buying list to device  and can also be updated from device  substantially in real-time with purchasing information each time a book on the buying list is purchased, for example. Thus, any of pricing information sources ,  and  can be an inventory control system in which suitable software is stored on a computer storage medium and executed by a processor. Also, when the pricing information source is an inventory control system, instead of providing pricing information to mobile device  in real-time each time a price request is submitted from the mobile device , pricing information for an entire buying list can be periodically provided by the inventory control system to the mobile device . This pricing information can be stored in memory  of mobile device  and thus be available locally on the device. In a specific embodiment, mobile device  communicates with the inventory control system of the bookstore every time a book is purchased in the field. The communication involves providing information such as the title of the book and\/or other identification information for the book, and possibly identification information for the mobile device and\/or the affiliate, to the inventory control system. The communication is usually sent to the inventory control system of the nearest retail location (referred to herein as a \u201chome store\u201d) of the bookstore. The affiliate either takes the purchased books to the home store or ships the purchased books to the home store. Since the inventory system of the home store is electronically updated in advance with identification for the purchased books, receiving the purchased books at the home store involves reconciling the physical purchased books brought, or shipped, by the affiliate, with the stored purchasing information. The reconciliation can be carried out by scanning identification information for the physical purchased books at the home store. It should be noted that the reconciliation is built into the inventory control system and not into the mobile device. In some embodiments, the inventory control system notifies the mobile device that \u201cit is time to reconcile\u201d based on predetermined conditions, such as the elapsing of a predetermined time period since the last reconciliation was carried out, or any other suitable condition or conditions. The affiliate receives a commission on the books received and is charged for any books that are delinquent.",{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0021","num":"0020"},"figref":["FIG. 3","FIG. 2","FIG. 2","FIG. 2","FIG. 2"],"b":["201","200","300","302","304","306","308","200","203"]},"As noted above, different methods of issuing payments for purchased items can be carried out using the mobile item-purchasing device. Details of some example methods of issuing payments are as follows:","1) Pre-Paid Debit Card",{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0023","num":"0022"},"figref":["FIG. 4","FIG. 4","FIG. 2","FIG. 4"],"b":["203","400","402","404","406","404","400","200","401","403","405"]},"Once a transaction is ready to be completed and payment is to be issued, the buyer's agent\/affiliate selects a non-activated card to be activated from his\/her stack of non-activated pre-paid debit cards, scans (using the barcode scanner on the mobile item-purchasing device) the secure ISO barcode (bar-coded transaction account number)  on the card  and inputs a cellular phone number, for example, of the seller into the mobile item-purchasing device  to complete payment. Once this data is entered into the mobile item-purchasing device  and submitted from the mobile item-purchasing device  to payment processing component , component  sends a request, containing the transaction account number, to card management system  to retrieve the card number. In response to the request for card number information, card management system  returns the card number to component . The card number is then used by payment processing component  in subsequent requests to perform other card-related functions. Specifically, using the card number retrieved from component  in the previous request, a request, which includes the seller's cell phone number, is sent by component  to component  to update information on the card account. Another request is submitted from component  to component  to change the cardholder's PIN to be the last 4 digits, for example, of the seller's cell phone number. A request is then sent from component  to component  to activate the card. This is followed by a request with the amount of money to load on the card. After the final request is processed, the system sends a SMS message to the seller's phone  indicating funds have been added to the seller's card.","2) Paper Check-Based Technique","In this technique, a payment is completed by sending a paper check to the seller's choice of address. Thus, the seller's address information has to be input into the mobile item-purchasing device. An option to also deliver an instant text\/email based payment receipt (with payment claim number and information to access transaction history via a web site, for example) is also included.\n\n3) PayPal\/Amazon Text Mobile Payments (with Text Message Based Confirmation)\n\nHere, the seller provides (and confirms) a cell phone number to be paid and payment is substantially immediately issued to the specified device via text message.\n\n4) Cash Transaction Technique\n\nA cash transaction override is also provided for situations where reimbursement needs to take place quickly and efficiently with no seller input.\n","In general, any of the above payment methods can be used by the bookstore to pay the affiliate commission for purchased books. For example, the same type of debit cards that the affiliate uses to pay the students for purchased books can also be used by the affiliate for self-payment of commission on reconciled books. For example, once the affiliate has built up a $50 commission, the affiliate can load that commission onto one of the debit cards using the scanning process described above.","Although the specific embodiments described above include examples of the mobile item-purchasing device being utilized to purchase books, the mobile item-purchasing device (and the central system driving it (for example, datacenter )) has the ability to evaluate salability, risk and calculate a purchase price, for example, on any video game, CD, or DVD with a valid International Standard Book Number (ISBN) or Universal Product Code (UPC). A search by title, which is especially useful for items that do not include an ISBN or UPC, is also an option in some embodiments. Information on the pricing and salability mechanism for video game, CD, or DVD items varies slightly from textbooks in some embodiments. These variations are outlined in a specific example of a salability evaluation and purchase price calculation process (carried out, for example, within collater\/arbiter ), which is as follows:","1) In the examples provided earlier, the arbiter\/collater  is shown communicatively coupled to a single mobile item-purchasing device. However, as indicated earlier, collater\/arbiter  is capable of communicating with a number of mobile item-purchasing devices at different locations. Thus, on each purchase price request, each mobile item-purchasing device identifies itself to collater\/arbiter  by communicating its unique identification number such as its phone number (or logged in user in the event a phone number is not available). In general, collater\/arbiter  interacts separately with each mobile item-purchasing device, thereby allowing for a process which can be modified remotely between scans\/requests on a device-by-device basis, giving the ability to orchestrate purchase prices across a country, for example, in a real-time fashion (even based on real-time marketplace sales or buying at other areas of the country, which are remote from any particular mobile item purchasing device being used). In addition, some embodiments provide the capability to disable the ability to purchase by product type, allowing only certain devices to, for example, purchase video games.","In general, an item being scanned is evaluated across multiple price sources prior to a purchase price being determined. If the item is a book, in a specific embodiment, it may be evaluated against the following price sources, in the following order of operation:","1) Identified local bookstore buying list,","2) Aggregated buying list from multiple bookstores across the country,","3) A Wholesale Buyers Guide, and","4) Real-time online marketplace price and salability data.","It should be noted that online salability data could be used at all tiers of price evaluation to help determine risk.","In some embodiments, collater\/arbiter  includes sufficient built-in intelligence to partition purchases to the correct bookstores in the event an aggregated buying list is used.","Typically, a number of variables are important in determining re-salability and price of an item being evaluated. The following is an example list of configuration items evaluated, by price collater\/arbiter , on each scan (or ultimately each item if the mobile item-purchasing device is in multi-scan mode):","a. Phone number or login credentials of requesting phone,","b. Maximum per title purchase quantity (globally affects all items),","c. ISBN\/UPC Override List (allows for completely blocking or setting a static purchase price or purchase quantity on any title),","d. Maximum Sales Rank Threshold, based on product category, is a number, obtained from Amazon's Sales Ranking System, that exhibits how any particular book is selling. The lower the number reflected in the Sales","Ranking System for a particular type of item, the higher the sales for that type of item. The calculation is based on sales and is updated each hour to reflect recent and historical sales of every item sold (e.g., a maximum sales rank threshold (i.e., no purchase authorized) may be set at: 300,000 for Textbooks; 2,200 for Video Games and DVDs),","e. Resale Risk Buffer (RRB) Matrix, customizable by a profile making the request, is a formula that utilizes the Maximum Sales Rank Threshold for controlling resale risk. The following is an example that discounts the item purchase price in proportion with the Maximum Sales Rank Threshold.",{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0043","num":"0042"},"tables":{"@attributes":{"id":"TABLE-US-00001","num":"00001"},"table":{"@attributes":{"frame":"none","colsep":"0","rowsep":"0"},"tgroup":{"@attributes":{"align":"left","colsep":"0","rowsep":"0","cols":"3"},"colspec":[{"@attributes":{"colname":"offset","colwidth":"14pt","align":"left"}},{"@attributes":{"colname":"1","colwidth":"112pt","align":"center"}},{"@attributes":{"colname":"2","colwidth":"91pt","align":"center"}}],"thead":{"row":[{"entry":[{},{"@attributes":{"namest":"offset","nameend":"2","align":"center","rowsep":"1"}}]},{"entry":[{},"% of Maximum Sales Rank Threshold","% Purchase price Reduction"]},{"entry":[{},{"@attributes":{"namest":"offset","nameend":"2","align":"center","rowsep":"1"}}]}]},"tbody":{"@attributes":{"valign":"top"},"row":[{"entry":[{},"<=100","\u2009\u2009\u200920%"]},{"entry":[{},"\u2002<=80","\u2009\u2009\u200915%"]},{"entry":[{},"\u2002<=60","\u2009\u2009\u200910%"]},{"entry":[{},"\u2002<=40","\u2002\u2009\u2009\u20095%"]},{"entry":[{},"\u2002<=20","\u2002\u2009\u2009\u20090%"]},{"entry":[{},"\u2002<=10","\u22122.5%"]},{"entry":[{},"\u2003<=5","\u22122.5%"]},{"entry":[{},{"@attributes":{"namest":"offset","nameend":"2","align":"center","rowsep":"1"}}]}]}}}}},"f.

One example of calculating the base purchase price is as follows:\n\n","As noted earlier, in some embodiments, the mobile item-purchasing device is GPS-enabled and therefore its location can be tracked. The GPS feature can be used for certain specific purposes, which include the following:","1) Inhibiting Item-Purchasing Functions within a Predetermined Zone","To protect a college bookstore's existing walk-in business, for example, mobile item-purchasing devices used by affiliates of the college bookstore can be configured such that their item-purchasing functions are inhibited when the device is within a predetermined radius from the college bookstore. In general, this feature can be used for a number of reasons such as preventing item-purchasing transactions from occurring in certain areas of a city or college campus, for example.\n\n2) Hot Spot Buying\n\nIn general, a mobile item-purchasing device can be configured to automatically send a message to at least one other mobile item-purchasing device based on one or more predetermined conditions. One such condition can be \u201chot spot buying,\u201d which, in general, is purchasing activity at a rate higher than a predetermined threshold (for example, items purchased from ten different sellers in a 30-minute period) in a particular mobile item-purchasing device. Thus, in some embodiments, when a particular mobile item-purchasing device experiences purchasing activity beyond a predetermined threshold, it automatically sends messages to other mobile item-purchasing devices within a predetermined radius from the mobile item-purchasing device, for example, notifying the other devices of the location of the hot spot. In some embodiments, instead of waiting for the automatic message to be sent, a user of the mobile item-purchasing device can send a hot spot notification message (or purchasing assistance request) at the user's discretion such as, for example, by pressing a pre-programmed button on the mobile item-purchasing device. In general, the mobile item-purchasing device provides area-based messaging capabilities, which includes selecting a particular area and sending a message to all mobile item-purchasing devices in that area. Thus, a message can be sent from a particular mobile item-purchasing device indicating that a hot spot condition at a particular location no longer exists, for example. It should be noted that, in some embodiments, any mobile item-purchasing device is capable of displaying a map showing a location of a hot spot and is also capable of providing directions to the hot spot.\n","As described earlier, mobile device  is capable of communicating with an inventory control system of a bookstore to provide purchasing information substantially in real-time. In some embodiments, this communication feature can be used to protect from overbuying in a real-time fashion. For example, if a particular book is on a home store's buying list and if the buying list reflects that only one of that particular book is desired, the system is capable of limiting the number of purchases of that particular book to one. Specifically, if the mobile device  is currently being used to purchase the particular book and if a student enters the home store with another copy of the same book, which is scanned in the home store a few seconds after completion of the purchase with the mobile device, the purchase of the particular book would be prevented in the home store by, for example, reducing the buying price of the particular book to 0 in the inventory control system. In some embodiments, the buying price for a particular book is inversely proportional to the number of purchased copies of the particular book. In general, the demand for books is managed in real-time between the mobile device and the home store.","The embodiments described above indicate that the mobile device is associated with a single home store of a bookstore. However, in some embodiments, the mobile device is configured to purchase books for one or more locations of the bookstore other than the home store. In such embodiments, when books are purchased for a location other than the home store, reconciliation of books purchased for the other location(s) can be carried out at the home store. The reconciled purchased books are then transferred to the other location(s). In general, a mobile item device can be used to buy for a home store or any other information source with which it is capable of communicating.","Although the disclosed mobile item-purchasing system and associated method has been described with reference to preferred embodiments, workers skilled in the art will recognize that changes may be made in form and detail without departing from the spirit and scope of the disclosure. It should be noted that although most of the above embodiments describe the purchasing books for bookstores, the teachings of the above disclosure are applicable for any suitable item-purchasing system. In general, all software programs and data used in the above-described embodiments are stored on computer storage media. Processors execute the software and therefore help perform any calculations required by the software program code. Mobile device  may be a mobile telephone, a laptop a personal digital assistant (PDA) or any other suitable portable device."],"BRFSUM":[{},{}],"heading":["FIELD","BACKGROUND","SUMMARY","DETAILED DESCRIPTION OF ILLUSTRATIVE EMBODIMENTS"],"brief-description-of-drawings":[{},{}],"description-of-drawings":{"heading":"BRIEF DESCRIPTION OF THE DRAWINGS","p":[{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0007","num":"0006"},"figref":"FIG. 1"},{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0008","num":"0007"},"figref":"FIG. 2"},{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0009","num":"0008"},"figref":"FIG. 3"},{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0010","num":"0009"},"figref":"FIG. 4"}]},"DETDESC":[{},{}]}
