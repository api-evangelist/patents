{"@attributes":{"id":"description"},"RELAPP":[{},{}],"heading":["RELATED APPLICATIONS","BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION","SUMMARY OF THE INVENTION","DETAILED DESCRIPTION OF THE INVENTION","EMBODIMENTS OF THE INVENTION"],"p":["The present application claims the benefit of U.S. Provisional Patent Application No. 61\/106,142, filed Oct. 16, 2008, entitled \u201cNATIVE APPLICATION FOR A PORTABLE ELECTRONIC DEVICE ENABLING USER INTERACTION WITH ENTERPRISE APPLICATIONS,\u201d naming Dan Sharoni as the inventor. That application is incorporated herein by reference in its entirety and for all purposes.","Information related to a business, its customers, its competitors, and the like, is commonly referred to as \u201centerprise data\u201d and can be used by the business for a variety of purposes. For example, enterprise resource planning (ERP) utilizes enterprise data to implement business functions such as manufacturing, supply chain management, financials, projects, human resources and customer relationship management (CRM). Enterprise data may also be used for product lifecycle management (PLM) to help manufacturers with product-related information. As a further example, enterprise data may be used for supply chain management (SCM) and supplier relationship management (SRM) functions.","Conventional software packages for providing access to enterprise data generally require significant storage and processing resources, and thus, are generally run on desktop computer systems, server computer systems, or the like. The computer system running the conventional software package may generate a query for specific enterprise data and send the query to a system able to access the enterprise data. Once data is received from the system, it may be processed by the computer system running the conventional software package and presented to the user of the computer system.","Although enterprise data may be accessed using conventional software packages, the ability to access the enterprise data from remote locations or on the go is limited since the computer systems able to run the conventional software packages cannot be easily transported. Additionally, conventional software packages generally cannot be run on portable electronic devices such as smartphones or personal digital assistants (PDAs). Further, conventional portable electronic devices typically lack the storage and processing resources to adequately store and process the enterprise data. Thus, access to enterprise data is limited using conventional solutions.","Some portable devices allow limited access to resident enterprise applications that run on the portable device. However, these portable devices limit communication between multiple enterprise applications. Unfortunately, enterprise solutions often require multiple enterprise applications to talk to one another to obtain information, etc. As such, portable devices that restrict or prevent communication between enterprise applications offer a poor platform choice for enterprise applications.","Accordingly, a need exists for increased access to enterprise data on portable computer systems. More specifically, a need exists to access enterprise data from remote locations and while on the move. A need also exists for a portable electronic device capable of providing access to enterprise data and enabling a user to interact with enterprise applications capable of processing the enterprise data. Additionally, a need exists for enabling multiple enterprise applications, accessed by a portable electronic device which restricts data sharing between multiple resident or native applications, to share data. Embodiments of the present invention provide novel solutions to these needs and others as described below.","Embodiments of the present invention are directed to a method, system and graphical user interface for enabling a user to access enterprise data and interact with enterprise applications generating the enterprise data using a portable electronic device. More specifically, a native application for a portable electronic device enables a user of the portable electronic device to initiate or interact with one or more enterprise applications. The enterprise applications may be executed simultaneously and exchange data with one another. Each of the enterprise applications is executed remotely on a system in communication with the portable electronic device, where the portable electronic device may communicate data to the remote system and display data received from the remote system. For example, user inputs related to the enterprise applications may be communicated to the remote system from the portable electronic device, while enterprise web content associated with execution of the enterprise application may be communicated to the portable electronic device for display thereon. In this manner, embodiments utilize processing resources and storage resources of the remote system to execute the enterprise application, thereby enabling a user to initiate or interact with a computationally-intensive enterprise application using a portable electronic device.","Additionally, embodiments of the present invention offer a mechanism for enabling multiple enterprise applications, accessed by a portable electronic device which restricts data sharing between multiple native applications, to share data. The enterprise applications may be executed on a remote system, and therefore, not be subject to the data sharing restrictions associated with multiple native applications of the portable electronic device. Additionally, the data accessed by and\/or shared between the multiple enterprise applications may be stored on a memory of the portable electronic device, a memory of the remote system executing the enterprise applications, on a memory of another system (e.g., communicatively coupled to the portable electronic device and\/or the remote system executing the enterprise applications), etc.","In one embodiment, a method of interfacing with a user includes executing a native application on a portable computer system, wherein the portable computer system comprises a display screen and a user input device. The method also includes, using the native application, displaying of plurality of applications for selection by a user. In response to a user selection of a first of the plurality of applications, the portable computer system causes the first application to be executed on a remote computer system, wherein execution of the first application generates first enterprise content at the remote computer system. The native application receives the first enterprise content and parses the first enterprise content for display thereof. The method also includes the native application rendering a representation of the first enterprise content on the display screen. The native application may also provide content to the enterprise applications.","In another embodiment, a system includes a first component operable to execute a plurality of enterprise applications. A portable electronic device is communicatively coupled to the first component and disposed remotely from the first component, wherein the portable electronic device is operable to execute a plurality of native applications, wherein the plurality of native applications comprises a native enterprise application operable to initiate execution of at least one enterprise application of the plurality of enterprise applications on the first component. The enterprise applications may share data with one another, where the shared data may be stored in a memory of the portable electronic device, a memory of the system, etc. The system also includes a second component communicatively coupled between the first component and the portable electronic device, wherein the second component is operable to transform enterprise content from the at least one enterprise application into enterprise web content for rendering on the portable electronic device. The portable electronic device is further operable to display the enterprise web content for enabling user interaction with the at least one enterprise application executed by the first component.","In yet another embodiment, a graphical user interface for a portable electronic device includes a first region for displaying a first plurality of user interface elements associated with a native enterprise application executed by the portable electronic device, wherein each of the first plurality of user interface elements is associated with a respective enterprise application (e.g., executed on a system disposed remotely from the portable electronic device), wherein selection of a first user interface element of the first plurality of user interface elements is operable to cause a remote computer system to execute a first enterprise application associated with the first user interface element, and wherein the first region is further operable to display enterprise content generated by the remote computer system executing the first enterprise application. The graphical user interface also includes a second region for displaying a second plurality of user interface elements (e.g., a \u201chome\u201d button or recalling a home screen, a \u201cback\u201d button for recalling previously-displayed data or content, etc.) associated with the native enterprise application and at least one other native application for execution by the portable electronic device, wherein a user interaction with a second user interface element of the second plurality of user interface elements is operable to adjust a display of the enterprise web content in the first region.","The graphical user interface may provide uniform presentation of the results of the enterprise application execution. For example, the graphical user interface may display the data associated with the execution of the enterprise applications (e.g., enterprise data, enterprise content, enterprise web content, etc.) with a similar \u201clook and feel\u201d (e.g., with similar buttons, text, icons, etc.) as other native applications executed by the portable electronic device.","The graphical user interface may allow selection of multiple enterprise applications by displaying a plurality of enterprise applications in a selection screen. The selection screen may be reader-based, e.g., the selection screen may be generated using data from a remote system (e.g., executing the enterprise applications and disposed remotely from the portable electronic device) which is parsed and displayed by the native enterprise application executing on the portable electronic device.","Reference will now be made in detail to embodiments of the present invention, examples of which are illustrated in the accompanying drawings. While the present invention will be discussed in conjunction with the following embodiments, it will be understood that they are not intended to limit the present invention to these embodiments alone. On the contrary, the present invention is intended to cover alternatives, modifications, and equivalents which may be included with the spirit and scope of the present invention as defined by the appended claims.

More specifically, a native application (e.g., native enterprise application  of ) for a portable electronic device (e.g.,  of ) enables a user of the portable electronic device to interact with one or more enterprise applications (e.g., enterprise applications - of ). Each of the enterprise applications is executed remotely on a system (e.g., ) in communication with the portable electronic device, where the portable electronic device may communicate data to the remote system (e.g., via interface ) and display data received from the remote system (e.g., via interface ). For example, user inputs (e.g., input using user interface component  of ) related to the enterprise applications may be communicated to the remote system from the portable electronic device, while enterprise web content associated with initiation or execution of the enterprise application may be communicated to the portable electronic device for display thereon (e.g., using display device  of ). In this manner, embodiments utilize processing resources and storage resources of the remote system (e.g., ) to execute the enterprise application (e.g., , , , etc.), thereby enabling a user to initiate or interact with a computationally-intensive enterprise application (e.g., , , , etc.) using a portable electronic device (e.g., ).","The native enterprise application (e.g., ) may generate a graphical user interface (e.g., as shown in ) for enabling a user to initiate remote execution of an enterprise application and\/or interact with one or more enterprise applications being executed on a remote system. For example, enterprise web content associated with a list of enterprise applications for execution may be communicated to the portable electronic device from the remote system. The enterprise web content may be rendered by the portable electronic device (e.g., using a web browser engine of the portable electronic device) to display a list of enterprise applications for selection by a user. The graphical user interface displaying the enterprise applications may have a \u201clook and feel\u201d similar to that of other native applications executable by the portable electronic device. In response to a user selecting an enterprise application from the list of enterprise applications displayed on the portable electronic device, data may be sent from the portable electronic device to a remote system for initiating execution of the enterprise application on the remote system.","During execution of the one or more enterprise applications (e.g., , , , etc.) on the remote system (e.g., ), enterprise data may be accessed from a component of an enterprise backend (e.g., enterprise information database , legacy system , database server , email server , etc.). The enterprise applications (e.g., , , , etc.) may share data with one another, where the shared data may be stored on a memory of the portable electronic device (e.g., ), a memory of the remote system (e.g., ), on a memory of another system (e.g., communicatively coupled to the device  and\/or the system ), etc. The remote system (e.g., ) may process the enterprise data and generate enterprise content (e.g., output from the enterprise applications). The enterprise content may be transformed (e.g., by transformation component ) into enterprise web content (e.g., having a format such as XML, java, CSS, http, https, etc.) for rendering by and\/or display on a portable electronic device (e.g., using a web browser engine of the portable electronic device). In this manner, user inputs to the portable electronic device (e.g., ) from a user viewing the displayed enterprise web content may be communicated to the remote system (e.g., ) for enabling a user to interact with the one or more enterprise applications executed by the remote system (e.g., ).",{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0032","num":"0031"},"figref":["FIG. 1","FIG. 1"],"b":["100","110","120","115","120","130","125","110","120","121","122","123","120","120","120","110","110","120","120","110","120","120","110"]},"As shown in , enterprise backend  may provide access to a variety of enterprise data. Enterprise data may be any information related to a business. For example, enterprise information database  may store public information about a business (e.g., name, location, name of officers, information about competitors of a given business, etc.) and\/or private information about a business (e.g., information about internal operations of the business, information collected from employees or contractors of the business, information related to client interactions, information related to interaction with suppliers or other business partners, etc.). In one embodiment, database  may be a SAP database, Oracle database, ERP database, CRM database, PLM database, SCM database, SRM database, or another database storing enterprise data. Enterprise backend  may also provide access to enterprise systems (e.g., legacy system , database server , email server ) which may in turn provide access to other enterprise data. As such, a user of device  may access a variety of enterprise data.","System  may execute one or more of enterprise applications - using enterprise application processing component , where the one or more enterprise applications may be executed sequentially and\/or contemporaneously. The one or more enterprise applications being executed on system  may access and\/or process enterprise data (e.g., communicated from enterprise backend ). For example, raw enterprise data (e.g., in the form of numbers, words, etc.) may be accessed and processed using one or more enterprise applications to generate enterprise content (e.g., processed enterprise data including charts, graphs or other information derived from the raw enterprise data).","The enterprise content (e.g., output from one or more of enterprise applications -) may be used to generate enterprise web content using enterprise data transformation component . For example, enterprise content may be accessed in a first format directly from processing component , from memory , etc. Enterprise web content may be generated by component  based upon the enterprise data, where the enterprise web content is in a second format for rendering by and\/or display on device . For example, the enterprise web content may be associated with a format such as XML, java, CSS, http, https, or another format which may be accessed and\/or parsed by device .","System  also includes intra-enterprise application integration component  for enabling a plurality of enterprise applications to share data or otherwise function together. For example, a first enterprise application (e.g., ) may access enterprise data (e.g., raw enterprise data accessed from backend ) and\/or enterprise content generated or accessed by a second enterprise application (e.g., ) using component . The enterprise content or enterprise data may be accessed from a memory of system  (e.g., memory ), a memory of device  (e.g., memory  of ), or another memory accessible by one or more components of system . In this manner, component  may coordinate operation of a plurality of enterprise applications (e.g., , , , etc.) to enable a user of device  to access additional, richer, more complex or otherwise different enterprise data. Additionally, it should be appreciated that the data sharing between multiple enterprise applications may be implemented even where the device  may restrict and\/or prohibit data sharing between native applications executed on the portable electronic device, and thus, a user of device  may initiate and\/or interact with one or more enterprise applications which share data with one another.","Memory  may be used to store enterprise data, enterprise content, enterprise web content, or some combination thereof. For example, enterprise data may be stored in memory  and accessed in portions for processing by processing component . Memory  may store enterprise content for access and processing by component . As a further example, the enterprise content and\/or enterprise web content may be formatted or partitioned to fit the display screen of portable electronic device , and thus, memory  may store portions of the enterprise content or enterprise web content to be subsequently communicated to device  for display thereon (e.g., in response to a user scrolling through information presented on device , in response to another user input to device , etc.).","System  may be implemented by a web server in one embodiment. Alternatively, system  may be an ERP server, CRM server, etc. And in other embodiments, system  may be another type of computer system and\/or server.","As shown in , interface  and\/or interface  may be a wired interface and\/or a wireless interface. For example, data may be communicated over interface  and\/or interface  in accordance with a wireless standard such as WiMAX, WLAN, WPAN, WMAN, etc. Interface  and\/or interface  may comprise a GSM network, GPRS network, UMTS network, or the like. And in one embodiment, interface  and\/or interface  may comprise a wired network such as a local area network (LAN), wide-area network (WAN), etc.","In one embodiment, interface  and\/or interface  may include at least one insecure portion or reduced-security portion. For example, interface  and\/or interface  may include the Internet, one or more demilitarized zones (DMZs), one or more proxy servers, etc. Accordingly, one or more trusted connections may be established between components of system  (e.g., device , system , enterprise backend , etc.) to more securely transfer data (e.g., enterprise data, enterprise content, enterprise web content, etc.). In one embodiment, a trusted connection between device  and system  (e.g., utilizing interface ) may be established in accordance with security policies stored in device management database  of system , where the security policies are specific to device , a group of devices including device , etc. The security policies may be established by an enterprise information technology (IT) department and\/or chief information officer (CIO) in one embodiment.","In another embodiment, a virtual private network (VPN) may be created for more securely transferring data between device  and system  using public networks, where the VPN is established using a portion of the native enterprise application running on device . The native enterprise application may also implement authentication procedures (e.g., to authenticate device  and\/or system  before communicating sensitive data) and\/or encryption procedures (e.g., encryption, decryption, etc.) with system  to further increase the security of data communicated between device  and system . Further, in one embodiment, the native enterprise application running on device  may utilize soft tokens or other security mechanisms to increase the security of data communicated between device  and system .","As shown in , system  also includes provisioning database . Database  may store information used to determine which enterprise applications (e.g., , , , etc.) a user of device  may initiate and\/or interact with. For example, information stored in database  may be used to determine that a user of device  may initiate and\/or interact with enterprise applications  and  (e.g., and not enterprise application ), while information stored in database  may be used to determine that a user of another portable electronic device (e.g., communicatively coupled to system ) may initiate and\/or interact with enterprise applications  and  (e.g., and not enterprise application ). In this manner, embodiments enable a privilege level to be assigned to one device (e.g., ), thereby creating a one-to-one relationship between a user and the device (e.g., ) to enable only that user to authenticate and access enterprise data using the device (e.g., ). Alternatively, embodiments enable a privilege level to be assigned to a group of devices (e.g., including device  and other devices).","In one embodiment, the privilege level assigned to device  may be determined during an authentication procedure implemented by the native enterprise application running on device . For example, a user may input login information (e.g., username, password, etc.), where the login information may be used to determine information about the user used to determine the privilege level assigned to device . For example, if it is determined that the user is an owner of a business as opposed to a lower-level employee of the business, device  may enable the user to interact with a larger number of enterprise applications. In one embodiment, the listing of enterprise applications displayed on device  for selection by the owner may be more extensive than a similar listing of enterprise applications displayed on another portable electronic device of the lower-level employee, thereby enabling a user to initiate and\/or interact with only those enterprise applications associated with the privilege level of the device. Additionally, the privilege level assigned to device  may be stored in provisioning database  of system , a memory of device  (e.g., memory  of ), etc. Further, the login information and\/or information about a user may be communicated over the Internet (e.g., as part of interface ), and therefore, the authentication procedure may be web-based in one embodiment.","Provisioning database  may also be used to implement one or more security measures to protect data on device  and\/or to protect data accessed by device  using the native enterprise application (e.g.,  of ). For example, if it is determined that device  is lost, stolen, or otherwise in the hands of an unauthorized user, the data in provisioning database  may be updated to adjust the privilege level of the device such that device  has reduced or no access to enterprise data or other data from system . In this manner, memory (e.g., ) or other components of the device  may be remotely locked or deleted (e.g., wiped) to make data (e.g., enterprise data) stored on device  inaccessible to an unauthorized user of the device (e.g., ). And in one embodiment, if it is determined that device  is lost, stolen, or otherwise in the hands of an unauthorized user, the native enterprise application (e.g.,  of ) or other components of device  may cause data stored on device  (e.g., associated with enterprise data or other data from system ) to be deleted (e.g., wiped) or otherwise rendered inaccessible (e.g., locked) in response to commands from system . It should be appreciated that the data (e.g., enterprise data) may be made inaccessible (e.g., by deleting, wiping, locking, etc.) to an unauthorized user of the device (e.g., ) without affecting the execution of other applications (e.g., native applications , , , etc.) on the device (e.g., ) in one embodiment.","As shown in , device application server  is coupled to device . Device application server  stores applications (e.g., native applications) for download and execution by device . In one embodiment, the native enterprise application run on device  (e.g., for enabling device  to provide access to enterprise data and\/or enable user interaction with one or more enterprise applications) may be downloaded from server  via interface .","System  may also include computer system  coupled to device  via interface . Computer system  may be a personal computer system of the user of device , where system  is used to communicate data with device . For example, a user may synchronize data on device  with data stored on or accessed by system .","In one embodiment, interface  and\/or  may be a wired interface and\/or a wireless interface.

In one embodiment, data may be communicated over interface  and\/or interface  in accordance with a wired standard such as USB 1.1, USB 2.0, Firewire, PCI-Express, SATA, etc. And in one embodiment, interface  and\/or interface  may comprise a wired network such as a local area network (LAN), wide-area network (WAN), etc.","Although  shows system  with a specific number and arrangement of components (e.g., , , ,  and ), it should be appreciated that system  may include a different number and\/or arrangement of components in other embodiments. For example, it should be appreciated that a plurality of portable electronic devices (e.g., similar to and\/or including device ) may be communicatively coupled to system  in other embodiments. Additionally, although  shows each component of system  with a specific number and arrangement of sub-components (e.g., - of enterprise backend , - of system , etc.), it should be appreciated that one or more of the components of system  may include a different number or arrangement of sub-components in other embodiments.",{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0049","num":"0048"},"figref":"FIG. 2","b":["110","110","110"]},"As shown in , device  includes a plurality of native applications  which are stored locally in a memory of device  (e.g., memory ) and executed by a processor (e.g., ) of device .
