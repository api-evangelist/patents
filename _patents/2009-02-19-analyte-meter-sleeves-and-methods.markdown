{"@attributes":{"id":"description"},"RELAPP":[{},{}],"heading":["RELATED APPLICATIONS","FIELD OF THE INVENTION","BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION","SUMMARY OF THE INVENTION","DETAILED DESCRIPTION"],"p":["The present application claims priority to U.S. Provisional Patent Application No. 61\/090,502, filed Aug. 20, 2008, and entitled \u201cBLOOD GLUCOSE METER SLEEVES\u201d, which is hereby incorporated herein by reference in its entirety for all purposes.","The present invention relates to analyte monitoring and\/or control, and more particularly to sleeves for analyte meters used in analyte monitoring and\/or control.","The monitoring of analyte concentration levels in a bio-fluid (e.g., blood) may be an important part of health diagnostics. For example, analyte meters and accompanying sensors (sometimes referred to as \u201ctest strips\u201d) may be employed for the monitoring of a patient's blood glucose level as part of diabetes treatment and care. In blood glucose monitoring, for example, the patient may carry and use an analyte meter (e.g., a blood glucose meter) for providing a digital readout of a user's blood glucose level, and a portable lancet device for attaining a blood sample. The meter may be an Ascensia\u00ae BREEZE\u00ae 2 Blood Glucose Meter available from Bayer Healthcare, for example.","The lancet device may be a spring-loaded, trigger-releasable device which receives a single use, disposable lancet. For example, the lancet device may be an Ascensia\u00ae MICROLET\u00ae Lancet Device available from Bayer Healthcare. In use, the user may release the lancet device such that it may prick the user's body part (e.g., finger) to produce the droplet of blood. That blood droplet may then be transferred to a test strip which interfaces with, and may be received within a port in, the blood glucose meter.","Given that the users of such analyte meters and lancet devices need to carry such devices with them for blood analyte monitoring, there is a need for improved methods and apparatus for storing and carrying such devices.","In a first aspect, the present invention provides a blood glucose meter sleeve including a first sleeve member including a front panel and a back panel forming a first pocket adapted to receive an analyte meter, the front panel having a window allowing viewing and access to a meter display and one or more meter buttons, and an opening in a rear of the first pocket adapted to allow access to a port formed in the analyte meter; and a second sleeve member forming a second pocket proximate to the back panel, the second pocket adapted to receive a lancet device.","In another aspect, the present invention provides an analyte meter sleeve including a first sleeve member forming a pocket adapted to receive an analyte meter, the first sleeve member having a window adapted to allow viewing of a meter display of the analyte meter; and a second member affixed to the first sleeve member forming a retainer adapted to secure a lancet device to the first sleeve member.","In another aspect, the present invention provides a method of using an analyte meter sleeve including mounting an analyte meter in a first sleeve member; and mounting a lancet device in a second member affixed to the first sleeve member.","Other features and aspects of the present invention will become more fully apparent from the following detailed description, the appended claims and the accompanying drawings.","Because the user may desire to carry an analyte meter (e.g., a blood glucose meter) and the associated lancet device on their person at all times, and such devices may be easily misplaced from each other or lost, it may be desirable to provide an apparatus that would provide for carrying such devices and which may allow for ready access to the analyte meter and lancet device. In this manner, the processes of sample collection and analyte testing (e.g., blood glucose testing) may be readily performed and instances of misplacement of the devices may be reduced or eliminated.","Accordingly, in a first aspect of the present invention an analyte meter sleeve (e.g., a blood glucose meter sleeve) is provided. In one or more embodiments, the analyte meter sleeve may include a first sleeve member forming a pocket which is adapted to receive an analyte meter (e.g., a blood glucose meter), and a second member affixed to the first meter sleeve which is adapted to receive and secure a lancet device. The analyte meter sleeve is adapted for use with any type of analyte meter used for testing and\/or control of an analyte, such as meters for testing glucose, hemoglobin A1c, lipids such as LDL, HDL and triglycerides, lactate, keytone, and other analytes. The term \u201canalyte meter,\u201d as used herein, includes a blood analyte meter, an insulin pump, a controller for an insulin delivery system, a patch pump, a glucose meter, or other like metering devices.","The first sleeve member may include a window allowing viewing and access to a meter display of the analyte meter and one or more meter buttons thereof. Additionally, another opening may be provided in the first sleeve, such as in a rear of the pocket of the first sleeve member, which may be adapted to allow access to a sensor port formed which may be in the analyte meter. The sensor port is adapted to receive an analyte sensor (e.g., a sensor strip).","These and other embodiments of the analyte meter sleeve of the present invention are described below with reference to .",{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0022","num":"0021"},"figref":["FIGS. 1-2","FIG. 1","FIG. 2"],"b":["100","100","100","102","104","106","104","106","108","110","111","104","106","108","110","102"]},"In some embodiments, the front panel  may have a window  which may allow viewing of a display  and may also allow access to one or more meter buttons .
