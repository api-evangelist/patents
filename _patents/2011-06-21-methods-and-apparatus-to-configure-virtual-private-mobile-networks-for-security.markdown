{"@attributes":{"id":"description"},"BRFSUM":[{},{}],"heading":["FIELD OF THE DISCLOSURE","BACKGROUND","DETAILED DESCRIPTION"],"p":["This disclosure relates generally to mobile networks and, more particularly, to methods and apparatus to configure virtual private mobile networks for security.","Virtualization of computing and networking platforms is becoming popular with clients and customers by providing flexible, on demand resources at a relatively low cost. A virtualized computing network, also known as a cloud computing network, enables clients to manage web-based applications and\/or data resources by dynamically leasing computational resources and associated network resources from service providers. These web-based applications, data resources, and\/or routing resources may be used by customers of the clients, individuals associated with the clients, and\/or by the clients. This dynamic leasing of computational and network resources creates an appearance and function of a distributive computing network and, thus, is referred to as virtualization of a network. Virtualized platforms utilize partitioning and allocation of network and\/or computing resources. Accordingly, new resources provisioned for a client may be added quickly as needed within short periods of time by a network provider allocating an additional portion of shared resources to the client. Additionally, virtualization in a network enables network providers to dynamically multiplex resources among multiple clients without dedicating individual physical resources to each client.","Example methods, articles of manufacture, and apparatus to configure virtual private mobile networks for security are disclosed. A disclosed example method includes identifying, in a wireless network, a communication from a user equipment that matches a security event profile. The example method also includes transmitting, from the wireless network, an instruction to enable the user equipment to be communicatively coupled to a virtual private mobile network, the virtual private mobile network being provisioned for security within the wireless network. The example method further includes enabling the user equipment to transmit a second communication through the virtual private mobile network securely isolated from other portions of the wireless network.","A disclosed example apparatus includes a security processor to identify, in a wireless network, communications from a user equipment that are a potential threat to the wireless network, the communications matching a security event profile. The example security processor also is to provision logically within the wireless network a virtual private mobile network to process the communications associated with the potential threat. The example apparatus further includes a device migrator to communicatively couple the user equipment to the virtual private mobile network.","Currently, wireless mobile networks enable subscribing customers to connect to an external packet switched network (e.g., the Internet) via mobile devices. These wireless mobile networks provide wireless network service via dedicated hardware (e.g., network elements also known as mobility network elements). In many instances, network elements are configured for a corresponding wireless communication protocol. Throughout the following disclosure, reference is made to network elements associated with the 3rd Generation Partnership Project (3GPP) Long Term Evolution (LTE) wireless communication standard. However, the disclosure is applicable to network elements associated with other wireless protocols and\/or standards such as, for example, the General Packet Radio Service (GPRS) for second generation (2G) and Wideband-Code Division Multiple Access (W-CDMA) based third generation (3G) wireless networks.","In a typical wireless mobile network, a base transceiver station (BTS) (e.g., an LTE eNodeB) provides wireless communication service for mobile devices in a cell (e.g., a geographic area). The BTS enables one or more wireless devices to connect to an external packet switched network through the wireless mobile network. In these typical wireless mobile networks, a BTS is communicatively coupled to a serving gateway (e.g., a wireless network interface, router, and\/or server), which routes communications between multiple BTSs and a packet data network (PDN) gateway. The PDN gateway is an interface between the wireless mobile network and external packet switched networks. In other GPRS-based wireless mobile networks, the serving gateway provides similar functionality to a Serving GPRS Support Node (SGSN) and the PDN gateway provides similar functionality to a Gateway GPRS Support Node (GGSN).","Additionally, many wireless mobile networks include a mobility management entity (MME) that monitors mobile devices on a wireless mobile network and coordinates wireless handoffs between BTSs for the mobile devices. Wireless mobile networks also include home subscriber servers (HSS) (e.g., a home location register (HLR) that mange wireless device profiles and\/or authentication information. Collectively, BTSs, HSSs, HLRs, PDN gateways, and\/or serving gateways are referred to as network elements, which provide a foundation for providing wireless communication services for mobile devices.","To implement a wireless mobile network, a wireless mobile network provider manages and\/or configures network elements. The wireless mobile network enables customers of a wireless mobile network provider to subscribe to the wireless mobile network to receive and\/or transmit voice and\/or data communications. Many network providers configure network elements to provide wireless service to any subscribing customer of the network provider. For example, subscribing customers of a network provider may commonly access a wireless mobile network managed by the network provider.","Additionally, many network providers lease portions of their wireless mobile network to mobile virtual network operators (MVNOs). An MVNO (e.g., Virgin Mobile) is a company that provides mobile device services but does not own, control, and\/or manage its own licensed frequency allocation of a wireless spectrum and\/or does not own, control, and\/or manage network elements needed to create a wireless mobile network. Network elements are capital intensive, which results in many MVNOs desiring to avoid the relatively large costs of creating and maintaining a wireless mobile network. To provide mobile device services, an MVNO leases bandwidth and\/or portions of a wireless spectrum for subscribing customers of the MVNO. In this manner, an MVNO may compete with a wireless mobile network provider for customers but use the same wireless mobile network managed by the wireless mobile network provider.","In other instances, an MVNO may be a relatively large business and\/or government entity that leases a portion of a wireless mobile network for private and\/or proprietary use. For example, a military may lease a portion of a wireless mobile network. In these other instances, employees, agents, and\/or contractors of the MVNO use the leased portion of the wireless mobile network to communicatively couple to data centers and\/or computing elements managed by the MVNO.","Currently, many wireless mobile network providers use dedicated network elements to manage wireless communications for an MVNO. These dedicated network elements are often separate from network elements used by subscribing customers of the network provider. In other instances where it may not be efficient to provide dedicated network elements for an MVNO, a wireless mobile network provider shares network resources with an MNVO. However, this sharing may result in security issues as compromises and\/or denial of service attacks on an MVNO service can affect wireless service provided by the network provider. In other words, an issue with a portion of a wireless mobile network for an MVNO can develop into a larger issue for the wireless mobile network provider. Additionally, sharing and\/or creating individual network resources with an MVNO creates a relatively inflexible wireless mobile network that makes realization of varying service differentiating features a difficult task for a wireless mobile network provider.","The example methods, apparatus, and articles of manufacture described herein configure a wireless mobile network for security by partitioning network elements to create a virtual private mobile network (VPMN) to process and\/or route unsecure, suspect, and\/or otherwise high risk communications (e.g., problematic or potentially threatening communications). The example methods, apparatus, and articles of manufacture described herein determine problematic communications (e.g., security events) within a wireless mobile network by identifying which communications match a security event profile. For example, security event profiles may specify a known network worm, a known malicious application, and\/or a known unsecure and\/or unsupported mobile device. An unsecure mobile device includes a mobile device that does not have security updates and\/or network security protection. An unsupported mobile device includes a mobile device that is modified to operate on a wireless mobile network where the mobile device would not otherwise be able to communicatively couple to the wireless mobile network (e.g., a jail broken mobile device). A malicious application includes an application that reduces network performance by generating excessive traffic. A network worm can include any malicious program and\/or code that is embedded within a payload of network communications configured to disrupt network performance and\/or penetrate network safeguards.","The example methods, apparatus, and articles of manufacture described herein use identified potentially problematic communications to identify mobile devices associated with the communications. The example methods, apparatus, and articles of manufacture described herein then provision the identified mobile devices to communicatively couple to a VPMN designated for security that is logically separate from a wireless mobile network. In this manner, the example methods, apparatus, and articles of manufacture described herein isolate potentially problematic communications from a wireless mobile network.","A VPMN provides private network communications on shared network elements. In some instances, a VPMN may extend end-to-end on a wireless mobile network. In other instances, a VPMN may only be included within some network elements and\/or some types of network elements. To partition (e.g., virtualize) many network elements, portions of a control plane and\/or a data plane of the network elements are partitioned for a particular VPMN. Partitioning network elements may also include partitioning processing power and\/or bandwidth of the network elements for a particular VPMN to separate the VPMN from other portions of a wireless mobile network. Virtualizing VPMNs in a wireless mobile network enables the VPMNs to provide a private secure virtual circuit (and\/or a private path using similar technology such as, for example, a Multiprotocol Label Switching (MPLS) path) extending from mobile devices to an external packet switched network, other mobile devices, and\/or data centers of an MVNO.","An example VPMN designated for security routes and\/or processes potentially problematic and\/or threatening communications through a wireless mobile network separate from non-potentially problematic communications. Additionally, the example VPMN may include security protocols and\/or security tools that are not implemented in a wireless mobile network for communications that are not potentially problematic. The security protocols and\/or analysis tools analyze, diagnose, filter, block, and\/or monitor potentially problematic communications and\/or identified problematic communications. Thus, the example methods, apparatus, and articles of manufacture described herein conserve wireless mobile network resources by only using additional security protocols and\/or security tools within the example VPMN without having to deploy the additional security protocols and\/or tools to other portions of the wireless mobile network. For example, deploying an additional security protocol may increase a propagation time because the security protocol has to analyze the problematic communications. By having the additional security protocol deployed only within the secure VPMN, only propagation times of potentially problematic communications are affected.","Through the use of separate isolated VPMNs, the example methods, apparatus, and articles of manufacture described herein provide enhanced security. Thus, a compromise on a first VPMN and\/or a wireless mobile network cannot propagate to other VPMNs because the VPMNs are logically separate. As a result of enhanced security, some MVNOs with relatively more stringent security requirements can utilize VPMNs without implementing other security protocols and\/or methods.","In the interest of brevity and clarity, throughout the following disclosure, reference will be made to an example communication system  of  associated with the LTE standard. However, the methods, articles of manufacture, and apparatus described herein to configure virtual private mobile networks are applicable to other types of networks constructed using other network technologies, topologies and\/or protocols.",{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0025","num":"0024"},"figref":"FIG. 1","b":["100","102","104","102","102","104","102","106"]},"In the illustrated example, the wireless mobile network  is shown as including and\/or associated with network elements -. The example network elements - are shown as one example of communicatively coupling the mobile device  to the IP network . In other examples, the wireless mobile network  can include additional network elements and\/or different types of network elements including, for example, an MME, an HSS, and\/or a policy charging and rules function (PCRF) server. Further, the example network elements - correspond to the LTE standard. In other examples, the network elements - may be associated with any other wireless communication protocol and\/or standard including, for example, Universal Mobile Telecommunication System (UMTS) and\/or GPRS.","The example mobile device  (e.g., user equipment (UE)) of the illustrated example includes any device capable of wirelessly communicatively coupling to the wireless mobile network . For example, the mobile device  includes any laptop, smartphone, computing pad, personal digital assistant, tablet computer, personal communicator, etc. Additionally, while  shows the mobile device , in other examples, the communication system  may include additional mobile devices.","To wirelessly connect to the wireless mobile network , the wireless mobile network  includes the eNodeB . The example eNodeB  is a BTS (e.g., an access point) and includes any controllers, transmitters, receivers, and\/or signal generators to provide a wireless spectrum to facilitate wireless communication with, for example, the mobile device . The eNodeB  transforms communications received from the serving gateway  into a wireless signal transmitted to the mobile device . Similarly, the eNodeB  transforms wireless communications received from the mobile device  into a wired communications that may be routed to the IP network .","To route communications to and\/or from the eNodeB , the wireless mobile network  of  includes the serving gateway . The example serving gateway  routes and\/or forwards communications (e.g., data packets) between the PDN gateway  and mobile devices that are within a geographical area assigned to the serving gateway . Location registers within the example serving gateway  store location information including, for example, a geographic location of the eNodeB , visitor location register (VLR) information, and\/or user profile information of the mobile device . The example serving gateway  may also provide authentication and\/or charging functions to enable the mobile device  to access the wireless mobile network .","The example serving gateway  also functions as a mobility anchor for a user plane during inter-eNodeB handovers of the mobile device . In other words, the serving gateway  ensures the mobile device  is connected to an eNodeB when the mobile device  moves to a different physical location. The example serving gateway  further manages and stores contexts (e.g. parameters of the IP wireless mobile network, security events, and\/or network internal routing information) associated with the mobile device . While the wireless mobile network  of  shows the single serving gateway , the wireless mobile network  may include additional serving gateways.","To interface with the IP network  of the illustrated example, the example wireless mobile network  is associated with the PDN gateway . In this example, the PDN gateway  is communicatively coupled to the IP network  via an interface . The example PDN gateway  functions as a router by routing communications from the wireless mobile network  to an appropriate edge and\/or network router within the IP network . Also, the PDN gateway  routes communications directed to the mobile device  from the IP network  to an appropriate serving gateway (e.g., the gateway ). In some examples, the PDN gateway  may determine if the mobile device  is active (e.g., available to receive the communications) by sending a query to the serving gateway . If the serving gateway  indicates the mobile device is active , the serving gateway  sends a response to the PDN gateway  causing the PDN gateway  to forward the communications to the serving gateway . If the mobile device  is inactive and\/or unavailable, the PDN gateway  may discard the communications and\/or query other serving gateways in the wireless mobile network .","In some examples, the PDN gateway  transforms and\/or converts communications originating from the mobile device  received via the serving gateway  into an appropriate packet data protocol (PDP) format (e.g., IP, X.25, etc.) for propagation through the IP network . Additionally, for communications received from the IP network , the PDN gateway  converts the communications into a wireless protocol (e.g., 3GPP LTE, Global System for Mobile Communications (GSM), etc.). The example PDN gateway  then readdresses the communications to the corresponding serving gateway .","To configure VPMNs on the network elements -, the wireless mobile network  includes a VPMN controller . The example VPMN controller  receives requests from the network elements - to create a VPMN (e.g., a security VPMN) to isolate potentially problematic communications (and\/or identified problematic communications) originating from, for example, the mobile device . The example VPMN controller  may also receive requests from clients (e.g., MVNOs) for VPMNs. To create a VPMN, the example VPMN controller  identifies available portions of the network elements - for the requested VPMNs, and partitions control and\/or data plane space on the network elements - to configure the VPMNs. In some examples, the VPMN controller  may also configure the mobile device  to access a VPMN.","To receive requests for a VPMN, the example communication system  of  includes a Mobility-as-a-Service (Maas) portal . The MaaS portal  enables clients to specify requirements (e.g., security rules) for a VPMN. In some examples, the MaaS portal  may be an interface of the VPMN controller  that a client accesses via the IP network . In other examples, the client may directly access the VPMN controller .","In the illustrated example, a client administrator  (e.g., a client) accesses the MaaS portal  to request a VPMN. The request for a VPMN may include a list of mobile devices that are to be authorized to access the VPMN, an estimated maximum and\/or average amount of bandwidth to be utilized, a geographic location for the VPMN (including a geographic location of the eNodeB  and\/or the serving gateway ), administrative information, billing information, security event profiles, and\/or any other information that may be needed to provision a VPMN.","In response to the client administrator  requesting a VPMN, the MaaS portal , via the VPMN controller , establishes a VPMN through the network elements -. Examples of VPMNs are described below in conjunction with . To enable mobile devices associated with the client administrator  to access the newly created VPMN, the VPMN controller  assigns the VPMN an access point name (APN). The APN enables communications from identified mobile devices to be routed through the wireless mobile network  via a VPMN.","An APN identifies a PDN that a mobile device requests to communicatively couple. The APN may also define a type of service, server, and\/or multimedia message service that is provided by a PDN. Typically, an APN includes a network identifier and an operator identifier. The network identifier may define an external network to which the PDN gateway  is connected (e.g., the IP network ). The operator identifier specifies which network (e.g., VPMN) is associated with the PDN gateway . In the example of , the VPMN controller  uses operator identifiers of APNs to identify to which VPMN communications from a mobile device are to be routed.","The example VPMN controller  of the illustrated example transmits an assigned APN to subscribing customers identified to be communicatively coupled to a VPMN. The VPMN controller  also registers the APN with APN domain name system (DNS) servers  and  within the respective networks  and . Registering the APN with the APN DNS servers  and  enables communications associated with a VPMN to be routed to the appropriate VPMN on the network elements - when the VPMN controller  is unable to extend the VPMN from end-to-end (e.g., from the eNodeB  to the interface  of the PDN gateway ). Thus, the use of APNs enables the VPMN controller  to provision a VPMN over a portion of the network elements - when other network elements are not capable and\/or are not configured to host the VPMN.","To determine which communications from, for example, the mobile device  are potentially problematic and\/or threatening to the wireless mobile network , the example VPMN controller  of  includes a security processor . The example security processor  stores security rules for the wireless mobile network  that include security event profiles that specify security events associated with potentially problematic communications. The security event profiles may be specified by, for example, the client administrator , and\/or an operator of the wireless mobile network . In other examples, the example security processor  may compile and\/or aggregate security event profiles based on previously detected security events.","The example security processor  transmits the security rules to each of the VPMNs implemented on the network elements -. The security processor  may also transmit the security rules to the network elements - in instances where the network elements - process communications separate from a VPMN. In some instances, the security processor  may transmit different sets of security rules to different VPMNs based on instructions from, for example, the client administrator . For example, some client administrators may only be concerned with malicious network worms and denial of service attacks for their respective VPMNs while other client administrators are concerned with malicious applications, unsupported mobile devices, and\/or unsecure mobile devices for their respective VPMNs.","The example VPMNs and\/or the network elements - use the security rules to identify potentially problematic communications (e.g., security events). In other examples, the security processor  may monitor VPMNs and\/or the network elements - for potentially problematic communications. After detecting potentially problematic communications, the VPMNs and\/or the network elements - broadcast information about the security event and\/or an identifier of a mobile device associated with the security event to other VPMNs and\/or the security processor . The VPMNs and\/or the security processor  may then determine if, for example, the mobile device  is associated with other potentially problematic communications and transmits those identified security events.","The example security processor  and\/or the VPMNs of the illustrated example use the information regarding the security event to provision, for example, the mobile device  to a VPMN designated for security (e.g., a security VPMN). In some instances, the example network elements - may have a VPMN for security provisioned. In other examples, the security processor  provisions a VPMN after a security event is detected. The example security processor  and\/or a VPMN that detected the security event communicatively couples the mobile device  to the security VPMN. To communicatively couple the mobile device , the example security processor  and\/or the detecting VPMN uses over the air programming to send an APN of the security VPMN to the mobile device. In some examples, the over the air programming may include provisioning a subscriber identity module (SIM) card of the mobile device  with an APN corresponding to the security VPMN.","The example security VPMN processes and\/or routes communications from the mobile device . In some instances, the security VPMN may analyze the communications to identify the security event and determine a resolution (e.g., a defense strategy) to the security event. In other examples, the security VPMN may propagate the communications associated with the mobile device  through the wireless mobile network  to the IP network  separate and\/or isolated from other communications from other mobile devices. After resolving the security event, the security VPMN and\/or the security processor  migrates the mobile device  to an originally connected VPMN and\/or to the general non-VPMN portions of the network elements -.","While the above described example involves creating a general security VPMN for any detected security event, the example security processor  of  may create different security VPMNs for different types of security events. For example, a first security VPMN may be created specifically for network worms and\/or viruses and include security tools for analyzing and\/or blocking the worms and\/or viruses. Additionally, a second security VPMN may be created for malicious applications and include processing and\/or routing protocols configured to limit excessive signing traffic generated by the applications.",{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0045","num":"0044"},"figref":["FIGS. 2-4","FIG. 1"],"b":["104","202","204","202","204","104"]},"In the example of , the wireless mobile network  includes the network elements - of . Additionally, the wireless mobile network  includes an MME , an HSS , and a PCRF server . In other examples, the wireless mobile network  may include additional network elements and\/or additional types of network elements.","The example MME  tracks and pages mobile devices that are communicatively coupled to the wireless mobile network . The example MME  may also activate and\/or deactivate mobile devices and\/or authenticate mobile devices attempting to connect to the wireless mobile network  by requesting user profile information from the HSS . In some examples, the MME  may be similar to the servers  and  of  by selecting the appropriate serving gateway  and\/or PDN gateway  when mobile devices provide an APN to connect to one of the VPMNs  and .","The example HSS  of  includes a database of subscription-related information (e.g., subscribing customer profiles). The example HSS  performs authentication and\/or authorization of a mobile device attempting to access the wireless mobile network  by providing the MME  with mobile device profile information to match to profile information by the requesting mobile device. The HSS  may also include information about a geographic location of a subscribing customer and\/or IP information associated with a mobile device of the customer.","The example PCRF server  determines policy rules for the wireless mobile network . The example PCRF server  aggregates information to and\/or from the wireless mobile network  and\/or the network elements -, , and  in real time to create rules. The example PCRF  may also store security rules  that include security event profiles. Based on the created rules, the PCRF server  automatically makes intelligent policy decisions for each mobile device active on the wireless mobile network . In this manner, the PCRF server  enables a wireless mobile network provider to offer multiple services, quality of service (QoS) levels, and\/or charging rules. Additionally, the PCRF server  may also broadcast and\/or transmit the security rules to the portions of the network elements -,  and  hosting the VPMNs  and .","In the example of , the Client X requests the VPMN  from the VPMN controller  of  to enable mobile devices - to subscribe to a service offered by the Client X to connect to the IP network . The example Client X may also specify the security rules  for identifying potentially problematic and\/or threatening communications within the VPMN . In this example, the Client X may be an MVNO.","In this illustrated example, the Client X requests that the VPMN  extend end-to-end of the wireless mobile network . As a result of the request, the VPMN controller  extends the VPMN  to all of the network elements - and - within the wireless mobile network . In other examples, the Client X may only request and\/or may only be able to request a VPMN to be setup on some of the network elements - and -. By requesting the VPMN , the example VPMN controller  identifies available space within the network elements - and - and allocates control and\/or data planes of the network elements - and - for the VPMN . The VPMN controller  then configures the allocated control and\/or data plane portions of the network elements - and - for the VPMN .","To configure the network elements - and -, the example VPMN controller  may assign an APN to the VPMN  and update a control plane of the network elements  and - with the APN assignment. The VPMN controller  may also assign and\/or configure specific interfaces, switches, and\/or processors within the network elements - and - to host the VPMN .","The mobile devices - use the assigned APN to access the respective VPMN . Further, by using the APN, the network elements - and - may propagate communications within the VPMN  until an end point is reached. By using APNs, the example VPMN controller  creates exclusive virtual circuits (e.g., MPLS paths) from the eNodeB  to the PDN gateway  for routing communications within the VPMN  for the mobile devices - registered with the Client X MVNO. Thus, the APNs ensure that communications from the mobile devices - are routed through the wireless mobile network  via the VPMN .","Further, the VPMN  partitioned within the network elements - enables access control, authentication, mobile device profile management, security event profiles, and\/or network rules to be configurable for the Client X. Thus, subscriber information for the Client X within the HSS  is separate from subscriber information associated with other VPMNs (not shown) and\/or subscribers that use non-VPMN portions of the network elements - and -. The separation of the control and\/or data planes of the network elements - via the VPMN  also enables the Client X to provide different types of services using the same network elements - and -. Further, the separation of the control and\/or data planes of the network elements - via the VPMN  prevents security issues in, for example, the VPMN  from propagating to other portions of the network elements - and -.","The example wireless mobile network  of  also includes the security VPMN  within the network elements - and -. In other examples, the security VPMN  may be included only within some of the network elements - and -. In this example, the security VPMN  is provisioned for the Client X as a VPMN to process potentially problematic and\/or threatening communications detected within the VPMN . When there are relatively few potentially problematic communications to process, the example security VPMN  may allocate relatively less bandwidth and\/or processing capacity from among the network elements - and - compared to bandwidth and\/or processing capacity allocated for the VPMN .",{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0056","num":"0055"},"figref":["FIG. 3","FIG. 2"],"b":["104","302","110","302","202","302","302","110","302","216","214","110","302","212","112","202","104","116"]},"After detecting the security event , the example serving gateway  transmits information regarding the security event  to the other network elements , , and -.

For example, the serving gateway  may provision a SIM card of the mobile device  with the APN. Further, the example serving gateway  may broadcast the provisioning of the mobile device  to the security VPMN  so that the network elements , , and - route and\/or process communications associated with the mobile device  through the security VPMN  using the newly assigned APN.","Once the mobile device  is communicatively coupled to the security VPMN , additional security protocols and\/or analysis tools may determine specific information regarding the security event  and\/or the potentially problematic communications. The security protocols and\/or analysis tools may be used to determine an appropriate strategy for the mobile device . For example, the VPMN  may send a message to a user of the mobile device  that the mobile device  has been provisioned for the security VPMN  and provide actions to be completed (e.g., removing a malicious application, removing modifications from the mobile device , installing a security upgrade, and\/or deleting a network worm) before the mobile device  can be provisioned for the VPMN . In other instances, the security protocols and\/or the analysis tools of the security VPMN  may resolve the security event . In yet other instances, the security protocols and\/or analysis tools of the security VPMN  may monitor communications associated with the mobile device  to determine if other security events occur. Further, the example security VPMN  may continue to isolate communications associated with the mobile device  from the VPMN  until the mobile device  is removed from service.","The security protocols deployed within the security VPMN  may increase a propagation time of communications between the mobile device  and, for example, the IP network . However, the example security VPMN  ensures that potentially problematic and\/or threatening communications associated with the mobile device  cannot affect other communications associated with, for example, the mobile devices  and  communicatively coupled to the VPMN . In this manner, the example Client X only needs to deploy and\/or utilize additional security protocols within the portions of the network elements - and - provisioned to host the security VPMN , thereby reducing protocols configured for the VPMN . By not having to implement additional protocols for the VPMN , communication propagation times through the VPMN  and\/or processing capacity allocated for the VPMN  can be reduced. In other words, the additional protocols are only implemented in the relatively smaller security VPMN  configured specifically to process the potentially problematic communications.",{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0061","num":"0060"},"figref":["FIG. 4","FIGS. 1-3","FIGS. 1-3","FIG. 4"],"b":["202","204","108","402","404","402","202","404","204","202","204","402","404","110"]},"The example eNodeBs  and  of the illustrated example are physically separate to create isolation in a wireless spectrum between the VPMNs  and . Thus, mobile devices  provisioned for the VPMN  are communicatively coupled to the example eNodeB  and mobile devices  provisioned for the security VPMN  are communicatively coupled to the example eNodeB . In this example, the mobile devices  may be associated with identified potentially problematic communications.
