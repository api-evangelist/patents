{"@attributes":{"id":"description"},"BRFSUM":[{},{}],"heading":["FIELD OF THE INVENTION","BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION","BRIEF SUMMARY OF THE INVENTION","DETAILED DESCRIPTION OF THE INVENTION"],"p":["The present application generally relates to data communication networks. In particular, the present application relates to systems and methods for identifying a receive-side-scaling key to avoid skewed distribution of packet flows among a plurality of cores in a multi-core system.","In many implementations of a multi-core system, receive-side scaling is used to enable in-order packet delivery by ensuring that only one processor or core processes packets for a single TCP connection. A network adapter or other module may examine each packet header for information identifying the TCP connection, and then apply a hashing function to create an identifier for the packet. The result of the hashing function is used as an index into a table that identifies a specific processor or core, and the packet is directed to the corresponding processor or core.","The hashing function may be selected in an attempt to achieve equal distribution across the table, and may use a hash key or seed created by a random or pseudorandom number generator. However, for some hashing functions commonly used in receive-side scaling, certain hash keys may result in an uneven distribution. Using one of these hash keys as an input to the hashing function may result in some entries of the table that are unused, such that no TCP packet, no matter the header information, may be directed to the corresponding processor or core. This may result in unbalancing, inefficiency of the multi-core system, and require computationally-intensive load rebalancing and inter-core packet transfers.","The present application is directed towards systems and methods for improving distribution of packet flows among a plurality of cores in a multi-core system by identifying a rank of a matrix created from a hash key. If the rank of the matrix is equal to or greater than a divisor of a modulo operation applied to the results of the hash function, then the hash key may be used to ensure equal distribution of packet flows. The systems and methods described herein provided techniques to avoid using a receive-side-scaling (RSS) key that may provide skewed distribution results among the plurality of cores.","In one aspect, the present invention features a method for improving distribution of packet flows among a plurality of cores in a multi-core system. The method includes a flow distributor executing on a multi-core system receiving a first random number key for a hash function. The method also includes the flow distributor creating a first n-rowed matrix from the first random number key, wherein a first row of the first matrix comprises m-bits of the first random number key starting from a first position, and each successive row comprises m-bits of the first random number key starting from a position shifted from the previous position by a predetermined value. The method also includes the flow distributor identifying a rank of the first matrix. The method further includes the flow distributor determining that the rank of the first matrix is less than the number n of rows of the first matrix. The method also includes the flow distributor requesting, responsive to the determination, a second random number key for the hash function. With these techniques, when a new key is generated, the key can be checked whether it is likely to produce undesirable distribution results and thus, a new key may be obtained instead.","In a further embodiment, the method includes the flow distributor receiving, responsive to the request, the second random number key for the hash function. In this embodiment, the method also includes the flow distributor creating a second n-rowed matrix from the second random number key, wherein a first row of the second matrix comprises m-bits of the second random number key starting from a first position, and each successive row comprises m-bits of the second random number key starting from a position shifted from the previous position by a predetermined value.

In another embodiment, the method includes the flow distributor performing a forward elimination algorithm on the matrix.","In still another embodiment, the method includes the flow distributor identifying a first pivot row of the matrix by locating the first row of the matrix to have a nonzero element, scanning the elements of each column downwards starting from a most significant bit column and proceeding to a least significant bit column. The method also includes the flow distributor flipping the first pivot row of the matrix with the first row of the matrix. The method also includes, for each remaining row of the matrix with a nonzero element in a pivot column, replacing the row with the result of an exclusive-or (XOR) of the first pivot row and said row.","In a further embodiment, the method includes the flow distributor identifying an additional pivot row by locating a first row of the remaining rows of the matrix to have a nonzero element, flipping the located row with a row corresponding to the order in which the pivot row was located, and for each remaining row of the matrix, replacing the row with the result of an XOR of the additional pivot row and said row.","In another further embodiment, the method includes the flow distributor determining the number of identified pivot rows of the matrix.

Systems and Methods for Providing a Multi-Core Architecture","In accordance with Moore's Law, the number of transistors that may be placed on an integrated circuit may double approximately every two years. However, CPU speed increases may reach plateaus, for example CPU speed has been around 3.5-4 GHz range since 2005. In some cases, CPU manufacturers may not rely on CPU speed increases to gain additional performance. Some CPU manufacturers may add additional cores to their processors to provide additional performance. Products, such as those of software and networking vendors, that rely on CPUs for performance gains may improve their performance by leveraging these multi-core CPUs. The software designed and constructed for a single CPU may be redesigned and\/or rewritten to take advantage of a multi-threaded, parallel architecture or otherwise a multi-core architecture.","A multi-core architecture of the appliance , referred to as nCore or multi-core technology, allows the appliance in some embodiments to break the single core performance barrier and to leverage the power of multi-core CPUs.

In some embodiments, this provides up to a 7\u00d7 increase in performance and scalability.","Illustrated in  are some embodiments of work, task, load or network traffic distribution across one or more processor cores according to a type of parallelism or parallel computing scheme, such as functional parallelism, data parallelism or flow-based data parallelism. In brief overview,  illustrates embodiments of a multi-core system such as an appliance \u2032 with n-cores, a total of cores numbers  through N. In one embodiment, work, load or network traffic can be distributed among a first core A, a second core B, a third core C, a fourth core D, a fifth core E, a sixth core F, a seventh core G, and so on such that distribution is across all or two or more of the n cores N (hereinafter referred to collectively as cores .) There may be multiple VIPs  each running on a respective core of the plurality of cores. There may be multiple packet engines  each running on a respective core of the plurality of cores. Any of the approaches used may lead to different, varying or similar work load or performance level  across any of the cores. For a functional parallelism approach, each core may run a different function of the functionalities provided by the packet engine, a VIP  or appliance . In a data parallelism approach, data may be paralleled or distributed across the cores based on the Network Interface Card (NIC) or VIP  receiving the data. In another data parallelism approach, processing may be distributed across the cores by distributing data flows to each core.","In further detail to , in some embodiments, load, work or network traffic can be distributed among cores  according to functional parallelism . Functional parallelism may be based on each core performing one or more respective functions. In some embodiments, a first core may perform a first function while a second core performs a second function. In functional parallelism approach, the functions to be performed by the multi-core system are divided and distributed to each core according to functionality. In some embodiments, functional parallelism may be referred to as task parallelism and may be achieved when each processor or core executes a different process or function on the same or different data. The core or processor may execute the same or different code. In some cases, different execution threads or code may communicate with one another as they work. Communication may take place to pass data from one thread to the next as part of a workflow.","In some embodiments, distributing work across the cores  according to functional parallelism , can comprise distributing network traffic according to a particular function such as network input\/output management (NW I\/O) A, secure sockets layer (SSL) encryption and decryption B and transmission control protocol (TCP) functions C. This may lead to a work, performance or computing load  based on a volume or level of functionality being used. In some embodiments, distributing work across the cores  according to data parallelism , can comprise distributing an amount of work  based on distributing data associated with a particular hardware or software component. In some embodiments, distributing work across the cores  according to flow-based data parallelism , can comprise distributing data based on a context or flow such that the amount of work A-N on each core may be similar, substantially equal or relatively evenly distributed.","In the case of the functional parallelism approach, each core may be configured to run one or more functionalities of the plurality of functionalities provided by the packet engine or VIP of the appliance. For example, core  may perform network I\/O processing for the appliance \u2032 while core  performs TCP connection management for the appliance. Likewise, core  may perform SSL offloading while core  may perform layer  or application layer processing and traffic management. Each of the cores may perform the same function or different functions. Each of the cores may perform more than one function. Any of the cores may run any of the functionality or portions thereof identified and\/or described in conjunction with . In this the approach, the work across the cores may be divided by function in either a coarse-grained or fine-grained manner. In some cases, as illustrated in , division by function may lead to different cores running at different levels of performance or load .","In the case of the functional parallelism approach, each core may be configured to run one or more functionalities of the plurality of functionalities provided by the packet engine of the appliance. For example, core  may perform network I\/O processing for the appliance \u2032 while core  performs TCP connection management for the appliance. Likewise, core  may perform SSL offloading while core  may perform layer  or application layer processing and traffic management.

In this the approach, the work across the cores may be divided by function in either a coarse-grained or fine-grained manner. In some cases, as illustrated in  division by function may lead to different cores running at different levels of load or performance.","The functionality or tasks may be distributed in any arrangement and scheme. For example,  illustrates a first core, Core  A, processing applications and processes associated with network I\/O functionality A. Network traffic associated with network I\/O, in some embodiments, can be associated with a particular port number. Thus, outgoing and incoming packets having a port destination associated with NW I\/O A will be directed towards Core  A which is dedicated to handling all network traffic associated with the NW I\/O port. Similarly, Core  B is dedicated to handling functionality associated with SSL processing and Core  D may be dedicated handling all TCP level processing and functionality.","While  illustrates functions such as network I\/O, SSL and TCP, other functions can be assigned to cores. These other functions can include any one or more of the functions or operations described herein. For example, any of the functions described in conjunction with  may be distributed across the cores on a functionality basis. In some cases, a first VIP A may run on a first core while a second VIP B with a different configuration may run on a second core. In some embodiments, each core  can handle a particular functionality such that each core  can handle the processing associated with that particular function. For example, Core  B may handle SSL offloading while Core  D may handle application layer processing and traffic management.","In other embodiments, work, load or network traffic may be distributed among cores  according to any type and form of data parallelism . In some embodiments, data parallelism may be achieved in a multi-core system by each core performing the same task or functionally on different pieces of distributed data. In some embodiments, a single execution thread or code controls operations on all pieces of data. In other embodiments, different threads or instructions control the operation, but may execute the same code. In some embodiments, data parallelism is achieved from the perspective of a packet engine, vServers (VIPs) A-C, network interface cards (NIC) D-E and\/or any other networking hardware or software included on or associated with an appliance . For example, each core may run the same packet engine or VIP code or configuration but operate on different sets of distributed data. Each networking hardware or software construct can receive different, varying or substantially the same amount of data, and as a result may have varying, different or relatively the same amount of load .","In the case of a data parallelism approach, the work may be divided up and distributed based on VIPs, NICs and\/or data flows of the VIPs or NICs. In one of these approaches, the work of the multi-core system may be divided or distributed among the VIPs by having each VIP work on a distributed set of data. For example, each core may be configured to run one or more VIPs. Network traffic may be distributed to the core for each VIP handling that traffic. In another of these approaches, the work of the appliance may be divided or distributed among the cores based on which NIC receives the network traffic. For example, network traffic of a first NIC may be distributed to a first core while network traffic of a second NIC may be distributed to a second core. In some cases, a core may process data from multiple NICs.","While  illustrates a single vServer associated with a single core , as is the case for VIP A, VIP B and VIP C. In some embodiments, a single vServer can be associated with one or more cores . In contrast, one or more vServers can be associated with a single core . Associating a vServer with a core  may include that core  to process all functions associated with that particular vServer. In some embodiments, each core executes a VIP having the same code and configuration. In other embodiments, each core executes a VIP having the same code but different configuration. In some embodiments, each core executes a VIP having different code and the same or different configuration.","Like vServers, NICs can also be associated with particular cores . In many embodiments, NICs can be connected to one or more cores  such that when a NIC receives or transmits data packets, a particular core  handles the processing involved with receiving and transmitting the data packets. In one embodiment, a single NIC can be associated with a single core , as is the case with NIC D and NIC E. In other embodiments, one or more NICs can be associated with a single core . In other embodiments, a single NIC can be associated with one or more cores . In these embodiments, load could be distributed amongst the one or more cores  such that each core  processes a substantially similar amount of load. A core  associated with a NIC may process all functions and\/or data associated with that particular NIC.","While distributing work across cores based on data of VIPs or NICs may have a level of independency, in some embodiments, this may lead to unbalanced use of cores as illustrated by the varying loads  of .","In some embodiments, load, work or network traffic can be distributed among cores  based on any type and form of data flow. In another of these approaches, the work may be divided or distributed among cores based on data flows. For example, network traffic between a client and a server traversing the appliance may be distributed to and processed by one core of the plurality of cores. In some cases, the core initially establishing the session or connection may be the core for which network traffic for that session or connection is distributed. In some embodiments, the data flow is based on any unit or portion of network traffic, such as a transaction, a request\/response communication or traffic originating from an application on a client. In this manner and in some embodiments, data flows between clients and servers traversing the appliance \u2032 may be distributed in a more balanced manner than the other approaches.","In flow-based data parallelism , distribution of data is related to any type of flow of data, such as request\/response pairings, transactions, sessions, connections or application communications. For example, network traffic between a client and a server traversing the appliance may be distributed to and processed by one core of the plurality of cores. In some cases, the core initially establishing the session or connection may be the core for which network traffic for that session or connection is distributed. The distribution of data flow may be such that each core  carries a substantially equal or relatively evenly distributed amount of load, data or network traffic.","In some embodiments, the data flow is based on any unit or portion of network traffic, such as a transaction, a request\/response communication or traffic originating from an application on a client. In this manner and in some embodiments, data flows between clients and servers traversing the appliance \u2032 may be distributed in a more balanced manner than the other approached. In one embodiment, data flow can be distributed based on a transaction or a series of transactions. This transaction, in some embodiments, can be between a client and a server and can be characterized by an IP address or other packet identifier. For example, Core  A can be dedicated to transactions between a particular client and a particular server, therefore the load A on Core  A may be comprised of the network traffic associated with the transactions between the particular client and server. Allocating the network traffic to Core  A can be accomplished by routing all data packets originating from either the particular client or server to Core  A.","While work or load can be distributed to the cores based in part on transactions, in other embodiments load or work can be allocated on a per packet basis. In these embodiments, the appliance  can intercept data packets and allocate them to a core  having the least amount of load. For example, the appliance  could allocate a first incoming data packet to Core  A because the load A on Core  is less than the load B-N on the rest of the cores B-N. Once the first data packet is allocated to Core  A, the amount of load A on Core  A is increased proportional to the amount of processing resources needed to process the first data packet. When the appliance  intercepts a second data packet, the appliance  will allocate the load to Core  D because Core  D has the second least amount of load. Allocating data packets to the core with the least amount of load can, in some embodiments, ensure that the load A-N distributed to each core  remains substantially equal.","In other embodiments, load can be allocated on a per unit basis where a section of network traffic is allocated to a particular core . The above-mentioned example illustrates load balancing on a per\/packet basis. In other embodiments, load can be allocated based on a number of packets such that every 10, 100 or 1000 packets are allocated to the core  having the least amount of load. The number of packets allocated to a core  can be a number determined by an application, user or administrator and can be any number greater than zero. In still other embodiments, load can be allocated based on a time metric such that packets are distributed to a particular core  for a predetermined amount of time. In these embodiments, packets can be distributed to a particular core  for five milliseconds or for any period of time determined by a user, program, system, administrator or otherwise. After the predetermined time period elapses, data packets are transmitted to a different core  for the predetermined period of time.","Flow-based data parallelism methods for distributing work, load or network traffic among the one or more cores  can comprise any combination of the above-mentioned embodiments. These methods can be carried out by any part of the appliance , by an application or set of executable instructions executing on one of the cores , such as the packet engine, or by any application, program or agent executing on a computing device in communication with the appliance .","The functional and data parallelism computing schemes illustrated in  can be combined in any manner to generate a hybrid parallelism or distributed processing scheme that encompasses function parallelism , data parallelism , flow-based data parallelism  or any portions thereof. In some cases, the multi-core system may use any type and form of load balancing schemes to distribute load among the one or more cores . The load balancing scheme may be used in any combination with any of the functional and data parallelism schemes or combinations thereof.","Illustrated in  is an embodiment of a multi-core system , which may be any type and form of one or more systems, appliances, devices or components. This system , in some embodiments, can be included within an appliance  having one or more processing cores A-N. The system  can further include one or more packet engines (PE) or packet processing engines (PPE) A-N communicating with a memory bus . The memory bus may be used to communicate with the one or more processing cores A-N. Also included within the system  can be one or more network interface cards (NIC)  and a flow distributor  which can further communicate with the one or more processing cores A-N. The flow distributor  can comprise a Receive Side Scaler (RSS) or Receive Side Scaling (RSS) module .","Further referring to , and in more detail, in one embodiment the packet engine(s) A-N can comprise any portion of the appliance  described herein, such as any portion of the appliance described in . The packet engine(s) A-N can, in some embodiments, comprise any of the following elements: the packet engine , a network stack ; a cache manager ; a policy engine ; a compression engine ; an encryption engine ; a GUI ; a CLI ; shell services ; monitoring programs ; and any other software or hardware element able to receive data packets from one of either the memory bus  or the one of more cores A-N.

When a packet engine  becomes associated with a particular entity, that packet engine  can process data packets associated with that entity. For example, should a packet engine  be associated with a first user, that packet engine  will process and operate on packets generated by the first user, or packets having a destination address associated with the first user. Similarly, the packet engine  may choose not to be associated with a particular entity such that the packet engine  can process and otherwise operate on any data packets not generated by that entity or destined for that entity.","In some instances, the packet engine(s) A-N can be configured to carry out the any of the functional and\/or data parallelism schemes illustrated in .

In some embodiments, a single packet engine(s) A-N carries out a load balancing scheme, while in other embodiments one or more packet engine(s) A-N carry out a load balancing scheme. Each core A-N, in one embodiment, can be associated with a particular packet engine  such that load balancing can be carried out by the packet engine. Load balancing may in this embodiment, require that each packet engine A-N associated with a core  communicate with the other packet engines associated with cores so that the packet engines A-N can collectively determine where to distribute load. One embodiment of this process can include an arbiter that receives votes from each packet engine for load. The arbiter can distribute load to each packet engine A-N based in part on the age of the engine's vote and in some cases a priority value associated with the current amount of load on an engine's associated core .","Any of the packet engines running on the cores may run in user mode, kernel or any combination thereof.

That is, in the illustrated embodiment, 2 GB of each core excluding the control plane core or core  may be used to form a 28 GB shared global cache. The configuration of the control plane such as via the configuration services may determine the amount of memory used for the shared global cache. In some embodiments, each core may provide a different amount of memory for use by the global cache. In other embodiments, any one core may not provide any memory or use the global cache. In some embodiments, any of the cores may also have a local cache in memory not allocated to the global shared memory.

In other embodiments, each core  can have a predetermined amount of memory. The global cache  can comprise an amount of the memory allocated to each core .

Systems and Methods for Ensuring Equal Distribution of Packet Flows Among a Plurality of Cores in a Multi-Core System","As discussed above with regard to , flow distributor  may comprise a receive-side scaling driver or module  or employ receive-side scaling or similar techniques for distributing packets among cores. Also as discussed above, in many embodiments, receive-side scaling and similar techniques utilize a Toeplitz hash and a hash key. A Toeplitz hash is one in which a bitwise exclusive-or (XOR) is applied to each bit of an input string and a portion of a hash key. For each successive bit of the input string, the portion of the hash key is shifted by one bit. In some embodiments, this may be achieved by performing a bit shift on the hash key. For example, in the Microsoft RSS scheme, a 16-byte (128-bit) key is utilized for IPv4. For each bit in the input string, if the bit is equal to 1, then a calculation of a bitwise XOR is performed against the left-most 32 bits of the hash key. Before the next bit is calculated, the hash key is shifted left by one bit position. This is referred to as a Toeplitz hash because if each successive segment of the hash key is entered into a row of a matrix, the matrix forms a Toeplitz matrix, or a matrix in which each descending diagonal is constant. For example, given a hash key of \u201cabcdefghijkl\u201d, using the left-most 6 bits for each bitwise XOR calculation and then shifting the key by one bit to the left will result in a first segment of \u201cabcdef\u201d, a second segment of \u201cbcdefg\u201d, a third segment of \u201ccdefgh\u201d, etc.:","a b c d e f","b c d e f g","c d e f g h","d e f g h i . . .","Accordingly, if the input bit stream is considered to be a column matrix of size m\u00d71 and the hash output is considered to be a row matrix of size 1\u00d7n, the Toeplitz or hash matrix may considered to be a matrix of size m\u00d7n. In the Microsoft RSS scheme, n may be equal to 32, and m may vary depending on the size of the tuple used as an input. Thus, in some embodiments, the Toeplitz hash function may be equivalent to [result]=[input]\u00d7[hash matrix] (wherein each matrix is of the sizes discussed above, and the operation is an XOR). Additionally, depending on the bit shift direction, the matrix formed may alternately be a Hankel matrix. However, the methods and systems discussed herein apply equally to hash functions of either type.","While the Toeplitz hash function generally creates an evenly distributed hash, some hash keys may result in an unevenly distributed hash. For example, certain hash keys may result in hash function outputs that never fall into certain buckets in the indirection table, no matter what the input bit string is. This may result in under-utilization of cores or packet engines or imbalanced utilization, resulting in the need for load balancing and other remedies. These hash keys may be referred to as \u201cbad\u201d hash keys, as opposed to a \u201cgood\u201d hash key that results in an even distribution. One possible solution is to simply select one \u201cgood\u201d hash key and always use it. However, always using the same hash key may allow a malicious attacker to send packets or data flows that are intentionally directed to a single core to overload and imbalance the system. Another possible solution is to have a predetermined list of \u201cgood\u201d hash keys, and new keys are chosen exclusively from the list. However, this still may be susceptible to malicious attacks. Other possible solutions include executing a second hash function, such as an MD5 hash, on the result of the Toeplitz hash function, to more evenly distribute the result. However, this may be computationally intensive.","The methods and systems described herein may be utilized to determine if a randomly generated hash key is a \u201cgood\u201d key or a \u201cbad\u201d key that would result in an uneven distribution of packets and data flows among a plurality of cores. As discussed above, the Toeplitz hash function may be equivalent to [result]=[input]\u00d7[hash matrix]. With a \u201cbad\u201d key, there may be empty results, such that for a given key and any input, the result will never be equal to certain values. Alternately, this can be considered as [result]=[null]\u00d7[hash matrix], in that there exists no input that can be calculated against the hash matrix to equal certain results. Because these empty results correspond to buckets or entries in the indirection table, the core associated with the bucket or entry may receive no packet flows, resulting in unbalanced loads, as discussed above.","Because [result]=[input]\u00d7[hash matrix], the calculation can be reversed to [result]\u00d7[hash matrix]=[input], wherein [hash matrix]is the inverse of the Toeplitz matrix. Reversing the calculation this way results in no empty results or buckets, because for any bucket, there is a corresponding input. This is only possible if the hash matrix is invertible. Non-square matrixes are not invertible, and if m and n discussed above are different values, such as 32 bits and 48 bits, the hash matrix is not square. Furthermore, a square matrix is only invertible if all of the columns are linearly independent, such that no column can be written as a linear combination of the other columns.","The number of linearly independent columns of a matrix is always equal to the number of linearly independent rows of the matrix, and is frequently referred to as the rank of the matrix. For a square matrix of size m\u00d7m, the maximum number of linearly independent columns or rows is m. For a non-square matrix of size m\u00d7n, in which m>n, the maximum number of linearly independent columns is n, because the number of linearly independent columns and rows must be equal and cannot be greater than the number of rows n.","In many embodiments as discussed above in connection the RSS module , a bit mask of one or more bits is applied to the result of the Toeplitz hash. For example, in many embodiments, a 7-bit bit mask is applied to the result, and the 128 possible results correspond to the entries of a 128-slot indirection table. Thus, in some embodiments, while the result of the hash may be 48 bits as discussed above or another value, the only bits that matter for the purpose of the indirection table are the bits that pass the bit mask, such as the seven least-significant bits. Therefore, the number of rows of the matrix that vary the value of the hash result after the bit mask is equal to the size of the bit mask. Accordingly, if the hash matrix with size m\u00d7n with m>n had n equal to the size of the bit mask and had the maximum number n of linearly independent columns, and the matrix was truncated such that the truncated m=n, then the resulting matrix would be invertible. As discussed above, if the resulting matrix is invertible, then the calculation [result]\u00d7[hash matrix]=[input] may be performed, and the hash key will result in an equal distribution across the indirection table. Furthermore, the hash matrix need not actually be truncated. Rather, the hash matrix needs merely to have a rank equal to or greater than the size of the bit mask. Thus, in an embodiment with a bit mask of 7 bits, if a hash matrix has a rank of at least 7, then the hash key is a \u201cgood\u201d key. Alternately, if the hash matrix has a rank of 6 or less, then the hash key is a \u201cbad\u201d key.","In many embodiments, the rank of a matrix may be determined by converting the matrix to echelon form and identifying the number of non-zero rows. In some embodiments, the matrix may be converted to echelon form through forward elimination or Gaussian elimination, using elementary row operations. In other elements, Forward elimination involves transforming the columns of the matrix from left to right, with the column undergoing transformation referred to as the pivot column, the diagonal element in the column referred to as the pivot, and the row containing the diagonal element referred to as the pivot row. For example, for a leftmost column of a matrix, the first element is the pivot and the topmost row is the pivot row. For the second leftmost column, third leftmost column, the third element is the pivot and the third topmost row is the pivot row.","To transform a column, the first element of the column with a value of 1 is located, starting at the pivot and working downwards. If this element isn't in the pivot row, then the row containing the element with a value of 1 is moved to the pivot row, and the previous pivot row is moved to the row previously containing the element. For example, if the current pivot row is row , and the first non-zero element in column  is located in row , then row  is moved to row  and row  is moved to row , flipping the two rows. In some embodiments, this may involve writing a first row to a temporary memory location, overwriting the first row with the values of a second row, and then overwriting the second row with the values of the first row stored in the temporary memory location. Once the row containing the element with a value of 1 is in the pivot row, then for each row below the pivot row also containing an element with a value of 1, the elements of the row are replaced with the result of an XOR of said row with the pivot row. This results in the pivot having a nonzero value, and every row below the pivot having a value of 0. This process is repeated, moving to the right for a new pivot column each time, until all pivot rows have been identified. In the case a column has no elements with a value of 1, then the process continues with the pivot column to the right. Once all pivot rows have been located, the rank of the matrix may be determined by counting the number of nonzero rows.","In an alternate embodiment, if a section of m bits within the hash key corresponding to the end of a tuple have a repeating pattern with a rate less than the size of the bit mask, then the system may determine that the hash key is a \u201cbad\u201d key. For example, in one such embodiment wherein the tuple length is 48 bits, the bit mask is 7 bits, and the number of bits used for computing the hash is 32, the section of bits corresponding to the end of the tuple may be from bit  (48\u22127) to  (48+32). If these bits have a pattern that repeats at a rate of less than 7 bits, then a Toeplitz matrix created from this section of the hash key may have a rank less than 7. For example, if the 32 bits were \u201c101010 . . . \u201d, \u201c110110110 . . . \u201d, \u201c10011001 . . . \u201d or any other repeating pattern, then two or more rows of the Toeplitz matrix may be identical. Accordingly, when an XOR of a pivot row is calculated against the identical row, the result will be a zero row, resulting in one less independent column.","Referring now to , shown is a block diagram of an embodiment of a system for ensuring equal distribution of packet flows among a plurality of cores in a multi-core system.

Briefly, at step , a flow distributor may receive a hash key from a random or pseudorandom number generator. At step , the flow distributor may create a matrix from the hash key. At step , the flow distributor may identify a pivot row of the matrix. At step , the flow distributor may flip the identified pivot row to a pivot position of the matrix. At step , the flow distributor may XOR the pivot row against any remaining rows of the matrix. At step , the flow distributor may determine if there are remaining pivot rows in the matrix, and responsive to the determination, repeat steps -. At step , the flow distributor may identify a rank of the matrix. At step , the flow distributor may determine if the rank of the matrix is less than the number of rows of the matrix. If so, the flow distributor may discard the hash key and repeat steps -. If not, then at step , the flow distributor may receive a data packet. At step , the flow distributor may calculate a hash using the hash key and distribute the data packet to a core.","Still referring to  and in more detail, in some embodiments at step , a flow distributor may receive a hash key. In other embodiments, receiving a hash key may comprise the flow distributor retrieving a hash key from a memory location such as \/dev\/random\/, or requesting a hash key from a service or other process, such as a random or pseudorandom number generator. In some embodiments, the hash key may be a predetermined length. For example, in the RSS scheme used by Microsoft Corp., the hash key may be 40 bytes for IPv6 or 16 bytes for IPv4. In other embodiments, the hash key may be any other length, or may be of a nonpredetermined length.","At step , in some embodiments, the flow distributor may create a matrix from the hash key or a portion of the hash key. In one embodiment, the flow distributor may create a Toeplitz or Hankel matrix, in which each successive row includes one or more values of the prior row shifted by one column. In some embodiments, the matrix may have a predetermined number of rows n and\/or columns m. For example, in one embodiment in which a hash function uses 32 bits of the hash key for calculating a hash of each input bit, the matrix may have 32 columns. In another embodiment in which the hash function uses 16 bits of the hash key for calculating a hash of each input bit, the matrix may have 16 columns. Similarly, in an embodiment in which a bit mask to be applied to the result of the hash calculation is 7 bits, the matrix may have 7 rows. In some embodiments, the flow distributor may create the matrix from a portion of the hash key corresponding to the end bit or bits of a tuple. For example, in one such embodiment in which flow distributor uses a 4-tuple of source IP (32 bits), destination IP (32 bites), source port (16 bits), and destination port (16 bits), the bit mask is 7 bits, and the hash function uses 32 bits, the flow distributor may create the matrix using a portion of the hash key from bit  (32+32+16+16\u22127) to bit  (32+32+16+16+32). In another embodiment in which the flow distributor uses a 2-tuple of source port (16 bits) and destination port (16 bits), a bit mask of 6 bits, and a hash function of 24 bits, the flow distributor may create the matrix using a portion of the hash key from bit  (16+16\u22126) to bit  (16+16+24). Accordingly, in many embodiments, the flow distributor may create an n-rowed matrix with m-columns, wherein the first row of the matrix comprises m-bits of the hash key starting from a first position in the hash key, and each successive row comprises m-bits of the hash key starting from a position shifted from the previous position by a predetermined number. In some embodiments, the predetermined number may be one, such that the matrix formed is a Toeplitz or Hankel matrix.","In some embodiments at step , the flow distributor may identify a pivot row of the matrix. Identifying a pivot row of the matrix may comprise checking the value of each element of a matrix to find the first nonzero element, starting at a first predetermined column and second predetermined row and moving down through each column before moving to the column to the right, and ignoring all elements above the second predetermined row. Once a nonzero element has been found, the row containing the nonzero element may be identified as a pivot row, and the first predetermined column may be incremented for the next iteration of step  to be the column to the right of the nonzero element. In one embodiment, for the first iteration, the flow distributor may set a first variable i, representing the current column, to 1 and a second variable j, representing the current row, to 1. Starting at row i, the flow distributor may scan column j for a nonzero element. If none are found, the flow distributor may increment j by one and scan the next row. In some embodiments, row i may be referred to as the pivot row, and column j may be referred to as the pivot column. Variables i and j need not be equal to each other.","At step , in some embodiments, the identified pivot row may be flipped to the pivot position. In one embodiment, the flow distributor may store a first row currently in the pivot position in a temporary buffer or memory location, overwrite the first row with the pivot row, and then overwrite the previous pivot row with the first row. In some embodiments, flipping two rows may be done in a single operation, while in other embodiments, several read and write operations may need to be performed. In some embodiments, the pivot position may be identified by the variable i, discussed above with regard to step . The pivot position may also be considered as the topmost row that is being scanned for nonzero elements. Alternately, the pivot position may be the row corresponding to the iteration of steps -. For example, for the first iteration, the pivot position may be the first row. For the second iteration, the pivot position may be the second row. For the third iteration, the pivot position may be the third row.","At step , in some embodiments, the flow distributor may calculate one or more results of an XOR of the pivot row and one or more other rows in the matrix. In one embodiment, the flow distributor may calculate one or more results of an XOR of the pivot row and one or more rows below the pivot row. For example, if the pivot row is row , in such an embodiment, the flow distributor may only calculate the results of an XOR of row  against rows , , , or any additional row, but not rows  or . In a further embodiment, the flow distributor may replace each of the one or more other rows with the one or more corresponding XOR results. In some embodiments, the flow distributor may only XOR the pivot row against other rows that have a nonzero value in the pivot column. For example, if the pivot row is row  and the pivot column is column , and row  and  do not have nonzero values in column , then in these embodiments, the flow distributor may not XOR the pivot row against row  or . Alternately, if a row does have a nonzero value in the pivot column, such as row , the flow distributor may XOR the pivot row and row . In some embodiments where there are no nonzero elements in the remaining rows of the matrix, the flow distributor may perform no XOR operations at this step. In an alternate embodiment not illustrated, at step , the flow distributor may use any other elementary row operations to remove nonzero elements from the remaining rows. For example, in one such embodiment, the flow distributor may subtract the values of elements in the pivot row from the values of the other rows.","At step , the flow distributor may determine if there are more rows remaining in the matrix. In some embodiments, once the flow distributor has performed all necessary XOR operations, the flow distributor may increment i and j, such that in the next iteration of step , the flow distributor begins scanning from the next column and next row. Accordingly, in these embodiments, the flow distributor may compare the variable i to the number of rows in the matrix, and if i is greater than the number of rows, the flow distributor may proceed to step . If there are more remaining rows in the matrix, the flow distributor may, in some embodiments, repeat steps -. In another embodiment, the flow distributor may check remaining rows for nonzero elements before repeating steps -, and proceed to step  if all remaining elements are zero. For example, if the flow distributor has only performed steps - twice in a matrix with 7 rows, the flow distributor would normally perform these steps 5 more times. However, in this embodiment, if the remaining rows - had no nonzero elements, the flow distributor may skip these steps and proceed directly to step . In still another embodiment, the flow distributor may determine that there are no nonzero elements in these rows by performing the functions described above with respect to step . In such a case, the flow distributor may skip steps - and proceed to step .","At step , in some embodiments, the flow distributor may identify a rank of the matrix. In one embodiment, the flow distributor may identify a rank of the matrix by determining the number of nonzero rows. In a further embodiment, the flow distributor may identify a rank of the matrix by summing the elements of each row and incrementing a variable representing the rank of the matrix if the summation is nonzero.","At step , the flow distributor may determine if the rank of the matrix is less than the number of rows of the matrix. If the rank is less than the number of rows of the matrix, then in some embodiments, the flow distributor may discard the hash key, the hash key having been identified as a \u201cbad\u201d key. In a further embodiment, the flow distributor may receive and\/or request a new hash key from the random or pseudorandom number generator. In these embodiments, the method may repeat steps -. Alternately, if the rank of the matrix is equal to the number of rows of the matrix, then the method may proceed to step , the hash key having been identified as a \u201cgood\u201d key.","At step , in some embodiments, the flow distributor may receive one or more data packets. In one embodiment, the flow distributor may receive one or more data packets via a network interface for processing by a core. At step , the flow distributor may calculate a hash or hashes using the identified \u201cgood\u201d hash key and a tuple of bits of the one or more data packets, and distribute the packets to one or more cores, responsive to the hash result and an indirection table, as discussed above.","Illustrated in  are examples of an embodiment of the method described above applied, respectively, to a \u201cbad\u201d key and a \u201cgood\u201d key. These examples are intended to be explanatory and non-limiting. For instance, both examples utilize a 16\u00d77 matrix. However, as discussed above, in some embodiments, different row and column sizes may be used, depending on the bit mask and hash function. Thus, these examples should be read as exemplary and in no way limiting the scope of the described methods or systems.","Referring to the example shown in  first, the flow distributor may receive a hash key, a portion of which is shown as a hexadecimal string. In some embodiments, all or a portion of the key, such as the bolded portion, may be converted to a binary string as shown. In other embodiments, the hash key may be received as a binary string, and no conversion may be necessary. An m\u00d7n matrix may be created from the binary string, wherein the value of m is the number of bits of the key that are applied to an input string in a Toeplitz hash function. As discussed above, this may be 32 bits, as in the Microsoft RSS implementation, or may be any other number, including 16 bits as shown. The value of n may correspond to a bitmask or modulus function applied to the result of the Toeplitz hash function, or may be a value such that 2 raised to the power of n is equal to the number of entries in an indirection table. As discussed above, in some embodiments, n may be 6 or 7 or any other value. As shown, the matrix is created by selecting a first m bits of the portion of the hash key and filling the first row with these bits. Each successive row is then filled using m bits starting from the next bit of the hash key.","The flow distributor may find the first pivot row by starting at row , column  and working downwards to find the first nonzero element. In the example shown in , the first element is nonzero. Accordingly, here, the first row is the first pivot row. For each of the rows in the first pivot column after the first pivot row that have a nonzero element (rows , ,  and ), an XOR of the row and the pivot row is calculated and the result is placed into the corresponding row: the result of (row ) XOR (row ) is placed in row , (row ) XOR (row ) is placed in row , etc. This results in the pivot element in row , column  being the only nonzero element in the pivot column.","Moving to the next column and starting in the row below the previous pivot row, the flow distributor may find the next pivot row by finding the first nonzero element, in this case in row , column . Pivot row  is flipped with row  so that the second pivot row is now in the second row of the matrix. As with the first pivot row, the second pivot row is XORed against any remaining rows with nonzero elements in the pivot column, such as rows , , and . Row  is ignored, as it is higher than the current pivot row.","Similarly, the third pivot row is found by the first nonzero element in row , column , and it is XORed against row . The fourth pivot row is found in row , column , and is XORed against row . The fifth pivot row is found in row , column , and is XORed against row . At this point, there are no remaining nonzero elements in rows  and . The matrix has been converted to echelon format, and the rank may be identified by determining the number of nonzero rows, in this case, . Accordingly, the matrix has rank , less than n, and the hash key is a \u201cbad\u201d key.","Referring now to the example shown in , the flow distributor may receive a second hash key and again convert the key to binary, and create a matrix in the same method as shown in . Here, the first nonzero element in the first pivot column is in row , column . Row  and row  are flipped, so that row  is the first pivot row. This first pivot row is then XORed against row , the only other row with a nonzero element in column . Note that it is possible to have a column, such as column  with no nonzero elements. For example, if the bit string shown here started with seven zeros instead of five, there would be no nonzero element anywhere in the first pivot column. As discussed above, the pivot column would be incremented by one, and the flow distributor would find the first nonzero element in row two, still starting from row one.","Still referring to , having found the first pivot row and transformed the first pivot column, the flow distributor continues by finding the first nonzero element in the next pivot column, starting in the next row. In this example, the element is at row , column . Accordingly, row  is flipped with row , so that row  is the second pivot row. There are no nonzero elements in column  below row , so there no XOR operations are performed.","The third pivot element is found at row , column . Row  is flipped with row , and XORed against row  as shown. The fourth pivot element is found at row , column , already in the pivot position, so the row is not flipped. However, row  contains a nonzero element so row  is XORed against row  as shown. Similarly, the fifth pivot row, row , is already in position and is XORed against row  as shown. Finally, the sixth and seventh pivot rows are already in position, and no further elementary row operations need be performed. Again, the rank may be identified by determining the number of nonzero rows, in this case, seven. Accordingly, the matrix has rank seven, equal to the number of rows, and therefore the hash key is a \u201cgood\u201d key for use in this combination of tuple, key length, and bit mask.","While various embodiments of the methods and systems have been described, these embodiments are exemplary and in no way limit the scope of the described methods or systems. Those having skill in the relevant art can effect changes to form and details of the described methods and systems without departing from the broadest scope of the described methods and systems.
