{"@attributes":{"id":"description"},"BRFSUM":[{},{}],"heading":["FIELD OF THE INVENTION","BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION","SUMMARY OF THE INVENTION","DETAILED DESCRIPTION OF THE DRAWINGS"],"p":["The present invention relates to a method, system and message structure for electronically exchanging medical information. In particular, the invention relates to a method, system and message structure for exchanging electronic medical records between medical record management systems each storing records that are coded according to disparate coding systems. It is also a suitable form of representation of patient health data in the life cycle of patient medical records.","In this specification, where a document, act or item of knowledge is referred to or discussed, this reference is not an admission that the document, act or item or knowledge or any combination thereof was at the priority date:\n\n","The creation of a medical record for a patient is an essential aspect of medical treatment. As known by those skilled in the art, records typically include a variety of information such as doctor and nursing notes regarding the patient's complaints and symptoms, diagnoses, treatments and procedures administered, allergies, medicines the patient has been taking, medicines that are newly prescribed as well as patient demographic information.","Medical records allow physicians who treat a patient in the future to gain background regarding the patient's condition, in a continual process of storytelling and retelling that sometimes extends over a patient's entire lifetime.","Many attempts have been made to create a standardised nomenclature for diagnoses, treatments, medical procedures, medications, and other medical services for inclusion in medical records. One system is the International Classification of Diseases (ICD), which is a classification structure that provides rules for assigning numeric codes that specify diseases, injuries, the causes of these, medical findings, and other factors affecting patient care, as well as codes for surgical, diagnostic, and therapeutic procedures. Other classification systems include the Systemized Nomenclature of Medicine Clinical Terms (SNOMED CT)\u2014which provides detailed and specific classification codes for clinical information and reference terminology, the Logical Observation Identifiers Names and Codes (LOINC)\u2014for identifying laboratory observations\u2014and the International Classification of Primary Care (ICPC).","The move from paper-based to fully electronic medical records has been underway for a number of years and there are many electronic medical record administration systems available. An intractable problem with these systems, however, is a lack of interoperability, being the ability of two or more systems or components to exchange information and to use the information that has been exchanged as defined by IEEE 90.","Of course, interoperability would be less of an issue if all medical data was coded into medical records using a common coding system and utilisation of a common medical record architecture, in the same manner as an ASCII file for the exchange of text. This however, is an unrealistic goal, at least at the present time. In order to ameliorate difficulties arising from the lack of interoperability, maps have been established to allow for data conversion directly from one coding system into another. In addition \u2018health message protocols\u2019, such as HL7 or PIT, allow for the communication of portions of medical records from one system to another by specifying the coding system in a field of the communicated data structure, with other fields of the structure populated with the requisite medical codes. Of course, the data must still be converted into the native coding system of the recipient system by utilising a conversion map (as referred to above) before it can be processed by the recipient system.","High level conversion maps are not perfect because of, amongst other things, the differing meanings captured by the codes of each system, and also because of a lack of equivalent codes between systems. This less than perfect mapping between coding systems can result in information being lost during the process of conversion. It is thus an object of the present invention to allow the exchange of medical records between systems using differing coding systems and record architectures, that reduces the likelihood of information loss occuring.","According to a first aspect of the present invention there is provided a message structure for electronically exchanging medical information between applications utilising disparate medical coding systems and record architectures, the message structure comprising an optional storyline keyword that sets the context for one or more subsequent statements, each of which statements comprise:\n\n","The present invention takes a different approach to that of the prior art, in that it does not attempt to provide a map directly from one coding system into another. Instead, the invention provides a message structure into which coded medical records may be easily converted for electronic exchange and conversion into another (possibly different) coded format. The non-reliance on any particular medical data coding systems will be referred to as \u201clate binding\u201d, throughout this specification.","It will be noted that the statements of the present invention are structured as a genre-subject-predicate tuple, which is essentially a hybridized form of natural language studded with computer keywords. Indeed, medical data encoded in the statements of the present invention are quite readable by humans, as the message structure has the look and feel of natural language. Moreover, the \u201cnatural language\u201d basis of the statements allows for very efficient conversion from a great many coding systems, because of the fact that coded electronic medical records have often been created from original \u2018natural language\u2019 records.","The recursive nature of the statements of the present invention (in that both a subject or a predicate may itself contain a nested statement) allow even very complex medical data to be encoded into the message structure.","The natural language basis of the structure also allows for new coding systems to be taken into account as and when they are developed.","Typically, the genre is either a medical information message or an administrative information message. Administrative messages are used for the exchange of data such as names, addresses, dates of birth and such.","Medical information messages are used to convey items of medical information and data such as: \u201cagency\u201d \u201creason for encounter\u201d \u201chistory\u201d \u201cphysical examination\u201d \u201cpresentation\u201d \u201cdiagnosis\u201d \u201cdiagnosis+\u201d \u201cdiagnosis\u02dc\u201d \u201cdiagnosis\u2212\u201d \u201cadverse drug reaction\u201d \u201callgergy\u201d \u201ckeep in view\u201d \u201crisk\u201d \u201cwarning\u201d \u201cpast history\u201d \u201cfamily history\u201d \u201csocial history\u201d \u201cinvestigation\u201d \u201coutcome\u201d \u201cgoal\u201d \u201cplan\u201d \u201ctreatment\u201d \u201cno\u201d \u201cadministration\u201d \u201c?\u201d \u201cmemorandum\u201d \u201cmix\u201d \u201cproblem\u201d \u201cimmunization\u201d \u201cevaluation\u201d.","The optional context joiner (notated as contextJoiner) that follows the subject is a conjunctive keyword stigmatised with a colon character :. The context joiner with its adjoining natural language parameter is read together to form a predicate. One or more of these predicates working in unison further enhances the meaning and precision of the message by describing the subject. The context joiner is typically either a location descriptor, a temporal descriptor, a noun descriptor, a grammatical descriptor, an imperative descriptor or a logical descriptor.","Examples of context joiners that are location descriptors include: \u201cabout:\u201d, \u201cabove:\u201d, \u201cacross:\u201d, \u201caheadOf:\u201d, \u201calong:\u201d, \u201camong:\u201d, \u201cassociated:\u201d, \u201cat:\u201d, \u201cbehind:\u201d, \u201cbelow:\u201d, \u201cbeside:\u201d, \u201cbetween:\u201d, \u201cin:\u201d, \u201cin FrontOf:\u201d, \u201cinto:\u201d, \u201cnear:\u201d, \u201cnextTo:\u201d, \u201con:\u201d, \u201conto:\u201d, \u201cover:\u201d, \u201ctoward:\u201d, of \u201cunder:\u201d.","Examples of context joiners that are temporal descriptors include: \u201cbefore:\u201d, \u201cafter:\u201d, \u201cduring:\u201d, \u201cfrom:\u201d, \u201csince:\u201d, \u201cthroughout:\u201d, \u201cwhile:\u201d, \u201cuntil:\u201d, \u201cfor:\u201d or \u201cwhen:\u201d.","Examples of context joiners that are noun descriptors include: \u201ccomplications:\u201d, \u201cdose:\u201d, \u201cfact:\u201d, \u201cfrequency:\u201d, \u201cunit:\u201d.","Examples of context joiners that are imperative descriptors include: \u201cask:\u201d, \u201cfind:\u201d, \u201cgo:\u201d, \u201cmore:\u201d, \u201cno:\u201d, \u201cnote:\u201d, \u201cstop:\u201d, \u201cstart:\u201d.","Examples of context joiners that are logical descriptors are terms such as \u201cbecause:\u201d, \u201cthen:\u201d, \u201celse:\u201d and \u201cif:\u201d.","According to a second aspect of the present invention, interoperability in healthcare is achieved by the production and consumption of messages disclosed in the first aspect of the invention. More particularly, there is provided a method for exchanging medical information between an originating application and a recipient application, the method comprising the steps of:\n\n","The intermediate unitary health language may comprise Doclescript.","The present invention is not limited to use with any particular coding system and may, for example, be used to exchange medical data between systems employing such as ICD, Docle, Read, ICPC, LOINC, or Snomed. An intermediate unitary health language such as Doclescript is useful as a \u201cbridging\u201d coding solution, as it has the expressivity and range of a natural language.","According to a third aspect of the present invention, there is provided a system for electronically exchanging medical information, comprising:\n\n","Turning to , a system  and method for exchanging health information is illustrated. Electronic medical record application systems A & B are installed and operate on separate computing platforms that are linked via a communications network . Each system A & B incorporates an application program and accesses a database (not shown) of electronic medical records that are encoded according to one of the known coding systems. For example, application A may be installed in a hospital in the United States and accesses records encoded according to the ICD classification, whereas application B may run at an Australian GP's office and accesses records encoded according to the ICPC classification.","In the event that application B requires a copy of a record that is accessible to application A, application B requests a copy through the communications network . On receipt of the request, application A extracts the record from the database and applies a conversion to it, either: through a direct route of writing out the message in Simple Health Electronic Exchange Protocol (SHEEP\u2014see below), which can be a relatively staightforward task as each ICD numeric code has a natural language descriptor which can be used to populate the blank SHEEP messages; or through an indirect route by utilising a suitable parsing program for conversion into an Intermediate Health Language (such as Doclescript), from which it may be converted to a SHEEP.","Doclescript and its uses are more fully described in published specifications WO 97\/48059, WO 98\/44432, WO 00\/14652, WO 01\/39037 and WO 03\/034274, which publications are incorporated herein by reference.","From the Intermediate Unitary Health Language , the data comprised in the record is converted into one or more messages  having a structure that is described in further detail below. Throughout this specification, this message structure will be referred to as Simple Health Electronic Exchange Protocol or SHEEP.","The SHEEP messages are then passed to the physical layer , where they are packed into data transport packages according to the protocols of the communications network . A similar physical layer  is present at the system B that accepts data packets from the communications network , and passes them up to the SHEEP layer  where the original SHEEP messages are extracted. As described in further detail below, SHEEP is a substantially natural language based protocol and is quite readable in its native format.","In turn, the SHEEP messages are passed up to the Intermediate Health Language layer  and then, after conversion to the coding system utilised by system B, into the electronic medical records application for processing and use. Alternately a parser can be constructed to parse SHEEP message directly from  to B as the natural language segments are very short (typically one to four words) and the context is fixed.","Turning to , the structure of a health information message  (or SHEEP message) is described in greater detail. The message , is made up of a genre , followed by a subject , followed by a predicate . As will be realized from below, the predicate is an optional component of the message.","The genre  is a broad description of the \u2018type\u2019 or \u2018category\u2019 of the message. The values  of the genre type are chosen from a list, which is described in further detail below.","The subject  identifies the \u201centity\u201d that is the subject of the message, which is either a string of text, or a recursively defined message (ie. a genre-subject-predicate).","The predicate  communicates a relationship, conjunction or link between the genre and subject and its values  are also are selected from a list  of possible ContextJoiners, as described below, followed by zero or more recursively defined messages.","The full syntax for SHEEP messages is defined in Extended Backus Naur Form below.","Put another way, the following steps to output health data in SHEEP format, the word pragma means a keyword switch to guide the compiler:\n\n","The following steps are utilized to process the input of health data in SHEEP format:\n\n","There is a systemic interoperability taxonomy to define the level of interoperability in medical informatics:\n\n","This invention bypasses the above two steps. This invention obviates the need to maintain maps of one medical coding system to another medical coding system. This invention obviates the need to use a medical coding system for medical messaging as the message content is pure medical English or equivalent natural language of German or French. This invention called SHEEP for simple health electronic exchange protocol\u2014uses a message construct that is composed of natural medical language and dynamic computer language components. SHEEP works because each medical coding system has a natural language specification of its code. SHEEP works because it defers binding to the medical codes in its embodiment. A general practitioner system that uses the Docle or ICPC coding system, can output a summary of a patient file in SHEEP message format. This patient summary in SHEEP format, which is in quite readable English state, can be imported into a hospital record system that uses ICD10Am by parsing the SHEEP message into ICD10Am using a direct parser or a Doclescript parser as a bridge. This late-binding health message structure of SHEEP is compatible with all existing and future medical coding systems as there is no specification of the medical coding used in the SHEEP message per se. SHEEP will also find green pasture incorporating new medical terminology as they are invented.","For a medical message to be sent, a medical message has to be composed according to the strict syntax of the messaging format. This message held in a medical messaging format is then packaged inside a secure email or secure electronic link to be sent to the receiver. In prior art systems, these messages are placed in a computer folder. The receiving end then needs to pick up the message held as a computer file from the computer folder, parse the medical message to extract the contents of the message to be inserted into the client medical record. The problem with prior art systems is that there is a messaging standard for pathology, there is a messaging standard for radiology, a messaging standard for patient hospital discharge to the doctor etc . This proliferation of messaging standards and for each medical subdomain creates confusion. For example, pathology laboratories use LOINC codes, general practitioners use Docle codes, while hospital discharge summaries use the ICD9 and ICD10 codes. The Tower of babel scenario where there is a proliferation of medical messaging formats using a plurality of coding systems is reality. While the holy grail appears to be a universal health messaging format utilising a universal health language, this has been merely a tantalizing goal. For that reason, medical connectivity is not happening as it should in 2004\/2005. Patient healthcare is being compromised.","This invention is a unitary health messaging system to allow for data-interchange and interoperability amongst a plurality of clinical systems utilising a plurality of health coding systems and a plurality of electronic health record architectures. It does so by leveraging on the fourth layer of a new clinical information model comprising seven layers.","This fourth layer, also known as the Simple Health Electronic Exchange Protocol, is a representational system for a medical proposition comprising a hybrid of formal computer syntax segments and natural language segments.","This health messaging invention can be viewed best by looking at this 7 layered Docle health language reference model","The Generic Medical Proposition Theory","The generic medical proposition (GMP) theory states that a solution to the medical coding and communication conundrum in a connected health environment exists when and only when we can code for any medical proposition. The basis for this theory is that healthcare is storytelling and retelling. The basis for any story telling is the sentence or proposition.","The Docle Health Language Model","A seven layer health language model is proposed for the computer capture, representation and transmission of the medical experience that spans both intensional and extensional data. The layers are created with the following criteria: 1) the need for a different abstraction to suit a practical need 2) each layer has a different functional role from the programmatic viewpoint 3) the creation of a level to suit international protocols such as the SQL standard and the English language 4) the layers are clearly distinct and demarcated with its own dedicated syntax and grammar 5) layer boundary conditions are chosen so that information in one layer can be translated up or down, or even directly across several layers with minimal or no loss of information. The model is based on the generic medical proposition (GMP) theory which states that a solution to the medical coding and communication conundrum exists when we can code for any medical proposition.","The seven layers of the Docle health language model is described below. Analysis is given of the proximity or distance of each language level from the two endpoints of the communication chasm. This two endpoints being the mind of the human and the mind of the machine.","Late and Early Bindings of Machine Representation of Data.","A medical message is said to have \u201cearly binding\u201d to the machine's representation of health data when actual coded health data (in say Docle, Snomed or ICPC) is sent in the message body. An alternative strategy is to send \u201clate binding\u201d data elements that act as proxies for the intended data send. This late binding and the use of natural language expressions as proxies for the actual message load is one of the essential components of SHEEP.","The advantages of the present invention, then, relate primarily to two related features:\n\n","As discussed above, the problem of post-coordination in medical coding has been recognized for some time. Without efficient and effective post-coordination, a system is likely to require millions of separate codes for healthcare \u2018story telling\u2019.","With this in mind, the inventor has compared and contrasted Snomed CT with Docle. Docle is able comprise an endless number of codes by using combinations from a base palette of only around 20,000 atomic concepts. These atomic concepts are joined together in a process of de novo pro re nata synthesis to create molecular concepts, and this process is referred to as post-coordination.","Another way to view this process of post-coordination is to view a code for a single medical concept such as \u201cmanic depressive illness\u201d as a gem. We are now able to cut \u2018facets\u2019 onto this gem to create variants. Amongst the facets applicable for \u201cmanic-depressive illness\u201d might be, for example, the presence or absence of a past history or family history. Other facets might be the context and complex scenarios such as associating a treatment for manic-depressive illness and its outcome in the patient. The relevant Docle genus is referred to as moodDisorder^(moodd^), which has 27 species. Using the base palette of 27 concepts, we derive at least 324 useful depression codes with a plurality of retrievable and searchable facets by splicing the codes.","The Seven Layers of the Docle Health Language Model",{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0057","num":"0000"},"ul":{"@attributes":{"id":"ul0016","list-style":"none"},"li":["1. there is a neurophysiological\/mind state of the user that correlates with the meaning of a proposition. This is equivalent to the neurological correlate of consciousness (NCC) of Francis Crick. In mind research, Marvin Minsky call them K-lines. Medical coding activity may in the future spring from electrodes attached to the scalp. An embodiment of this layer would be a specific pattern of EEG waves. In mind research, we can examine 2 K-lines that represent the propositions: 1) \u201cLet's try gliclazide for this patient's diabetes mellitus\u201d and 2) \u201cThis patient has abnormal liver function tests\u201d.","2. the formal natural language layer as expressed in English, using same two examples: \u201cI want to prescribe gliclazide for diabetes mellitus\u201d and \u201cThe serum liver function test shows findings of abnormal elevated enzymes\u201d.","3. the informal doctor talk or Docletalk layer which captures the above 2 propositions with a minimal of keystrokes. It is terse, it will reflect regional idiosyncracies, it is doctor shorthand. It is not suited for data interoperability as it is too cryptic and fuzzy. It is suited for use as input data at the doctor desktop on the premise that the intended communicative value of the data input is reflected back to the user for confirmation:\n    \n    ","4. The Simple Health Electronic Exchange Protocol layer (SHEEP) is the health data interoperable format. It is useful for representing the actual health message and the transport of partial and complete electronic medical records with syntactic and semantic interoperability amongst a plurality of computerized medical record systems using the same or different combinations of healthcare coding systems and health record architectures. It is a human and machine readable health domain natural language format that reads like English. SHEEP is defined in Extended Backus Naur Form; the SHEEP format is a) independent from both healthcare codes and electronic health record architectures, b) comprised of natural language expressions and natural language pragmas that act as keyword switches for the compiler. This layer is the basis of a unitary health messaging standard that transcends any formal health coding system. The two example propositions above are represented as\n    \n    ","[sh language smalltalk","stub Dialog warn:\u2018hello world\u2019","sh]\n\nis the SHEEP equivalent of the hello world program as the stub pragma tells the interpreter\/compiler to invoke\/perform the action of sending the method \u201cwarn\u201d with parameter \u201chello world\u201d to the Dialog object.\n"]}},"Note that there is structure. The paired square parentheses enclose one or more medical propositions.","The rx represents the treatment genre.","The \u201cliver function test\u201d is the subject. It is bounded by the genre and the conjunctive modifier find:. The subject is in natural language, in this instance Medical English. In the German version of SHEEP, it would of course be in German.","The context joiner or conjunctive modifier \u201cfind:\u201d has a colon character, this is the stigma of all conjunctive modifiers.","The parameter that comes after the context joiner is in natural language, in this instance in Medical English\u2014\u201cabnormal\u201d.","So each SHEEP statement represents a medical proposition. The SHEEP message is enclosed in square parentheses\u2014[sh and sh]. It has an optional storyline e.g. \u201cpatient summary\u201d or \u201cconsultation\u201d. It has a genre, it has a subject and it has one or more joiner modifier with its parameter(s).","Another useful role of SHEEP is that of a universal medical API or application programming interface. An API is a set of definitions of the ways a computer application communicates with another computer application. It is a method of achieving commonality of abstraction level by the two communicating computer applications moving up or down its respective levels. At this SHEEP level, there is no binding to any formal health coding systems such as Snomed, ICPC, ICD9, ICD10 or Docle. Because there is no binding yet to any formal coding system, we can term SHEEP as a late binding health application programming interface(API). API saves work all round in that it provides \u201cblack box\u201d functionality in allowing reference calls to the black box and in the implementation or re-implementation of such a \u201cblack box\u201d API as a web service or software development kit without the breaking of the caller program. For messaging between two electronic health record architectures\u2014the SHEEP propositions can be embedded in standard PIT and HL7 messages as a mixing component. The 3 fair assumptions being that 1) both ends talk English and messages are immediately useful 2) both ends can easily export messages in SHEEP as it is no harder than exporting a word processed document 3) SHEEP can be interpreted into an intermediate unitary health language such as Doclescript or equivalent representational system.\n\n","This is also referred to as the intermediate unitary health language (IUHL), it is a coded form of the propositions. For messaging between two electronic health record architectures\u2014the Doclescript propositions can be embedded in standard PIT and HL7 messages as a mixing component on the optimistic assumption that both ends talk Doclescript.\n\n","An effective health communication strategy is to look at the status quo of the health IT landscape with its plurality of medical record architectures\/software platforms and divergent medical coding systems. With reference to the language model above, it is possible achieve level 4 interoperability in healthcare messaging utilising any one or more layers of 1) SHEEP layer 2) Doclescript layer or 3) EHRBUS layer. This invention seeks to solve the current health communication problems of multi-record architectures, multi-health coding environments by not interfering with the users ultimate choice of health coding representational system and its idiosyncratic record architecture\/software platform. By taking this stance, it is future proofing this health messaging system and it is not locked onto any existing or yet-to-be-invented health coding system. This late binding approach is suited for an environment when we are still groping for a unified health language. In the scenario where everyone uses the same or similar word based health coding system then layers 5 (Doclescript\u2014where there is early binding) or 6 (ehrbus\u2014where there is pre-emptive binding in the sense that the sender of the message knows about the SQL tabular data structure to insert the data) would be ideal for health messaging.","The author initially looked at attacking the problem at another location in the communication chain. The choice location being the computer memory that represents the correlate of medical messaging. The example below clarifies this point.","It is conjectural and plausible that the states of mind of a French, German, Chinese, Japanese, Korean or English speaking physician reading a patient summary with a sentence, in their respective languages, such as \u201cThis patient has carcinoma of the lung associated with 40 year history of heavy cigarette consumption\u201d\u2014will evoke very similar firing of patterns of neuronal activity at roughly the same brain loci. This pattern of neuronal activity in the brain can be said to be the neurological correlates of the sentence. It is postulated that there is an underlying neuronal pattern language in healthcare that is at its substratum layer that is common to healthcare expressed in any language . . . be it French, German, Chinese, Japanese, Korean or English. This is backed up by the experiments of neurologist William Penfold, who electrically stimulated different areas of the brain of a patient to evoke intense experiences in the patient. Artists have the knack for expressing timeless truths as evidenced by the quote by songwriter Jesse Harris \u201cOne flight down\u201d sung by Norah Jones\u2014\u201cOne flight down, there's a song on low. And it's been there playing all along. Now you know. Now you know.\u201d This invention of messaging with SHEEP recognizes that there is this \u201csong on low\u201d, that is one flight down from SHEEP there is Doclescript. Another flight down from Doclescript there is EHRBUS. So in effect there are two lower \u201croads\u201d in the medical messaging worlds below SHEEP\u2014the \u201chigh road\u201d SHEEP can be mixed in with the traditional health messaging protocols such as PIT and HL7. When the SHEEP road is more travelled, then the less travelled road of Doclescript and EHRBUS may be explored. At the lowest of the \u201clow roads\u201d where medical messaging is reduced to exchanging gestalts between the memories of two computer systems using EHRBUS.","EHRBUS","In a previous invention by the inventor, a unified table structure for patient transactions were posited\u2014and transportability was achieved by sending Doclescript health messages or Doclescript messages encased in PIT or HL7. In prior art, these propositions expressed in Doclescript was parsed and posted to the end user medical record system. In the prior art the users of Doclescript would need a Doclescript parser to parse the Doclescript messages. Whereas in this invention it obviates the need for the user to parse Doclescript as it is already \u201cpre-digested\u201d. One way of clarifying this EHRBUS way is to use the \u201cExperiencing tasting of ice-cream example\u201d. Tasting of the ice-cream can be effected by actually ingesting the ice cream. The cold sensation in the mouth and associated anatomical structures, the stimulation of the taste and smell receptors create a neurological correlate of consciousness in the brain that equates to \u201ctasting the ice cream\u201d. Supposing we have a precise map of the neurological correlates of \u201ctasting the ice cream\u201d and the resources to recreate this map of the neurological correlates of consciousness in the brain\u2014we do not need real physical ice cream to evoke the \u201ctasting the ice cream\u201d experience if we can get to the end of the messaging chain directly by whatever means.

Medical messaging by exchanging gestalts posits a \u201cstart\u201d and an \u201cend\u201d point which are correlates of medical messaging which are represented by read\/write access to a time-stamped series of repeated pre-designated named memory locations and meaning switches in each of the user's computer; whereby an instance of such a series represents a medical message and each of the named memory locations of such an instance has a specific contextual meaning that is contingent upon the values of a generic meaning switch and\/or specific meaning switches, generating a message amenable to computer algorithm processing to derive canonical clinical codes, and a message that is a gestalt of the a) meaning of the named locations, b) the values in said named locations and c) the values of the meaning switches; and contained in any one instance of the series, a meta-message pertaining to the medical message, which is stored in a pre-designated named location; this meta-message informs the receiver about the recommended course of action to be taken about said medical message, and is expressed as programmatic method stubs and their parameters to provide the linkage for execution by the receiver of its own versions of such programmatic methods on specified parameters.","The Problem of Health Messaging","Healthcare is storytelling and retelling. Messages need to be passed amongst providers of health care and the patients themselves for collaborative problem solving over a time line that may exceed a couple of decades. Hitherto messages written in English held in paper records suffice, but not so in the computer era where there is a proliferation of data often held in computer databases. There exists also the tantalising prospect that the machine can help the medical care process itself with timely machine decision support. This is particularly true in the era of patient held electronic health records in the background of increased patient awareness and participation in their own health management. To derive maximum benefit from computerised health messaging, these health messages need to be in a structured and coded format to make them computer readable and amenable to computer processing. Health connectivity is dependent on sending and receiving of medical messages. Currently these medical messages are sent in HL7 (health language 7) or PIT formats. Typically prior art systems depend heavily on marked up languages like SGML\/XML.","For a medical message to be sent, a medical message has to be composed according to the strict syntax of the messaging format. This message held in a medical messaging format is then packaged inside a secure email or secure electronic link to be sent to the receiver. In prior art systems, these messages are placed in a computer folder. The receiving end then needs to pick up the message held as a computer file from the computer folder, parse the medical message to extract the contents of the message to be inserted into the client medical record. The problem with prior art systems is that there is a messaging standard for pathology, there is a messaging standard for radiology, a messaging standard for patient hospital discharge to the doctor etc . This proliferation of messaging standards and for each medical subdomain creates confusion. For example, pathology laboratories use LOINC codes, general practitioners use Docle codes, while hospital discharge summaries use the ICD9 and ICD10 codes. The Tower of babel scenario where there is a proliferation of medical messaging formats using a plurality of coding systems is reality. While the holy grail appears to be a universal health messaging format utilising a universal health language, this is merely a tantalising goal. For that reason, medical connectivity is not happening as it should in 2004\/2005. Patient healthcare is being compromised.","Processing and Storing SHEEP Messages","The SHEEP invention alleviates the health messaging problem in all its aspects of the invention described. SHEEP also paves the way for deeper and more efficient way for two computer systems to communicate, in particular the delights of communicating at the EHRBUS(COMM) level is discussed. The preferred embodiment of processing and storing SHEEP messages is their conversion to doclscript and then held in SQL tables of the COMM type(Correlate of Medical Messaging). COMM represents the common denominator end of the medical messaging chain. System vendors of medical software can feed of COMM using SQL query language. The target goal is to create an instance of COMM for each medical message received. With the SHEEP framework, COMM SQL tables is the natural fit for storing the parsed message in COMM (EHRBUS) format. Messaging can be effected by direct manipulation at the COMM level. For security purposes, any data inserted or changes to the COMM tables has to be effected by programs sanctioned and stored on the machine at the receiving end of the messaging\u2014see PHP program example. In this example the php script resides on the receiving end. This script is invoked by an outside php script and passes the SQL instruction as a parameter. Similarly in another embodiment, a web service on the client side, a SOAP or XMLRPC service can be invoked to update the COMM. In summary the centurion guards are actually programs that reside on the receiver side; this guards the sanctity of the data. In one embodiment, a SHEEP medical message is received, it is parsed into Doclescript, this is then parsed into a Sql statement that caused a row to be added to a COMM arrival table. The quickest way to achieve an addition of a row to the COMM table is through communication of an industry standard SQL statement. In this post SHEEP processing, one good endpoint of medical communication is effected by inserting\/updating of a COMM table. Practice with SHEEP messages makes likely future medical messaging based on Doclescript or mere exchange of SQL statements to update COMM tables at both ends.","Any system and method of medical messaging is based on a system where there is total elimination of the medical messaging format layer may have to wait. Medical messaging that is attained by creating changes termed COMM (correlate of medical message) in the computer system is demonstrated in the following pages. Typically, this correlate of medical message (COMM is represented by a row in a unified structured query language (SQL) table. This correlate of medical message (COMM) is the possible ideal outcome if a medical message had been sent in a pre-agreed medical message format and its contents parsed and data posted. A preferred embodiment of this invention has each node in a messaging network a 1) SEND correlate of medical message (SEND COMM) and a 2) RECEIVE correlate of medical message (RECEIVE COMM). COMM (correlate of medical message) is structured for direct query by client applications and hence ready for immediate inter-operability by client systems. This system obviates the complexity of assembly of and sending of such a medical message in any given medical messaging format. This system obviates the complexity of receiving, parsing and posting of data of such a medical message received in any medical messaging format.","In one embodiment of COMM(EHRBUS) communication there exists a http server, sql service and a server side scripting language like PHP or Microsoft ASP or even a WEB service like soap or XMLRPC.","A poor man's implementation of COMM is just a SQL service with the COMM tables.","A poorer man's implementation of his medical record is a SQL dump of his COMM tables, this serves as his medical record backup.","COMM is converting a medical messaging

Ideally, such a code will be derived from Doclescript propositions.","A SHEEP message is passed through a SHEEP Parser to derive Doclescript proposition(s), which are then fed to a post-cordination algorithm to derive canonical standalone codes that captures the entire meaning of the proposition(s).","This section deals with the algorithmic derivation of canonical standalone codes from a Docle script propositions. Such canonical codes are termed Docle codes. Such standalone codes are used in clinical systems for matching\/retrieval and in clinical decision support. How can we leverage a natural language \u201cfront\u201d like SHEEP into a post-coordinated medical coding system? A post-coordinated medical coding system (e.g. Docle) has typically a base of 10,000 to 20,000 coded concepts; such a system has a syntax and grammar that allows the formation of billions of combinations of base concepts (post-coordination) to unleash unlimited expression\/expressivity of clinical scenarios and yet generate codes that are amenable to computer searching, matching, comparison, analysis and retrieval. An algorithmic method is disclosed to arrive at standalone codes, starting from a natural language message such as SHEEP. Generating canonical standalone codes is akin to the concept of reduction in chemistry or refactoring in mathematics.","From SHEEP to Standalone Canonical Forms:","An example is to code for \u201cplantar wart treated with cryotherapy\u201d.","The SHEEP message is: [sh rx cryoTherapy for:plantar wart with: sh]","After being parsed to Doclescript: &ctx@rx[ppoc@cryoTherapy],for[wart@plan-tar]","The post-coordinator algorithm converts the above Doclescript to the standalone canonical codes:\n\n","In general, then, the conversion of Docle script propositions to canonical standalone codes comprises the following steps:\n\n","Referring to the algorithm above, we start with a Docle script statement that concerns a patient's weight loss for 2 months: &ctx@hxpx[weight@loss],for[2\/12]","The Docle abbreviating algorithm will produce:&ctxhxpx[weig@loss],for[2\/12], giving the following canonical forms:\n\n","The construction of such standalone codes with the subject (the thematic concept) as the leading term and separator characters of colon form : allows for easy splicing and dicing of codes for in depth analysism, searching and processing.","Turning to the reverse process, the unpacking of canonical standalone codes to SHEEP messages using a reversed post-coordination algorithm:","The canonical standalone codes (an example is weig@loss:hxpx,for:2\/12) contain the germ for ready regeneration back to a SHEEP message.","The algorithm comprises the steps of:\n\n","As an example, referring to the algorithm above, we start with a standalone canonical code (representing \u2018weight loss for 2 months\u2019) of weig@loss:hxpx,for:2\/12, giving the following Sheep form:\n\n","The reverse post-coordination algorithm means that medical coding and messaging are seamlessly connected in the following linguistic stack: Sheep->doclescript->canonical standalone code.

It is based on primary and secondary keys, such as \u201cdiabetesMellitus\u201d, which maps to a secondary Docle code (\u201cdiabm\u201d) using an abbreviating Docle algorithm. The Docle algorithm returns the first four characters for a single word source, and for a two-word source, returns the first four characters of the first word concatenated to the first character of second word. For three or more word sources, it returns the first character of each word concatenated together.
