{"@attributes":{"id":"description"},"BRFSUM":[{},{}],"heading":["BACKGROUND","INTRODUCTION","DESCRIPTION OF EXAMPLE EMBODIMENT(S)"],"p":["Mobile computing and communication devices, such as cellphones, PDAs, tablet computers, and mini-laptops have become prevalent in recent years. Such mobile devices are often tied to a specific individual and therefore contain personal information, including account information, user profile information, and pre-authorized and pre-authenticated access to Internet-connected applications with further access to personal, private, and confidential information. This may present a problem when a device owner or primary user of the device would like to temporarily allow another person to access or \u201ctry out\u201d the device and associated functions\u2014ideally, the other person would be able to try out the device and its functionality without having access to the primary user's personal information. In addition, while the other person is trying out the phone, they may enter their own personal information, to which they may not want to allow the primary user access.","The present disclosure relates generally to personal computing and communication devices associated with private information, and, more specifically, relates to shielding of private information on such a personal computing device in connection with temporary usage of the personal device.","The figures depict various embodiments of the present disclosure for purposes of illustration only. One skilled in the art will readily recognize from the following discussion that alternative embodiments of the structures and methods illustrated herein may be employed without departing from the principles of the invention described herein.","This disclosure is now described in detail with reference to a few embodiments thereof as illustrated in the accompanying drawings. In the following description, numerous specific details are set forth in order to provide a thorough understanding of this disclosure. However, this disclosure may be practiced without some or all of these specific details. In other instances, well known process steps and\/or structures have not been described in detail in order not to unnecessarily obscure this disclosure. In addition, while the disclosure is described in conjunction with the particular embodiments, it should be understood that this description is not intended to limit the disclosure to the described embodiments. To the contrary, the description is intended to cover alternatives, modifications, and equivalents as may be included within the spirit and scope of the disclosure as defined by the appended claims.","Overview","Particular embodiments relate to a social networking environment including a social networking system and related systems that include conventional stationary as well as mobile embodiments. A social networking system offers its users the ability to communicate and interact with other users of the social networking system. Users join the social networking system and then add connections to a number of other users to whom they desire to be connected. Once they are members of the social network, the users may interact with the social network itself, by viewing and posting images and video on their own page, or by using personal computing devices to view and post location-based social networking information.","In particular embodiments, a user may want to share their personal computing device with another user. Such an occasion may occur informally (e.g., a friend who lets a friend try out their device) or formally (e.g., trying out a device in a retail store). When the personal computing device utilizes software, e.g., an operating system and\/or applications, that relies upon personal information (including not only confidential information, but also any user-specific, user-entered, or user-generated information) to provide a personalized experience, the personal computing device may need to shield such personal information belonging to one user from being viewed or accessed by another user. This may include not only the situation where personal information is stored on the device itself, but also situations where certain applications and\/or the operating system have access to personal information stored remotely (e.g., email and communication applications, such as Gmail\u2122 or Twitter\u2122, social-networking applications, such as Facebook\u2122 or LinkedIn\u00ae, online banking and e-commerce applications, or content-sharing applications, such as YouTube\u2122 or Picasa\u2122).","In particular embodiments, a primary user of a personal computing device can protect their personal information by indicating that they are about to share their device with a temporary user (e.g., by clicking a button or selecting a menu option). In particular embodiments, the personal computing device may be able to detect that the primary user is holding or viewing the device by using biometric identification technology; in such embodiments, the device may also be able to detect when the primary user has let go of the device, or is no longer viewing the device, or when another user is holding or viewing the device.","In particular embodiments, when the primary user indicates, either passively or actively, that they are about to share the device with a temporary user or have just handed the device to a temporary user, the device may take one or more actions to protect personal information: (1) the device may remove or disable access to content, applications, information, or other data for which a user must be authenticated and\/or authorized (e.g., by logging out of a website, or by deleting cookies, or by disabling access to security certificates), (2) the device may remove or disable personal information stored on the device itself, and (3) the device may clear out any caches, logs, and\/or other sources of information that may track actions taken by or events that occurred with respect to the primary user.","In particular embodiments, the device enables the primary user to send an invitation with or without a secure authorization code to a potential temporary user, who is then able to log in to the device using information in the invitation. In particular embodiments, once the invitation has been sent, the device pre-loads information associated with the potential temporary user, so as to provide a personalized experience once the potential temporary user logs in to the device.","In particular embodiments, the device enables sharing with an anonymous temporary guest user. In particular embodiments, the device can be configured as a public device intended for use by multiple temporary users. In particular embodiments, for anonymous guest users and\/or for public use, the device displays a generic set of applications and content to allow such temporary users to \u201ctry out\u201d features and functionality of the device.",{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0019","num":"0018"},"figref":"FIG. 1","b":["100","100","110","120","130","110","110","110","110"]},"One or more links  couple a server  or a client  to network .

Sensors may provide various types of sensor data, which may be analyzed to determine the user's intention with respect to the mobile electronic device at a given time.","In particular embodiments, a sensors hub  may optionally be included in personal computing device . Sensors  may be connected to sensors hub , which may be a low power-consuming processor that controls sensors , manages power for sensors , processes sensor inputs, aggregates sensor data, and performs certain sensor functions. In addition, in particular embodiments, some types of sensors  may be connected to a controller . In this case, sensors hub  may be connected to controller , which in turn is connected to sensor . Alternatively, in particular embodiments, there may be a sensor monitor in place of sensors hub  for managing sensors .","In particular embodiments, in addition to the front side, personal computing device  may have one or more sensors for performing biometric identification. Such sensors may be positioned on any surface of personal computing device . In example embodiments, as the user's hand touches personal computing device  to grab hold of it, the touch sensors may capture the user's fingerprints or palm vein pattern. In example embodiments, while a user is viewing the screen of personal computing device , a camera may capture an image of the user's face to perform facial recognition. In example embodiments, while a user is viewing the screen of personal computing device , an infrared scanner may scan the user's iris and\/or retina. In example embodiments, while a user is in contact or close proximity with personal computing device , chemical and\/or olfactory sensors may capture relevant data about a user. In particular embodiments, upon detecting that there is a change in state with respect to the identity of the user utilizing personal computing device , either by itself or in combination with other types of sensor indications, personal computing device  may determine that it is being shared.","In particular embodiments, in addition to the front side, the personal computing device  may have touch sensors on the left and right sides. Optionally, the personal computing device  may also have touch sensors on the back, top, or bottom side. Thus, as the user's hand touches personal computing device  to grab hold of it, the touch sensors may detect the user's fingers or palm touching personal computing device . In particular embodiments, upon detecting that there is a change in state with respect to a user touching personal computing device , either by itself or in combination with other types of sensor indications, personal computing device  may determine that it is being shared.","In particular embodiments, personal computing device  may have an accelerometer in addition to or instead of the touch sensors on the left and right sides. Sensor data provided by the accelerometer may also be used to estimate whether a new user has picked up personal computing device  from a resting position, e.g., on a table or desk, display shelf, or from someone's hand or from within someone's bag. When the user picks up personal computing device  and brings it in front of the user's face, there may be a relatively sudden increase in the movement speed of personal computing device . This change in the device's movement speed may be detected based on the sensor data supplied by the accelerometer. In particular embodiments, upon detecting that there is a significant increase in the speed of the device's movement, either by itself or in combination with other types of sensor indications, personal computing device  may determine that it is being shared.","In particular embodiments, personal computing device  may have a Gyrometer in addition or instead of the touch sensors on the left and right sides. A Gyrometer, also known as a gyroscope, is a device for measuring the orientation along one or more axis. In particular embodiments, a Gyrometer may be used to measure the orientation of personal computing device . When personal computing device  is stored on a shelf or in the user's bag, it may stay mostly in one orientation. However, when the user grabs hold of personal computing device  and lifts it up and\/or moves it closer to bring it in front of the user's face, there may be a relatively sudden change in the orientation of personal computing device . The orientation of personal computing device  may be detected and measured by the gyrometer. If the orientation of personal computing device  has changed significantly, In particular embodiments, upon detecting that there is a significant change in the orientation of personal computing device , either by itself or in combination with other types of sensor indications, personal computing device  may determine that it is being shared.","In particular embodiments, personal computing device  may have a light sensor. When personal computing device  is stored in a user's pocket or case, it is relatively dark around personal computing device . On the other hand, when the user brings personal computing device  out of his pocket, it may be relatively bright around personal computing device , especially during day time or in well-lit areas. The sensor data supplied by the light sensor may be analyzed to detect when a significant change in the ambient light level around personal computing device  occurs. In particular embodiments, upon detecting that there is a significant increase in the ambient light level around personal computing device , either by itself or in combination with other types of sensor indications, personal computing device  may determine that it is being shared.","In particular embodiments, personal computing device  may have a proximity sensor. The sensor data supplied by the proximity sensor may be analyzed to detect when personal computing device  is in close proximity to a specific object, such as the user's hand. For example, mobile device  may have an infrared LED (light-emitting diode)  (i.e., proximity sensor) placed on its back side. When the user holds such a mobile device in his hand, the palm of the user's hand may cover infrared LED . As a result, infrared LED  may detect when the user's hand is in close proximity to mobile device . In particular embodiments, upon detecting that personal computing device  is in close proximity to the user's hand, either by itself or in combination with other types of sensor indications, personal computing device  may determine that it is being shared.","A personal computing device  may have any number of sensors of various types, and these sensors may supply different types of sensor data. Different combinations of the individual types of sensor data may be used together to detect and estimate a user's current intention with respect to personal computing device  (e.g., whether the user really means to take personal computing device  out of his pocket and use it). Sometimes, using multiple types of sensor data in combination may yield a more accurate, and thus better, estimation of the user's intention with respect to personal computing device  at a given time than only using a single type of sensor data. Nevertheless, it is possible to estimate the user's intention using a single type of sensor data (e.g., touch-sensor data).",{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0035","num":"0034"},"figref":["FIG. 2B","FIG. 2","FIG. 2"],"b":["200","200","200","280","200","200","280","280","200","280","280","200","280","280","280","280","280","280","270"]},"Of course, personal computing device  is merely an example. In practice, a device may have any number of sides, and this disclosure contemplates devices with any number of sides.

In particular embodiments, each screen or display of the user interface may be implemented as a web page. Thus, the device user may interact with the application through a series of screens or displays (i.e., a series of web pages). In particular embodiments, operating system  is Google's Android\u2122 mobile technology platform. With Android\u00ae, there is a Java\u00ae package called \u201candroid.webkit\u201d, which provides various tools for browsing the web. Among the \u201candroid.webkit\u201d package, there is a Java class called \u201candroid.webkit.WebView\u201d, which implements a View for displaying web pages. This class uses the WebKit rendering engine to display web pages and includes methods to navigate forward and backward through a history, zoom in, zoom out, perform text searches, and so on. In particular embodiments, an application user interface  may utilize Android's WebView application programming interface (API) to display each web page of the user interface in a View implemented by the \u201candroid.webkit.WebView\u201d class. Thus, in particular embodiments, software  may include any number of web views , each for displaying one or more web pages that implement the user interface of an application.","During the execution of an application, the device user may interact with the application through its user interface. For example, the user may provide inputs to the application in various displays (e.g., web pages). Outputs of the application may be presented to the user in various displays (e.g., web pages) as well. In particular embodiments, when the user provides an input to the application through a specific display (e.g., a specific web page), an event (e.g., an input event) may be generated by, for example, a web view  or application user interfaces . Each input event may be forwarded to application functions , or application functions  may listen for input events thus generated. When application functions  receive an input event, the appropriate software module in application functions  may be invoked to process the event. In addition, specific functionalities provided by operating system  and\/or hardware (e.g., as described in FIGS.  and A-B) may also be invoked. For example, if the event is generated as a result of the user pushing a button to take a photo with personal computing device , a corresponding image processing module may be invoked to convert the raw image data into an image file (e.g., JPG or GIF) and store the image file in the storage  of personal computing device . As anther example, if the event is generated as a result of the user selecting an icon to compose an instant message, the corresponding short message service (SMS) module may be invoked to enable the user to compose and send the message.","In particular embodiments, when an output of the application is ready to be presented to the user, an event (e.g., an output event) may be generated by, for example, a software module in application functions  or operating system . Each output event may be forwarded to application user interfaces , or application user interfaces  may listen for output events thus generated. When application user interfaces  receive an output event, it may construct a web view  to display a web page representing or containing the output. For example, in response to the user selecting an icon to compose an instant message, an output may be constructed that includes a text field that allows the user to input the message. This output may be presented to the user as a web page and displayed to the user in a web view  so that the user may type into the text field the message to be sent.","The user interface of an application may be implemented using a suitable programming language (e.g., HTML, JavaScript\u00ae, or Java\u00ae). More specifically, in particular embodiments, each web page that implements a screen or display of the user interface may be implemented using a suitable programming language. In particular embodiments, when a web view  is constructed to display a web page (e.g., by application user interfaces  in response to an output event), the code implementing the web page is loaded into web view .",{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0043","num":"0042"},"figref":["FIG. 4","FIG. 4"],"b":["400","400","405","410"]},"In particular embodiments, the primary user may be able to navigate through menus in the user interface (e.g., in the Device Settings menu) to activate shared mode.
