No. 61\/078,259 filed Jul. 3, 2008, entitled \u201cLIGHT BEAM PATTERN AND PHOTOVOLTAIC ELEMENTS LAYOUT,\u201d the entirety of which is incorporated herein by reference.","Limited supply and increasing demand of fossil energy resources and associated global environmental damage have driven global efforts to diversify utilization energy resources and related technologies. One such resource is solar energy, which employs photovoltaic (PV) technology for conversion of light into electricity. In addition, solar energy can be exploited for heat generation (e.g., in solar furnaces, steam generators, and the like). Solar technology is typically implemented in a series of PV cells, or solar cells, or panels thereof that receive sunlight and convert the sunlight into electricity, which can be subsequently delivered into a power grid. Significant progress has been achieved in design and production of solar panels, which has effectively increased efficiency while reducing manufacturing cost thereof. As more highly efficient solar cells are developed, size of the cell is decreasing leading to an increase in the practicality of employing solar panels to provide a competitive renewable energy substitute to dwindling and highly demanded non-renewable sources. To this end, solar energy collection systems like solar concentrators can be deployed to convert solar energy into electricity which can be delivered to power grids, and to harvest heat as well.","Parabolic reflectors are typically utilized to achieve light concentration. To produce electricity or heat, parabolic reflectors typically focus light into a focal area, or locus, which can be localized (e.g., a focal point) or extended (e.g., a focal line). Most reflector designs, however, posses substantial structural complexity that hinders mass producibility and ease of assembly of the design into a solar collector for energy conversion. Moreover, structural complexity generally complicates alignment of reflective elements (e.g., mirrors) as well as installation and maintenance or service of deployed concentrators.","The following presents a simplified summary in order to provide a basic understanding of some aspects described herein. This summary is not an extensive overview nor is intended to identify key\/critical elements or to delineate the scope of the various aspects described herein. Its sole purpose is to present some concepts in a simplified form as a prelude to the more detailed description that is presented later.","The subject innovation provides system(s) and method(s) for assembling and utilizing low-cost, mass producible parabolic reflectors in a solar concentrator for energy conversion. Parabolic reflectors can be assembled by starting with a flat reflective material that is bent into a parabolic or trough shape via a set of support ribs that are affixed in a support beam. The parabolic reflectors are mounted on a support frame in various panels or arrays to form a parabolic solar concentrator. Each parabolic reflector focuses light in a line segment pattern. Light beam pattern focused onto a receiver via the parabolic solar concentrator can be optimized to attain a predetermined performance. The receiver is attached to the support frame, opposite the parabolic reflector arrays, and includes a photovoltaic (PV) module and a heat harvesting element or component. To increase or retain a desired performance of the parabolic solar concentrator, the PV module can be configured, through adequate arrangement of PV cells that are monolithic, for example, and exhibit a preferential orientation, to advantageously exploit a light beam pattern optimization regardless of irregularities in the pattern.","To the accomplishment of the foregoing and related ends, certain illustrative aspects are described herein in connection with the following description and the annexed drawings. These aspects are indicative of various ways which can be practiced, all of which are intended to be covered herein. Other advantages and novel features may become apparent from the following detailed description when considered in conjunction with the drawings.","The subject innovation is now described with reference to the drawings, wherein like reference numerals are used to refer to like elements throughout.

One or more components may reside within a process and\/or thread of execution and a component may be localized on one computer and\/or distributed between two or more computers. Also, these components can execute from various computer readable media having various data structures stored thereon. The components may communicate via local and\/or remote processes such as in accordance with a signal having one or more data packets (e.g., data from one component interacting with another component in a local system, distributed system, and\/or across a network such as the Internet with other systems via the signal). As another example, a component can be an apparatus with specific functionality provided by mechanical parts operated by electric or electronic circuitry, which is operated by a software, or firmware application executed by a processor, wherein the processor can be internal or external to the apparatus and executes at least a part of the software or firmware application.

Reflective elements are reliable, inexpensive and readily available flat reflective materials (e.g., mirrors) that are deflected into a parabolic shape, or trough-shaped section, in a longitudinal direction and maintained flat in transversal direction to form a parabolic reflector. Therefore, reflector  focuses light on a focal line in a receiver . It should be appreciated that even though in example solar concentrator  a specific number (7) of reflectors  is illustrated, a larger or smaller number of reflectors can be employed in each panel -. Likewise, any substantial combination of reflector panels, or arrays,  and receivers  can be utilized in a solar concentrator as described in the subject specification. Such combination can include one or more receivers.","Additionally, it should be appreciated that reflectors  can be back coated with a protective element such as plastic foam or the like to facilitate integrity of the element when example solar concentrator  adopts a safety or service position (e.g., trough a rotation about main support beam ) and exposes the back of panel(s) 130, with 1=1, 2, 3, 4, under severe or adverse whether operation, for example.","It should be further appreciated that example solar collector  is a modular structure which can be readily mass produced, and transported piecewise and assembled on a deployment site. Moreover, the modular structure of panels  ensure a degree of operational redundancy that facilitated continued sunlight collection even in cases in which one or more reflectors become inoperable (e.g. reflector breaks, misaligns).","In an aspect of the subject innovation, receivers -in example concentrator  can include a photovoltaic (PV) module that facilitates energy conversion (light to electricity), and it can also harvest thermal energy (e.g., via a serpentine with a circulating fluid that absorbs heat created at the receivers) attached to the support structure of the PV module.

It should be appreciated that a set of N (a positive integer greater than three) support ribs can be employed to support reflective element . It is to be noted that support ribs can be manufactured with substantially any material with adequate rigidity to provide support and adjust to structural variations and environmental fluctuations. The number N and the material of support ribs (e.g., plastic, metal, carbon fiber) can be determined based at least in part on mechanical properties of reflective element , manufacture costs considerations, and so on.","Various techniques to attach support ribs (e.g., support ribs -) to backbone beam  can be utilized.

In an aspect of a VMJ solar cell, a set of N constituent solar cells is stacked along a growth direction Z , each constituent cell has a p-doping layer near a first interface of the cell with a disparate cell, and an n-doped layer near a second interface wherein the first and second interfaces are planes normal to the growth direction Z . In an another aspect of a VMJ cell, under typical operation conditions, a 1 cmVMJ solar cell can output nearly 25 volts because generally N\u02dc40 constituent cells are connected in series. Thus, eight VMJ solar cells electrically connected in series can produce nearly 200 V. Furthermore, connection in series of the constituent solar cells in the VMJ solar cell can lead to a low-current state when the VMJ solar cell is not illuminated uniformly or a failure, open-circuit condition when one or more of the constituent solar cells in the VMJ solar cell is not illuminated, since current output of a chain of series-connected electrically active elements, such as the constituent solar cells upon illumination, is typically limited by a cell that produces the lowest amount of current. Under non-uniform illumination, produced power output substantially depends on the details of collected light incident on the VMJ cell, or substantially any or any active PV element.

However, when PV cells are located near a focal locus (e.g., a point or a line) of collected light, non-uniform illumination can result in a poor illumination of a portion of PV cells (see, e.g., ) and thus substantially reduce energy conversion performance; e.g., reduce power output of a set of PV cells within a PV module.","It should be appreciated that solar concentrators disclosed in the subject innovation, e.g., solar concentrator , are designed tolerate spatial fluctuations (e.g., dimensional variations of various structural elements) within the structure's construction. In addition, the disclosed solar concentrators, e.g. , also can tolerate environmental fluctuations such as (i) substantial daily temperature gradients, which can be a common occurrence in some deployments sites with desert-like weather conditions (e.g., Nevada, US; Colorado, US; Northern Australia; and so forth); and severe storm conditions like high-speed winds and hailstorms, or the like. It should be readily understood that environmental fluctuations can substantially affect structural conditions, which in addition to substantially any type of stress(es) can offset focused sunlight from a designed or intended focal locus. The fluctuations, or variations, typically shift portions of a focused light pattern up or down in the direction of a minor axis of a support beam for the solar receiver, and left or right in the direction of the major axis of the support beam vertical centerline. By positioning PV active elements (e.g., VMJ solar cells, triple junction solar cells)  within an optimal location, e.g., a location referred informally as a \u201csweet spot,\u201d within the intended focal light pattern, for example, the light pattern overlapping the PV cell(s) pattern, detrimental effects associated with such variations in the light patterns can be mitigated because PV active element(s) can remain illuminated even though light focus may shift.","As discussed below, PV elements can be configured or arranged in layouts that ensure light incidence on the PV elements substantially irrespective of fluctuations of light focus. In an aspect of the subject innovation, by orienting PV cells (e.g., VMJ solar cells) on a receiver as discussed below, output of parabolic solar collector system  can be substantially resilient to non-uniform illumination at the focal locus (e.g., point, line, or arc) because each unit cell within a VMJ cell can have at least a portion of its side section (e.g., width) illuminated; see, e.g.,  and associated description.

Therefore, to optimize performance, strings of PV active elements can be current-matched based on a performance characterization conducted in a test-bed under conditions (e.g., wavelengths and concentration intensity) substantially similar to those expected normal operating conditions of the solar collector system.","In addition, current-matched strings can be arranged geometrically to optimize power generation. For example, when three strings (e.g., rows -) are connected in parallel to form a cluster, a middle string (e.g., row ) can include the highest performance current-matched PV active elements, since the middle string is likely to be positioned in the optimal location of the focused collected light beam or optical image. Moreover, top string (e.g., ) can be the second highest performing string, and bottom string (e.g., ) can be the third highest performing string. In such arrangement, when the image shifts upward, the top and middle string can be fully illuminated while the bottom string is likely to be partially illuminated, providing higher power output than when the focused light beam image shifts downward thus illuminating the middle and lower string in full while the top string is partially illuminated.

When PV cell pair  is not illuminated due to a shift of focused light pattern , the first blocking diode prevents current backflow to pair  due to it underperforming or non-performing condition, while the second blocking diode allows electrical current output from ancillary pair  into the PV cells that remain illuminated, and thus functional, within cluster . A similar embodiment that includes blocking diodes in configuration  can be realized. However, in such embodiment, the first diode can be embodied in diode  after reconnection in series among the first (leftmost) pair of PV cells in cluster and the remainder of PV elements in said cluster.","It is noted that for when VMJ cells comprise clusters -, the large reverse bias breakdown voltage associated with the VMJ cells, render unnecessary connection of bypass diodes among sub-set(s) of VMJ cells within a cluster.

It is noted that larger redundant pairs also can be utilized in configurations with blocking diodes in substantially the same manner as described supra. In an aspect, a PV module consisting of a set of PV clusters utilized for energy conversion can include ancillary cells  and , to accommodate shifts of focused light pattern in both directions along the axis of the pattern. Moreover, ancillary or redundant PV cells can be laid out in alternative or additional positions in the vicinity of clusters , or to passively correct operation when focused pattern  shifts in alternative directions.

At act  a parabolic reflector is assembled. Assembly includes bending an originally flat reflective element (e.g., a thin glass mirror) into a parabolic section, or a trough shape, through support ribs of varying size attached to a support beam. In an aspect, the initially flat reflective material is rectangular in shape and the support beam in oriented along the major axis of the rectangle. Various materials and attachment means, including an integrated option for support ribs and beam, can be employed for mass producing or assembling the parabolic reflector.","At act  a plurality of arrays of assembled parabolic reflectors is mounted in a support frame. The number of assembled parabolic reflectors that are included in each of the arrays depends at least in part on a desired size of a sunlight collection area, which can be determined primarily by the utility intended for the collected light. In addition, size of the arrays is also affected, at least in part, by a desired uniformity of a light beam pattern collected on a focal locus in a receiver. Increased uniformity is typically attained with smaller array sizes. In an aspect of the subject innovation parabolic reflectors are position at the same focal distance from the receiver in order to increase uniformity of the collected light pattern.","At act  a position of each reflector in the plurality of arrays is adjusted to optimize a light beam concentrated on a receiver. The adjustment can be implemented at a time of deployment of a solar concentrator or upon utilization in a test phase or in production mode. In addition adjustment can be performed while operating the solar concentrator based at least in part on measured operation data and related performance metrics generated from the data. Adjustment typically aims at attaining a uniform collected light pattern on the receiver, which includes a PV module for energy conversion. In addition to uniformity, the light pattern is adjusted for focusing substantially completely onto the PV active elements (e.g., solar cells in the PV module) to increase the performance of the module. The adjustment can be performed automatically via a tracking system installed in, or functionally coupled to, the solar collector. Such an automated system can increase complexity of the receiver because circuitry associated with a control component and related measurement devices is to be installed in the receiver in order to implement the tracking or optimization. Yet, costs associated with the increased complexity can be offset by increased performance of the PV module as a result of retaining an optimal sunlight concentration configuration for the reflectors within the array(s).","At act  a photovoltaic module is configured on the receiver in accordance with a pattern of concentrated light in the receiver. In an aspect of the subject innovation, even an optimal configuration of mounted parabolic reflectors can results in a non-uniform shape of a light beam pattern focused on the receiver due to at least one of imperfections on reflective surface(s) of the reflectors, torsional distortion of reflective surface(s) and associated distortion of pattern of reflected light, accumulation of stains on reflective surface(s), or the like Accordingly, PV cells such as VMJs, thin-film tandem solar cells, triple-junction solar cells, or nanostructured solar cells in the PV module can be arranged in clusters of disparate shapes, or units, () so as to increase exposure to collected light and thus increase energy conversion performance.
