title: Secure remote content activation and unlocking
abstract: Systems and methods are provided to enable secure remote activation and/or unlocking of content or other media assets protected using one or more copy protection mechanisms or techniques. Existing trusted processor architectures used by electronic devices (e.g., HD-DVD or Blu-Ray optical disc readers) can be used to allow remote activation and/or unlocking of protected content. An authorization server is configured to identify the specific copy of the protected content or other media assets at the device from the request, and determine the correct correlation between the request and information that enables the device to initiate playback of the protected content. Accordingly, the authorization server maintains secret or private on the authorization server the information that can be used by other parties to obtain a correlation between the request and any response received from the authorization server that enable the device to initiate playback of the protected content.

{"@attributes":{"id":"description"},"RELAPP":[{},{}],"heading":["CROSS-REFERENCES TO RELATED APPLICATIONS","BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION","BRIEF SUMMARY OF THE INVENTION","DETAILED DESCRIPTION OF THE INVENTION"],"p":["This application claims priority to and the benefit of U.S. Provisional Patent Application No. 61\/055,212, filed May 22, 2008, the entire disclosure of which is herein incorporated by reference for all purposes.","Content provided on High-Definition (HD) Digital Video\/Versatile Discs (DVD), with either Blu-ray or HD-DVD standards technologies, brings many more features than just a better visual experience. Among these features can include enhanced copy protection, such the Advanced Access Content System (AACS). AACS is a standard for content distribution and digital rights management (DRM), intended to restrict access to and copying of the content found on the next generation of optical discs and DVDs and high-definition media.","Since around 2006 when devices began including the functionality to play back content protected using enhanced copy protection mechanisms, such as AACS, \u201chackers\u201d ranging from enthusiastic home computer hobbyists to malicious users using advanced techniques on personal computers (PCs), in particular, have been able to retrieve decryption keys used to protect the content. In general, these hackers take advantage of a PC software players' weaknesses to exploit the enhanced copy protection mechanisms. As a result, AACS decryption keys in particular have been extracted from weakly protected PC software players. These decryption keys have further been published around the Internet for use by others. While measures may be taken to revoke the corrupted or exposed decryption keys, it is usually only a matter of time before new keys are exposed or corrupted using the same techniques.","Most copy protection mechanisms propose having a trusted processor. The trusted processor can forbid or otherwise disallow unauthorized applications or even the user from accessing memory in the clear that would expose decrypted data that is otherwise stored as encrypted data. Recently, most if not all consumer electronic devices that include these enhanced copy protection mechanisms, such as those that play AACS protected content, incorporate some form of trusted processor architecture. Yet, trusted processor architectures may not be able to prevent applications or users from accessing data once the data has left a device, such as when the device requests authorization from a remote server to locally access protected content. Additionally, extending existing trusted processor architectures can increase the complexity of a device, and thus can also increase the cost of consumer electronics.","Accordingly, what is desired are improved methods and apparatus for secure remote content activation and\/or unlocking that solves at least some of the problems discussed herein of prior solutions. Additionally, what is desired are improved methods and apparatus for reducing at least some of the drawbacks discussed herein of prior solutions.","In various embodiments, systems and methods are provided to enable secure remote activation and\/or unlocking of content or other media assets protected using one or more copy protection mechanisms or techniques. In various embodiments, existing trusted processor architectures used by electronic devices (e.g., HD-DVD or Blu-Ray optical disc readers) can be augmented to allow remote activation and\/or unlocking of protected content. An electronic device may be configured to generate and send a request to an authorization server requesting access to the protected content or other media assets without divulging information through the request that can be used by anyone other party than a designated party to obtain a correlation between the request and any response received from the authorization server that enable the device to initiate playback of the protected content. The authorization server is configured to identify the specific copy of the protected content or other media assets at the device from the request, and determine the correct correlation between the request and information that enables the device to initiate playback of the protected content. Accordingly, in various embodiments, the authorization server is configured to maintain secret or private on the authorization server the information that can be used by other parties to obtain a correlation between the request and any response received from the authorization server that enable the device to initiate playback of the protected content thereby reducing or substantially eliminating the likelihood of unauthorized access to the protected content.","In one embodiment, an authorization server may obtain or otherwise determine an identifier, such as a Pre-recorded Media Serial Number employed by AASC, bound to a specific copy of the protected content or other media assets and, based on a correlation maintained or held at the authorization server, information that enables electronic devices or content readers to unlock the protected content. The authorization server then may forward this unlocking information to a requesting device without divulging to anyone other party how to obtain the specific correlation between what is sent from the requesting device and any response sent from the authorization server that enables the requesting device to initiate playback of the protected content. The requesting device may then access the content as usual using the unlocking information. Thus, in some embodiments, it is more difficulty to find a correlation between the specific copy of the content or other media asset and the unlocking information for the copy without the information held secret at the authorization server.","In some embodiments, the correlation between an electronic device's request to unlock content or other media assets and the identifier bound to the specific copy of the content or other media assets may be determined at the authorization server in response to at least a portion of the identifier found within the request. The authorization server may determine non-algorithmically the correlation between the request and the identifier bound to the copy of the content or other media assets, for example, using a lookup table. In one embodiment, the authorization server may determine the correlation between the request and the identifier bound to the copy of the content or other media assets using a number of bits associated with identifier that substantially reduces or otherwise alters the likelihood of success of a brute force attack or other attack on the authentication process.","In various embodiments, the authorization server may encrypt the unlocking information at the authorization server using an encryption key associated with the authorization server. The encrypted information can further remove exposure of any correlation between the information sent to the authorization server requesting access to content and the information returned from the authorization server. In further embodiments, a determination may be performed whether the information for unlocking the content is valid. If the information for unlocking the content is not valid, a delay value may be calculated using an exponential function. One or more requests from the content reader to obtain information for unlocking the content may be delayed based on the delay value.","A further understanding of the nature and the advantages of the inventions disclosed herein may be realized by reference to the remaining portions of the specification and the accompanying drawings.","In the world of distribution, providers of content or other media assets, such as music, audio books, videos, movies, or the like, may desire to distribute the content digitally in a variety of formats and targeted to a variety of devices. For example, content providers may distribute digital content in physical format, such as using CDs, DVDs, or flash memory devices. Content providers may also allow digital content to be distributed electronically over communications networks, such as being downloaded from websites or other digital media distribution services.","Digital content can be distributed in universally readable or accepted formats or standards or in proprietary formats. Containers of digital content may further include restrictions on how the digital content may be consumed or otherwise played, where the digital content may be played, when the digital content may be played, or the like. Digital content may also be encrypted before or during distribution, and subsequently decrypted for use by a user or device.",{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0022","num":"0021"},"figref":["FIG. 1","FIG. 100"],"b":"100"},"In one embodiment, system  includes one or more user devices  (e.g., user devices A, B, and C).

Merely by way of example, one or more of server computers  can be one or more general purpose computers capable of executing programs or scripts in response to user devices  and\/or other server computers , including without limitation web applications (which might, in some cases, be configured to perform methods of the invention).","Merely by way of example, a web application can be implemented as one or more scripts or programs written in any programming language, such as Java, C, or C++, and\/or any scripting language, such as Perl, Python, or TCL, as well as combinations of any programming\/scripting languages. The application server(s) can also include database servers, including without limitation those commercially available from Oracle, Microsoft, IBM and the like, which can process requests from database clients running on one of user devices  and\/or another of server computer .","In some embodiments, an application server can generate information dynamically for secure remote content activation and unlocking in accordance with embodiments of the invention. Data provided by an application server may be formatted (comprising HTML, XML, Javascript, AJAX, etc., for example) and\/or may be forwarded to one of user devices  via a web server (as described above, for example). Similarly, a web server might receive requests and\/or input data from one of user devices  and\/or forward the requests and\/or input data to an application server.","In accordance with further embodiments, one or more of server computers  can function as a content server and\/or can include one or more of the files necessary to implement methods of the invention incorporated by an application running on one of user devices  and\/or another of servers . Alternatively, as those skilled in the art will appreciate, a content server can include all necessary files, allowing such an application to be invoked remotely by one or more of user devices  and\/or server computers . It should be noted that the functions described with respect to various servers herein (e.g., application server, database server, web server, file server, etc.) can be performed by a single server and\/or a plurality of specialized servers, depending on implementation-specific needs and parameters.","In certain embodiments, system  can include one or more databases  (e.g., databases A and B). The location of the database(s)  is discretionary: merely by way of example, database A might reside on a storage medium local to (and\/or resident in) server computer A (and\/or one or more of user devices ). Alternatively, database B can be remote from any or all of user devices  and server computers , so long as it can be in communication (e.g., via communications network ) with one or more of these.

In some embodiments, activation device  may be embodied within user device . Some examples of activation device  may include consumer electronic devices, optical disc players, digital video recorders (DVRs), satellite\/cable tuners, personal computers, laptops, workstations, mainframes, servers, tablet PCs, mobile PCs, game consoles, personal digital assistants (PDAs), smartphones, cell phones, or the like.","In one example of operation of system , to enable access to protected content, for example, user device  may receive protected content  for playback. Protected content  may include content or other media assets, such as textual information, audio information, image information, videos, movies, multimedia information, or the like, as well as hardware and\/or software elements configured to protect access to the content or other media assets. Without proper access, information, or authorization, a user or device may not be able to initiate playback or otherwise access all or a portion of the content or other media assets associated with protected content . Protected content  may further include one or more mechanisms to implement tamper resistances, intrusion detection, or to employ a digital restrictions\/rights management (DRM) scheme, watermarks, encryption\/decryption, or the like. Protected content  may be distributed in any number of human or machine-readable formats, containers, or physical media.","Continuing the previous example, user device  may generate information (e.g., unlock request ) requesting remote content activation and\/or unlocking. Unlock request  can include information requesting access to all or a potion of protected content  from activation device . In one example, unlock request  may include information that identifies protected content . For example, unlock request  may include a content identifier, a title identifier, a virtual or physical volume identifier, a format or container identifier, DRM or encryption schemes, or the like. Unlock request  may further include information associated with user device . For example, unlock request  may include a device identifier, device information, device profiles, firmware information, software and\/or hardware information, user identifier, user profiles, user preferences, or the like.","User device  may communicate unlock request  to activation device  on behalf of one or more users or other devices in an attempt to obtain one or more levels of access to all or a portion of protected content . Unlock request  can be sent or transmitted using a variety of mechanisms. For example, unlock request  may be sent via an electronic connection, a system bus, a communications bus, or the like. Unlock request  may further be sent or shared using a communications network, such as the Internet. Unlock request  may be shared via telephone service or automated interactive phone response system. Unlock request  may also be shared using a Universal Serial Bus (USB) key or fob, non-volatile or flash memory device, a smartcard, or the like.","Based on unlock request , activation device  may generate information (e.g., unlock response ) that enables user device  to determine whether remote content activation and\/or unlocking has occurred at activation device . Unlock response  may include information that enables user device  to access the requested portion of protected content . In one example, activation device  may further generate information that indicates to user device  one or levels of access to a requested portion of protected content . Unlock response  may include encryption\/decryption keys, authorization codes, or other information allowing user device  to access all or a portion of protected content .","Based on receiving information indicating remote content activation and\/or unlocking via unlock response , user device  can initiate playback of the content or other media assets associated with protected content . User device  may initiate playback of the content or other media assets with full access, partial access, time-based access, use-based access, or the like.","In various embodiments, system  can provide remote content activation and\/or unlocking of content protected using one or more pre-existing copy protection mechanisms, such as AACS. System  may incorporate remote content activation and\/or unlocking using AACS automatically via the Internet, or other communications networks, or by using manual mechanisms, such as asking the user to get an access code from a web site, calling a 1-800 number, or the like. In conjunction with AACS, system  can provide a more secure activation and\/or unlocking of a content title stored on a disc (e.g., protected content ) for access by a (HD) DVD player (e.g., user device ) after remote activation and\/or unlocking from a remote server (e.g., activation device ).","Typically, the AACS authorization process causes one or more piece of information associated with the disc's title to be sent to an authorization server. For example, the following information may be sent from a user's disc player to enable playback of movie content stored on an AACS protected disc:\n\n","If the authorization server authorizes the user's player to unlock the title, the authorization server may send the following information back to the user's player:\n\n","Based on the information sent from the authorization server, the user's player then is given access to the protected movie content for playback.","However, most copy protection mechanism that implement remote unlocking of content, such as the AACS method above, employ an open correlation between information sent from a user's player to a remote authorization server and information sent from the remote authorization server to the user's player to obtain access to the disc's protected content. This open correlation can be exploited potentially giving users unauthorized access to protected content.","Consider an example, where a user using a first device or player to play back protected content may pay for authorization or otherwise obtain the keys or other unlocking information for unlocking the protected content for playback. Due to the open correlation discussed above, the user can then store the keys and unlocking information, making it available for subsequent unauthorized use by the user or other users because the user knows the correlation between information sent to a remote authorization server to unlock the content and the unlocking information returned. As a result, the same user or any number of different user can then unlock the same protected content with the stored information both using a second device or player that may not be authorized and\/or without compensation to the content provider. Accordingly, the stored unlocking information can be re-used in an illegitimate, potentially malicious, and\/or possibly illegal manner to enable unauthorized access to the protected content.","As transmissions between a user's player and the proper authorization server can be intercepted and\/or redirected, due to the open correlation, the authorization process can be substantially altered. Furthermore, correct data for unlocking content may potentially be sent to a user's player without executing the actual transaction as envisioned by the content provider. For example, according to some HD formats, AACS protected content or other media assets can contain a manifest file in which a list of servers is stored. This server list may have between 2 and 26 server Uniform Resource Identifiers (URIs) identifying a server's address, such as using a Uniform Resource Locator (URL) or a Uniform Resource Number (URN). A potential way to hijack AACS protection of the content stored on the disc may be to intercept transmissions to one or more of the URIs in the list of servers.","The user having previously obtained authorization may merely modify routing of communications associated with another user or an unauthorized second device or player to an alternative server, such as one not listed in the URIs in the list of servers associated with the protected content. While the second device or player may send a request to one of the URIs in the list of servers associated with the protected content, the request may be redirected to the alternative server bypassing the established authorization process. Given the PMSN of an AACS protected title is embedded in the request intercepted from the second device or player, the alternative server can return a valid key encrypted with that PMSN. When the second device or player receives the encrypted key, the given title will be unlocked as normal.","In general, it can be very difficult or impossible for the second device or player to detect that any deviation from the normal unlocking process has occurred at this point. For the second device or player, this deviation may be the desired result of a user to unlock protected content without payment or authorization from the content provider. Additionally, this deviation may have a malicious outcome to take advantage of unsuspecting users, similar to pharming or phishing attacks used on the Internet.","Accordingly, in various embodiments, system  enables protected content to be distributed by content providers in such a manner to make the above deviations much more difficult. In one embodiment, the open correlation illustrated above and commonly associated with AACS between information sent to and from an authorization server may be removed by implementing secure remote content activation and\/or unlocking wherein the correlation is known only to the authorization server. Thus, the likelihood is reduced or substantially eliminated that users (malicious or otherwise) can circumvent safe and designated authorization processes envisioned by content providers. Additionally, end users conscious of privacy may consider the process more protected since the user can consider system  as trusted.",{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0050","num":"0055"},"figref":"FIG. 3","b":["300","300","310","320","330","310","320","330"]},"Content reader  may be embodied as one of user devices  of . In various embodiments, content reader  can include a standalone HD-DVD or Blu-Ray disc player or HD-DVD or Blu-Ray disc player incorporated in a gaming device, such as a SONY PLAYSTATION 3 or MICROSOFT XBOX, and may receive protected content from a variety of sources. For example, content reader  may receive protected content via disc  as shown. In some embodiments disc  and\/or its contents may be protected using AACS. Disc  may include PMSN . In general, PMSNs can be provided by content providers to manufacturers and distributors of protected content. Typically, PMSNs may be stored such that they are generally unavailable to the end user by accessible to devices compatible with AACS protected content. For example, PMSN  may be stored on a portion of disc  that is usually unreadable directly by a user, a user process, or user application associated with content reader , but that can be read by a system process or system application compatible with AACS.","In one example of operation, system  can provide secure remote content activation and\/or unlocking of protected content, such as by building upon an authorization process used by AACS, by removing the open correlation between information sent seeking access to protected content and the unlocking information sent in return. As discussed previously, without this open correlation, it becomes more difficult for an attacker or other user to circumvent the distribution of unlocking information from authorized sources.",{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0053","num":"0058"},"figref":["FIG. 4","FIG. 4","FIG. 4","FIG. 3"],"b":["400","410","300"]},"In step , a request is generated at a content reader (e.g., content reader  of ) requesting access to protected content. For example, upon loading disc  into content reader , content reader  may attempt to access a portion of protected content stored on disc . Content reader  may generate the request based on a portion of content being marked as protected or its inability to read, interpret, or otherwise decode\/decrypt the content.","In step , the request is sent to an authorization server (e.g., activation server ). The request may be sent automatically via a communications network, such as the Internet, or using one or more mechanisms that involve a user, such as manually transferring the request to the authorization server. In some embodiments, the request may be communicated via one or more human or non-human intermediaries.","In step , a correlation is determined at the authorization server between information associated with the request and a pre-recorded serial number (PMSN) associated with the content. The correlation can include any mapping, function, transformation, or the like between information related to the request and the PMSN associated with the content.","In various embodiments, a function PMSN-G( ) can be defined as a combination function to generate a PMSN from two pieces of information, PMSN_A and PMSN_B. Symmetrically, this function has the following property as seen in equation (1):\n\nPMSN-(PMSN)=PMSN,PMSN\u2003\u2003(1)\n","In one example, PMSN_A and PMSN_B can include 4 numbers of m and n bits, respectively. In addition, PMSN_B may be defined as in equation (2) such that PMSN_B can be retrieved from PMSN_A using a function PMSN-E( ):\n\nPMSN=PMSN-(PMSN)\u2003\u2003(2)\n","In step , the PMSN associated with the content is obtained at the authorization server based on the correlation. For example, the PMSN may be determined at activation server  from PMSN-G(PMSN_A, PMSN-E(PMSN_A)). In various embodiments, PMSN-G( ) may provide a non-algorithmic mapping to the corresponding PMSN further reducing or otherwise substantially eliminating any open correlation as discussed previously. This may be embodied as a lookup table. In some embodiments, PMSN-G( ) may provide an algorithmic determination of the corresponding PMSN.","In step , information to unlock the content is determined at the authorization server based on the PMSN. For example, activation server  may determine activation codes, encryption\/decryption keys, digital signatures, or the like, that enable the content to be directly or indirectly unlocked. In step , the information to unlock the content is sent from the authorization server to the content reader.  ends in step .","Accordingly, PMSN-E( ) in the above example may be kept secret on the authorization server (e.g., activation server ). Therefore, in various embodiments, system  may prevent PMSN-E( ) from being shared or otherwise exchanged to the end user or intercepting users during an authentication process of communicating information between content reader  and activation server . Thereby, the potential open correlations can be removed between information requesting access to protected content and information for unlocking the content received from an authorized unlocking server. As discussed above, system  can share a fraction of PMSN during the unlock process. In one embodiment, content reader  may send an unlock request to activation server  that may include {Title_ID, Volume_ID, PMSN_A, Player_ID}. PMSN_A may correspond to a fraction of the PMSN, such as the first n of m number of bits associated with PMSN. Thus, in the event that a malicious user gains access to PMSN_A, simply having possession of PMSN_A still fails to provide a user with enough information for the generation of the corresponding PMSN. Thus, system  can provide that even though a breach in one or more preexisting copy protection security processes may occur, and their associated keys become available publicly, the complete unlocking information required to access the protected content still may not be generated since PMSN-E( ) is unknown outside of activation server .","In various embodiments, aspects of secure remote content activation and\/or unlocking may be implemented via one or more application programming interfaces (APIs) that interact with some kind of trusted core embedded in authorized devices. For example, content reader  of  may be embodied as an authorized content playback device with middleware that supports a Blu-ray Disc Java (BD-J) virtual machine, a BD+ special virtual machine, an HD-DVD ecmascript virtual machine, or the like. In general, BD-J can support Java ME \u201cXlets\u201d for advanced content on Blu-ray Discs. BD-J may allow content on Blu-ray Disc titles to be far more sophisticated than bonus content provided by standard DVD, including such features as network access, picture-in-picture, and access to expanded local storage.","In various embodiments, invocation of BD-J Xlets may be triggered by events occurring around them, for example, by the selection of a movie title, or by the insertion of a new disc. Xlets in turn can then call other Xlets into play. Security in BD-J can be based on the Java platform security model, enabling signed applications, for example, to perform more tasks than a non-signed application, such as Read\/Write access to local storage, network access, selection of other titles on the BD-ROM disc, and control of other running BD-J applications. In one implementation, BD-J applications can use the java.net package to connect to servers (e.g., activation server ).","The BD+ special virtual machine forms part of the Blu-ray Digital Rights Management System. BD+ typically includes a small virtual machine embedded in authorized players. BD+ may allow content providers to include executable programs on Blu-ray Discs. These programs may examine the host environment, to see if the player has been tampered with, verify that the player's keys have not been changed, execute native code, possibly to patch an otherwise insecure system, transform the audio and video output, or the like. In general, a program which can be found inside the BDSVM directory of a BD+ protected disc is called content code. The content code can be executed on a virtual big endian DLX-like processor. BD+ provides the content code with 25 system calls or \u201ctraps\u201d which are used as the interfaces between the virtual machine and the content player.","For HD-DVD, Advanced Content can be used to provide interactive menus and \u201cspecial features\u201d such as additional bonus\/extras content and games. The Advanced Content runtime engine is responsible for responding to user navigation input (e.g., from a remote control) as well as events set to occur during playback of a movie, controlling all actions and interactive properties during the playback of a movie. In general, Advanced Content can be written using the XML language and the ECMAScript language. Advanced Content applications can be very similar in structure to AJAX applications on the web, using a combination of script and markup in an asynchronous execution model. To support the ECMAScript code, Advanced Content defines a large number of objects, properties, and methods (\u201cAPIs\u201d) that are analogous to the DOM in a web browser; these APIs allow the script to query and control the player, animate the markup page, respond to user events, and connect to the Internet.",{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0066","num":"0071"},"figref":["FIG. 5","FIG. 5"],"b":["310","505"]},"In block , content reader  may receive a PMSN. For example, a software player executing on content reader  may interact with hardware and\/or software elements associated with content reader  to receive PMSN  from disc . In various embodiments, PMSN  may be obtained by interacting with a virtual machine or BD middleware security APIs.","In block , content reader  determines PMSN_A based on the PMSN. For example, content reader  may determine PMSN_A  from PMSN-G(PMSN ) as discussed above with respect to equation (1). PMSN_A  is then transmitted to activation server . Although only PMSN_A  is shown being transmitted from content reader  to activation server , other information may also be included.","In block , activation server  determines the PMSN based on PMSN_A. For example, activation server  can determine the PMSN using PMSN=PMSN-G(PMSN_A, PMSN-E(PMSN_A)). In various embodiments, PMSN-G( ) may provide a non-algorithmic mapping to the corresponding PMSN. This may be embodied as a lookup table, or any other random non-deterministic mapping. In some embodiments, PMSN-G( ) may provide an algorithmic determination of the corresponding PMSN.","Having the PMSN, in block , activation server  determines an unlock key associated with the protected content. The unlock key may be in encrypted or plain form at this point. Activation server  may generate additional unlock information, such as required by the AACS method or other copy protection mechanisms. For example, activation server  may encrypt data using the unlock key (e.g., a Title\/CPS key) with a cipher-based message authentication code (CMAC) to generate a certificate. In general, CMAC can include a block cipher-based message authentication code algorithm, which may be used to provide assurance of the authenticity and, hence, the integrity of binary data. Activation server  may encrypt the PMSN using CMAC with the unlock key to generate the certificate to include the PMSN. Activation server  may further encrypt the Player_ID with the unlock key.","In block , activation server  encrypts the unlock key with a server secret. For example, activation server  may encrypt an encrypted title\/CPS key using a function SERVER-E( ) and the PMSN to generate an encrypted response . Other information may be included in encrypted response . For example, encrypted response  may include the certificate and PMSN encrypted by an activation and\/or unlocking server, such as SERVER-E({CMAC(Kt,PMSN), CMAC(Kt,Player_ID), AES-G(Kvu,Kt)}, PMSN). Encrypted response  then may be sent to content reader .","In block , content reader  decrypts the unlock key. For example, using SERVER-E( ), content reader  determines the unlock key and whether the unlocking information was recited from activation server  as an authorized server. In block , content reader  may determine whether the unlock key is valid. If the transaction is authorized, but the unlock key is wrong or otherwise invalid, an event or other indication may be triggered that the secure remote content activation and\/or unlocking process of system  is under attack.","In block , if the unlock key is valid, content reader  unlocks the content to gain access. Content reader  may be given an unlock key that enables full or partial access, or one or more levels of restricted or unrestricted access. Access may further be based on time, data usage, content usage, ratings, or the like.  ends in block .","As illustrated above, PMSN-E( ) may be maintained as a secret on activation server . This can prevent an attacker from determining any correlation between information requesting the unlocking key, and the unlocking information itself. Thus, in various embodiments, system  may allow content providers to distribute protected content is a more secure manner, while allowing the convenience of secure remote content activation and\/or unlocking",{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0075","num":"0080"},"figref":["FIGS. 6A","FIGS. 6A","FIG. 6A"],"b":["6","6","600","6","6","605"]},"In step , a PMSN is received identifying content.

In step , the unlock information is encrypted using SERVER-E( ) and the PMSN. The processing ends in step  of  and continues via block A in step  of .","Referring now to , in step , the encrypted unlock information is transmitted. In step , the encrypted unlock information is decrypted using SERVER-E( ). In step , a determination is made whether the unlock information includes a valid key.","Based on a determination in step  that the unlock information includes a valid key, in step , the content is unlocked. The valid key may provide one or more levels of full or otherwise restricted access to protected content. The processing then ends in  in step .","Based on a determination in step  that the unlock information includes an invalid key, the processing ends in step  of  and continues via block B in step  of .","Referring now to , in step , a retry delay is determined. In step , resending of the authorization request is delayed based on the retry delay. In various embodiments, the delay may be determined exponentially such that each time an error occurs, a larger delay than the previous is experience. This allows an authorization system (e.g., system ) to better react to brute force attack.
