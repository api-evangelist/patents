The description herein may include concepts that could be pursued, but are not necessarily ones that have been previously conceived or pursued. Therefore, unless otherwise indicated herein, what is described in this section is not prior art to the description and claims in this application and is not admitted to be prior art by inclusion in this section.","Certain abbreviations that may be found in the description and\/or in the Figures are herewith defined as follows:","AES advanced encryption standard","AMI amazon machine image","API application programing interface","AWS Amazon Web Services","DB database","DC domain controller","DEK data encryption key","EBS (Amazon) elastic block store","ELB (Amazon) elastic load balancer","EMR (Amazon) elastic map reduce","FIPS federal information processing standards","HSM hardware security module","ID identification","JVM java virtual memory","KEK key encryption key","KM key management","KMS key management service","PII personally identifiable information","RDS relational database service","SDK software development kit","SSH secure shell","SSL secure sockets layer","VM virtual memory","Cloud computing is an approach to sharing computing resources over the Internet. One area of cloud computing includes a host provider (for example, cloud provider) providing virtual server instances on which devices can run applications. Public Cloud Applications often need to secure sensitive information such as data encryption keys or user\/system credentials. Main challenges in securing such information are to deliver \u2018master keys\u2019 to cloud applications and to establish trust to instances and applications running in public cloud environment. Examples of applications available in such a cloud environment can include social media applications, and applications provided by Yahoo\u00ae, EBay\u00ae, and Amazon\u00ae to name only a few. As these applications are run in a cloud separate from a private cloud device and its application service provider special attention needs to be given to application data security. In this regard at least a problem exists in that application data security may not be trusted to be provided by the cloud provider. This invention presents solutions to at least the above described problems.","In an exemplary aspect of the invention, there is a method comprising: deploying, with a device of a private network, an application instance with an application web service in a cloud network; and based on the deploying, communicating with the application web service in the cloud network to establish a trust relationship with the application web service for the application instance.","In another exemplary aspect of the invention, there is an apparatus comprising: at least one processor, and at least one memory including computer program code, where the at least one memory and the computer program code are configured, with the at least one processor, to cause the apparatus to at least: deploy, with a device of a private network, an application instance with an application web service in a cloud network; and based on the deploying, communicate with the application web service in the cloud network to establish a trust relationship with the application web service for the application instance.","In another exemplary aspect of the invention, there is an apparatus comprising: means for deploying, with a device of a private network, an application instance with an application web service in a cloud network; and means, based on the deploying, for communicating with the application web service in the cloud network to establish a trust relationship with the application web service for the application instance.","In accordance with the exemplary embodiments as described in the paragraph above, the means for deploying and the means for communicating comprises an interface to a communication network, and a computer readable medium including computer program code, the computer program code executed by at least one processor.","The exemplary embodiments of the invention provide at least a method to provide cloud centric trust validation including deploying sensitive applications to a public cloud by utilizing a model and pushing master keys to the cloud from a trusted zone such as within a corporate network.","Current state of technology depends on encryption operations and key management systems deployed within public cloud environments and\/or leveraging trust validation solution that exclusively or significantly depend on validation of applications from within the public cloud. Both of these factors will pose various security and compliance risks to users and other entities.","Establishing trust between cloud applications and corporate network is usually done using \u2018pull\u2019 mechanism, where cloud application connects to a corporate network and identifies itself with specific authentication information such as SSH keys or other credentials. The challenge in this kind of model is how to deliver that authentication information to cloud applications in the first place. Previous solutions have not been very secure (because of a chicken-and-egg type of situation) or they've been very dependent on specific cloud provider security controls. The exemplary embodiments of the invention provide at least a method and apparatus to \u2018push\u2019 master keys generated for a private network, such as a corporate network, for establishing a most secure trust between the cloud applications and the corporate network.",{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0020","num":"0019"},"figref":["FIG. 1","FIG. 1","FIG. 1"],"b":["100","100","110","120","120","150","150","170","160","180","150"]},"This invention presents a model where only non-sensitive information is required to be stored to cloud and using that, public and non-sensitive information, corporate network can safely and securely deploy new applications by pushing the required master keys to new cloud instances.

The server  includes a controller, such as at least one computer or a data processor (DP) A, at least one computer-readable memory medium embodied as a memory (MEM) B that stores a program of computer instructions (PROG) C, and at least one suitable RF transceiver D for communication with the ED  via antennas F (several when MIMO operation is in use). The server  is coupled via a data\/control path F to the ED . The path F may be implemented such as by a wired and\/or wireless connection. The server  can also be coupled to another device, such as via the data\/control path F to the KMS .","The ED  includes a controller, such as at least one computer or a data processor (DP) A, at least one non-transitory computer-readable memory medium embodied as a memory (MEM) B that stores a program of computer instructions (PROG) C, and at least one suitable radio frequency (RF) transmitter and receiver pair (transceiver) D for bidirectional wireless communications with the key management system , the application server , and\/or another device associated with the cloud via an antenna or antennas F, and\/or a hardwired connection. In addition the KMS  may be directly or indirectly connected to the ED  such as via a connection F.","For the purposes of describing the exemplary embodiments of this invention the application server , the application provider device , and\/or the key management system  may be assumed to include a trust establishmnent function (TEF).
