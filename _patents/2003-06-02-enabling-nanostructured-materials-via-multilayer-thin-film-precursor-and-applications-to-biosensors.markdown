title: Enabling nanostructured materials via multilayer thin film precursor and applications to biosensors
abstract: A thin film based nanoporous alumina template has been developed which allows the in situ removal of an electrically insulating alumina barrier layer at the pore bases. This barrier free nanoporous system has great utility for electrodeposition of a wide variety of nanowire materials. An exemplary multilayer thin film precursor is provided comprising Al (anodization layer), Ti (diffusion barrier) and Pt (active electrode) on a Si substrate. Aluminum anodization in sulfuric acid with a subsequent applied voltage ramping program produces a Pt electrode at the base of the nanopores without the additional steps of alumina removal, barrier layer dissolution, and metal deposition onto the pore bottoms.

Field of the Invention","The present invention relates generally to an anodically generated porous alumina template, and more particularly to a thin-film based multilayer nanoporous template formed on a substrate for the subsequent creation of nanoscale materials.","2. Description of the Prior Art","Anodically generated nanoporous alumina has been widely studied on bulk aluminum substrates and used as a host template for the deposition of a wide variety of materials, see Martin, C. R., Nanomaterials: A membrane-based synthetic approach, Science, 1994, 266 (Dec. 23, 1994): pp. 1961-1965, the entire contents and disclosure of which is hereby incorporated by reference. The work by O'Sullivan and Wood in 1970, see O'Sullivan, J. P. and G. C. Wood, The morphology and mechanism of formation of porous anodic films on aluminum, Proceedings of the Royal Society of London, A., 1970, 317 (1970): pp. 511-543, the entire contents and disclosure of which is hereby incorporated by reference, experimentally examined the role of an applied electric field in steady state pore growth. They proposed that the electric field concentrated at the scalloped inner surfaces of the pore governed pore propagation as well as equilibrium dimensions of pore diameter and barrier layer thickness. This was the first realization that the porous alumina system is dynamic and that the governing parameter (\u0394V) may be manipulated to achieve the desired porous structure including the pore diameter and barrier layer characteristics. Although dynamic, the porous alumina system was still somewhat limited in application. However, the work of these pioneering researchers (O'Sullivan and Wood) was restricted to bulk aluminum metals and the oxidation\/anodization of these bulk aluminum metals, which do not provide any means of eliminating the insulating oxide barrier layer and therefore have limited application for nanowire deposition.","Thus, there is a remaining need to provide a nanoporous, self-assembling, thin-film based template on a substrate with the ability to manipulate the oxide barrier layer in situ, thereby providing a conducting electrode surface at each pore base, with control of the resulting template thickness and pore diameter.","It is therefore an object of the present invention to provide a thin-film based, multilayer, nanoporous anodic alumina template that will provide for the ability to manipulate and eliminate the oxide barrier layer characteristics of the template.","It is a further object to provide a template that provides a conductive electrode surface created in situ (without the requirement of fragile and tedious template removal and handling) at the pore bases.","It is yet another object to provide a template construct on an arbitrary substrate such that \u201cactive\u201d components on the substrate (i.e., integrated silicon based circuitry) may be linked with the nanoporous templated material.","It is yet another object of the present invention to provide a biosensor formed using a multilayer template.","According to a first broad aspect of the present invention, there is provided a means to directly and most efficiently create nanostructures of deposited materials through electrochemical based deposition using, for example, a direct current (DC) galvanostatic method.","According to second broad aspect of the invention, there is provided a suitable diffusion barrier between the anodic alumina template and the underlying electrode layer that may be deposited, for example, by physical vapor deposition and hence converted to its corresponding oxide under anodization.","Other objects and features of the present invention will be apparent from the following detailed description of the preferred embodiment.","It is advantageous to define several terms before describing the invention.

R., Nanomaterials: A membrane-based synthetic approach, Science, 1994, 266 (Dec. 23, 1994): pp. 1961-1965, the entire contents and disclosure of which is hereby incorporated by reference. The present invention provides for the deposition of a thin film of aluminum precursor onto a substrate. The aluminum thin film may be electrochemically anodized to create the nanoporous alumina template. The thin film template offers important new advantages and presents only minimal new challenges when compared to nanoporous alumina formed on bulk aluminum.","The advantages of the thin film template are the (1) ability to manipulate the barrier layer characteristics as required for the appropriate application; (2) ability to create a conducting electrode surface at the pore base; (3) control of the resulting template thickness; (4) integration of templated nanoscale material with integrated circuit (IC) circuitry; and (5) mechanical support of a fragile thin film alumina template.","The present invention provides for the application of a thin film alumina template as a direct pattern transfer mask () for silicon, see Crouse, D. T., et al., Self-ordered pore structure of anodized aluminum on silicon and pattern transfer, Applied Physics Letters, 2000, 76 (January 3): pp. 49-51, the entire contents and disclosure of which is hereby incorporated by reference. As shown in , the alumina barrier layer characteristics at the alumina\/silicon interface demonstrate an atypical curvature reversal as compared to bulk systems, thereby producing a void space at the pore centers which were amenable to selective chemical etching with 5 wt % HPO.","This two-step barrier-free template was then used as a mask for reactive ion etching (RIE) of the silicon substrate. To optimize pore ordering, Masuda developed a silicon-carbon (SiC) nanostamping process that controls the pore nucleation sites thereby improving the regularity and periodicity of the resulting nanoporous structure, Masuda, H., F. Yamada, and M. Satoh, Highly ordered nanochannel-array architecture in anodic alumina, Applied Physics Letters, 1997, 71 (19): p. 2770, the entire contents and disclosure of which is hereby incorporated by reference.","However, a more fundamental problem inherent to the anodization process remains. Under the typical conditions of anodization, an electrically insulating alumina barrier layer exists at the alumina\/substrate interface rendering it difficult to directly deposit materials of interest into the pores by the preferred DC electrodeposition mechanism. Several authors have grown the porous alumina layer several microns thick for mechanical stability and then removed the remaining aluminum metal, see Peng, X. S., et al., Synthesis of highly ordered CdSe nanowire arrays embedded in anodic alumina membrane by electrodeposition in ammonia alkaline solution, Chemical Physics Letters, 2001, 343 (2001): pp. 470-474; Xu, D., et al., Preparation and characterization of CdS nanowire arrays by DC electrodeposition in porous anodic aluminum oxide templates, Chemical Physics Letters, 2000, 325 (2000): pp. 340-344; Xu, D., et al., Electrochemical Preparation of CdSe Nanowire Arrays, Journal of Physical Chemistry B, 2000, 104 (21): pp. 5061-5063; and Chen, R., et al., Silver telluride nanowires prepared by DC electrodeposition in porous anodic alumina templates, Journal of Materials Chemistry, 2002, 12 (2002): pp. 2435-2438, the entire contents and disclosures of which are hereby incorporated by reference. The barrier layer at the base of the pores may then be removed with dilute HPOand a metal of choice is thermally evaporated onto the base of the alumina. However, this tedious and fragile bulk alumina removal technique is not the optimal solution for template based synthesis. Recently, Yang et al. used a simple thin film aluminum-gold (Al\u2014Au) bilayer in an effort to circumvent the need for physically removing the template to achieve elimination of the barrier layer, see Yang, Y., et al., Anodic alumina template on Au\/Si substrate and preparation of CdS nanowires, Solid State Communications, 2002, 123 (2002): pp. 279-282, the entire contents and disclosure of which is hereby incorporated by reference.","However, thin film Al\u2014Pt or Al\u2014Au metal bilayers have two primary drawbacks. Firstly, Al\u2014Pt or Al\u2014Au metal systems form intermetallic phases at or near room temperature which catalyze the deleterious oxygen evolution reaction (OER). Secondly, poor mechanical stability and insufficient substrate adhesion of the porous aluminum oxide template may be observed, see Yang, Y., et al., Anodic alumina template on Au\/Si substrate and preparation of CdS nanowires, Solid State Communications, 2002, 123 (2002): pp. 279-282, the entire contents and disclosure of which is hereby incorporated by reference, when a thin film of Al is anodized on a base layer of thin film Pt or Au. Therefore, the present invention indicates that the successful creation of a barrier-free, thin film based, nanoporous alumina template requires the introduction of a suitable diffusion barrier between the Al thin film precusor and a Pt underlayer.","The present invention demonstrates the use of an Al\u2014Pt\u2014Si multilayer thin film system with a Ti diffusion barrier for the in situ creation of arrays of platinum nanoelectrodes at the base of the thin film alumina host template. The platinum nanoelectrodes are useful for the DC electrodeposition of a wide variety of metals and semiconductors. The existence of a metallic bottom contact to the electrodeposited nanowires is important for a variety of devices requiring electron transport. A Ti diffusion barrier prevents room temperature formation of intermetallic species and when oxidized to TiOprovides good substrate adhesion chracteristics between the alumina template and the Pt base electrode. Additionally, the mechanical stability of the Si substrate greatly improves processing and allows the possibility of future integration with IC components.","In a preferred embodiment of the present invention, the Al\u2014Pt\u2014Si substrate systems may be created, for example, by e-beam evaporation followed by anodization in 0.5 M HSOat 25 v DC. It is not critical to use 0.5 M HSO. A wide range of diprotic acids are suitable for the present invention, such as sulfuric, oxalic, phosphoric acids, etc. The anodization voltage 25 v DC is an exemplary value that is easily changed by one of ordinary skill in the art in light of the teachings of the present invention to create the desired anodic alumina pore diameter. The n-type silicon substrates may be first cut into 15 mm diameter discs from larger wafers with a brass circular bit and diamond paste. The 15 mm diameter wafers may then be RCA cleaned and dipped in a dilute HF solution (1:30 parts water) to remove the native SiO. The cleaned substrates may then immediately be installed into the vacuum system of the e-beam evaporator.","Four sets of films, with a quantity of 20 per set, were produced for anodization (1) Data Set 1-500 nm Al on a Si substrate, (2) Data Set 2\u2014500 nm Al\/40 nm Pt on a Si substrate; (3) Data Set 3\u2014500 nm Al\/40 nm Pt on Si with a heated substrate (T=200\u00b0 C.) and (4) Data Set 4\u2014500 nm Al\/8 nm Ti\/40 nm Pt on a Si substrate.","The anodization of the thin aluminum films in particular embodiments of the present invention may be executed in a jacketed glass reaction vessel that allows the electrolyte to be maintained at <5\u00b0 C. and vigorously agitated. The working electrode assembly exposes only the front metallized surface of the sample to the anodization environment and the voltage may be applied to the backside Al metal contact which is in metal\u2014metal contact with the Pt underlayer via wrap-around lead wires. The anodization conditions may be chosen, for example, from Masuda's work that listed potentiostatic anodization at 25 v DC with 0.5 M HSOat 10\u00b0 C. as the empirically determined optimal conditions for self-ordering and pore regularity in HSO, see Masuda, H., F.

The anodization reaction may be controlled by a digital acquisition system running LabVIEW\u00a9 which logs the anodization current and controls the applied voltage. During the anodization process, resolution of the current measurement is +\/\u22120.05 mAmps (95% CI) and the voltage measurement resolution is +\/\u221225 mV DC (95% CI) at a data collection frequency of 20 data points per second.",{"@attributes":{"id":"P-00093","num":"00093"},"figref":"FIG. 3","b":["300","302","304","306","308","310","312","314","314","304","316","318"]},"A cyclic voltammetry (CV) study established from an electrochemical standpoint the presence or absence of the alumina barrier layer. The CV scans were completed in a similar manner to the work of Serebrennikova, I., P. Vanysek, and V. I. Birss, Characterization of porous aluminum oxide films by metal electrodeposition, Electrochemical Acta, 1997, 42 (1): pp. 145-151, the entire contents and disclosure of which is hereby incorporated by reference. The electrolyte composition was 10 mM silver nitrate in neutral borate buffer (pH=6.7, \u03c3=4.31 mS) with a scan rate of 20 mV\/sec. A Gamry electrochemical workstation using a three electrode cell and a SCE reference electrode was used for the study. Three reference CV scans were completed to allow the curves to be interpreted. The first reference CV scan was completed with a 40 nm thin film of Pt on a Si substrate for determination of the location of silver oxidation\/stripping and reduction\/deposition peaks. The second reference CV scan was completed with nanoporous alumina formed on bulk Al (1 mm thick nominal) to establish the behavior of the barrier layer and demonstrate the absence of the anodic silver stripping peak due to rectification produced by the alumina barrier layer as observed in Serebrennikova, I., P. Vanysek, and V. I. Birss, Characterization of porous aluminum oxide films by metal electrodeposition, Electrochemical Acta, 1997, 42 (1): pp. 145-151, the entire contents and disclosure of which is hereby incorporated by reference. The bulk alumina template was anodized to the equivalent pore depth and diameter for all samples based oil experimentally determined anodization efficiencies. The third reference CV scan was completed with 8 nm Ti deposited on a 40 nm Pt with Si substrate. The thin film Ti on Pt was then converted to anodized TiOin 0.5 M HSO. The purpose of the TiOCV scan was to establish that the TiOsemiconductor electrode on Pt with a Si substrate demonstrated both a silver deposition peak and a silver stripping peak. All other CV curves in this application may be interpreted from these three reference curves.","The TiO-UV light study described herein compared the behavior of the anodically generated TiOlayer and the behavior of the Pt underlayer to illumination. The UV light generated by a Ushio high pressure mercury lamp with primary spectral lines at 436, 405 and 365 run was used to detect the presence or absence of anodically generated TiOas the active electrode material at the base of the pores. The impact of UV light was determined on both the open circuit potential (E) defined as the equilbrium condition and potentiostatic OER current defined as the kinetic condition. The electrolyte used was borate buffer at 25\u00b0 C. in a three electrode cell with a silver\/silver chloride (Ag\/AgCl) reference electrode and a platinum mesh counter electrode. The potentiostatic point for examination of the UV impact on the kinetics of the OER was chosen by determining the onset voltage of the OER using Tafel plots for the various samples. The UV illumination was controlled by a manually operated shutter with a cycle of 60 seconds off\/30 seconds on for a total of 6 cycles. Tight control on shutter opening and closing times are not critical to the results.","All micrographs were taken on a Hitachi SE-4500 FESEM with a SEMICAPS digital capture system.","The utility of thin film metal underlayers for anodization of aluminum thin films has been recently demonstrated using tantalum (Ta) by Vorobyova and Outkina, see Vorobyova, A. I. and E. A. Outkina, Study of pillar microstructure formation with anodic oxides, Thin Solid Films, 1998, 1-2 (Jul. 1, 1998): pp. 324, the entire contents and disclosure of which is hereby incorporated by reference, and titanium by Tatarenko and Solntsev, see Tatarenko, N. I., V. A. Solntseva, and A. N. Rodionov, Novel nanoscale field emission structures: Fabrication technology, experimental and calculated characteristics, Journal of Vacuum Science and Technology B, 1999, 17 (2): pp. 647-654, the entire contents and disclosure of which is hereby incorporated by reference. Vorobyova and Outkina created a thin film Al\u2014Ta bilayer by evaporating 300 nm Al on 50 nm tantalum (Ta) with a Si substrate. The Al layer was then: potentiostatically anodized in oxalic acid at 30 v DC. The structure of the alumina\/TaOinterface upon termination of the Al anodization reaction and subsequent voltage ramping showed interesting results. The barrier layer of the alumina is shown to electrochemically etch to completion leaving the alumina pores open to the TaOlayer. The mechanism that etches the alumina barrier layer is the same electric field assisted dissolution process () that allows steady state pore propagation in bulk Al anodization, see Thamida, S. K. and H. C. Chang, Nanoscale pore formation dynamics during aluminum anodization, Chaos, 2002, 12 (1): pp. 240-251, the entire contents and disclosure of which is hereby incorporated by reference. In , element  defines the oxide\/electrolyte interface and element  defines the metal\/oxide interface. Increasing the applied electric field across the alumina barrier layer via ramping the anodization voltage and simultaneously exhausting the supply of Al allows the dissolving oxide\/electrolyte interface to approach the metal\/oxide interface and ultimately eliminate the oxide barrier layer. The use of solitary Ta or Ti underlayers has a significant limitation for the present invention due to the fact that anodic tantalum pentoxide (TaO) and anodic titanium oxide (TiO) are relatively wide band gap semiconductors (E=4.3 eV and 3.1 eV, respectively) and therefore a relatively poor electrode material for subsequent electrochemical deposition into the nanoporous template. Platinum is widely regarded as having optimal electrode characteristics for electrochemical deposition of a wide variety of metals and semiconductors. Additionally, platinum electrodes and platinum oxidation are well studied in the literature, see Conway, B. E., Electrochemical oxide film formation at noble metals as a surface-chemical process, Progress in Surface Science, 1995, 49 (4): pp. 331-452, the entire contents and disclosure of which is hereby incorporated by reference. The oxidation of Pt to form platinum oxides has been demonstrated to quickly create a 2-D oxide layer which slowly uses a place exhange mechanism to form a true 3-D bulk oxide phase. Platinum oxides formed on Pt thin films have been demonstrated by a variety of researchers in the field to be reduced in acid environments common to aluminum anodization, see Tremiliosifilho, G., G. Jerkiewicz, and B. E. Conway, Characterization and significance of the sequence of stages of oxide film formation at Platinum generated by strong anodic polarization, Langmuir, 1992, 8 (2): pp. 658-667, the entire contents and disclosure of which is hereby incorporated by reference. However, use of Pt thin film electrodes in aqueous systems at high anodic potentials (exceeding 1.23 V vs. SHIE in acidic solutions) may be accompanied by a vigorous and undesirable OER. Therefore, use of platinum or other suitable metal as an underlayer in thin film anodization of aluminum to create a nanoporous alumina template with in situ removal of the barrier layer and avoiding or minimizing the subsequent OER through the use of a diffusion barrier is further discussed in the present invention.","Anodization behavior of thin film Al\u2014Pt bilayers on Si substrate: The curves illustrated in  demonstrate the typical anodization performance of three types of thin film systems discussed in the present invention. The curve labelled \u201cAl on Si\u201d represents the anodization behavior of 500 nm Al directly on a Si substrate (Data Set 1). The curve labelled \u201cAl\u2014Pt on Si\u201d represents the performance of 500 nm Al with a Pt underlayer on a Si substrate (Data Set 2). The curve labelled \u201cMultilayer on Si\u201d illustrates the performance of a multilayer template (Data Set 4). The curve labeled \u201cVoltage Ramp\u201d illustrates the applied voltage program for the anodization and is plotted against the second y-axis. For simplicity, the graph has been normalized to allow the anodization performance of the various thin film systems to be compared by inspection. The normalization of time was done by assigning the endpoint time of the various anodizations and scaling the elapsed anodization time by this endpoint. Anodization current was normalized by assigning the maximum current achieved before the anodization endpoint time and scaling all current values relative to this maximum anodization current.","The Al on Si system (Data Set 1) matches the published reports for bulk Al anodization with an initial drop in the current with normalized time<0.25, indicating the formation of a planar surface oxide layer at early anodization stages. This is followed by an increase in the current as pore nucleation begins with subsequent steady state pore growth. At the anodization endpoint, corresponding to normalized time=1, the Al thin film is completely consumed and the Si substrate at the interface becomes quickly converted to SiO. It is instructive to examine the primary sources of voltage drop in this system as shown by FIG. . Initially the voltage drop is largely across the scalloped alumina barrier layer during steady state pore growth (\u0394V). As the propagating interface approaches the silicon surface, the O and OH ions begin converting the Si to SiO. The current quickly decays to zero when the magnitude of the applied voltage approaches \u0394V, i.e. the voltage drop due to the growing SiOlayer. The alumina barrier layer is observed in FESEM images to be present and may be either concave or convex depending on the anodization conditions and corresponding electric field as described by Thamida, S. K. and H. C. Chang, Nanoscale pore formation dynamics during aluminum anodization, Chaos, 2002, 12 (1): pp. 240-251, the entire contents and disclosure of which is hereby incorporated by reference.","In contrast, the Al\u2014Pt on Si system (Data Set 2) illustrates substantially different behavior. The characteristic current dip indicative of the formation of a planar surface oxide layer is absent. Additionally, the pore initiation point is not clearly observable as in the Al\u2014Si system. The behavior of anodization current as the pore front nears the Pt interface differs remarkably as well. For the Al\u2014Pt on Si system prepared at ambient temperature in the e-beam evaporator, the current increases sharply as the propagating pore front nears the platinum interface. However, the sharp rise in current has been shown by FESEM examination not to corrolate with the endpoint of the aluminum anodization but rather to the acceleration of the OER. Ten anodized Al\u2014Pt bilayers on Si substrates were immediately stopped after the sharp increase in recorded anodization current (FIGS. A and B). In , layer  is alumina, layer  is Al\u2014Pt and layer  is platinum. Typically, a layer of unconverted metal approximately 30 nm thick was observed by FESEM between the advancing pore front and the platinum underlayer.","The unconverted layer highlighted in  is an indication of an amorphous Al\u2014Pt intermetallic system which may exist at compositions between 60-75 atomic % Al. The Al\u2014Pt reaction was first investigated by Comer, see Comer, J.

They found that Al\u2014Pt reacted rapidly near 250\u00b0 C. to form a variety of intermetallic species with the most stable of these being AlPt. Colgan et al., see Colgan, E.

Labar, and P. B. Barna, Diffusion coefficient of Al in metastable, amorphous Al\u2014Pt phase, Applied Physics Letters, 1998, 73 (22): pp. 3220-3222, the entire contents and disclosures of which are hereby incorporated by reference, examined the formation of voids in e-beam deposited Al\u2014Pt bilayers. Radi states the Al\u2014Pt reaction proceeded by first forming an initial layer of an amorphous Al\u2014Pt intermetallic followed by a crystalline AlPtcompound at substrate temperatures exceeding 120\u00b0 C. Since Al has been determined to be the fast diffusing component in the Al\u2014Pt system, the characteristic voids, i.e. Kirkendall voids, see Radi, Z., P. B. Barna, and J. Labar, Kirkendall voids and the formation of amorphous phase in the Al\u2014Pt thin film system prepared by high temperature successive deposition, Journal of Applied Physics, 1996, 79 (8): pp. 4096-4100, the entire contents and disclosure of which is hereby incorporated by reference, may be observed in the aluminum layer immediately adjacent to the growing intermetallic system. The rapid growth of these voids indicates that the source of Al diffusion is preferentially the void surface, transported by the facile surface diffusion mechanism. The ambient substrate temperature used in embodiments of the present invention was estimated to achieve temperatures between 100-150\u00b0 C. during condensation of metals onto the Si substrate, thereby creating the Al\u2014Pt intermetallics at the interface and the observed void layers.","In order to illustrate the impact of Al\u2014Pt intermetallics on the anodization of thin film aluminum, an Al\u2014Pt bilayer (Data Set 3) was deposited with the Si substrate heated to 200\u00b0 C., which significantly enhanced the formation of the intermetallics and the voids in the aluminum layer.  shows three distinct metal layers: 25 nm Pt layer, 40 mm Al\u2014Pt intermetallic layer, and 150 run Al layer on silicon.  illustrates the pore system that developed during the anodization. The contrasting anodization behavior of Data Sets 2 and 3 are shown in FIG. .","Both the micrographs and the anodization behavior of Data Sets 2 and 3 support the conclusion that Al\u2014Pt intermetallics formed by physical vapor deposition of Al\u2014Pt bilayers at either ambient temperature or 200\u00b0 C. enhance the OER and mask the anodization endpoint of the aluminum. However, if the anodization and OER is allowed to proceed well past the large current jump observed at 2000 seconds elapsed time, an anodization endpoint may be identified: using signal processing techniques. The FESEM examination of these extended anodization samples showed two critical features: existence of an oxide barrier layer and a misshapen porous structure at the alumina-Pt interface due to the Al\u2014Pt intermetallic region.","The existence of the barrier layer at the interface after the anodization endpoint for Al\u2014Pt thin films may be explained by examining the location of the most significant voltage drops. During the steady state pore propagation far from the Pt interface, the primary voltage drop in the system is developed across the alumina barrier layer (\u0394V) as shown in FIG. . As the propagating pore front approaches the Pt interface, the observed current becomes divided between the Al anodization reaction and the OER. Initially the voltage drop associated with the OER and subsequent diffusion of participant species (\u0394V) is approximately two orders of magnitude lower than \u0394V. A large peak in the current may be observed, as Pt rich sites within the intermetallic region become electrical conduction paths in the oxidized\/anodized Al\u2014Pt intermetallic system. This reduction in \u0394Vproduces two effects. Firstly, the reduced \u0394Vslows the rate of aluminum anodization and attempts to reduce the radius of curvature of the propagating pore base. Secondly, the remaining applied voltage enables a vigorous OER developing a diffusion gradient of participant species within the pore. The OER continues to accelerate within the intermetallic region due to more Pt sites becoming available as anodization of the Al\u2014Pt intermetallic continues. Hence, the concentration overpotential for this reaction initially increases sharply followed by a slower stabilization to an equilibrium value. Ultimately, the observed current is distributed between the field limited Al anodization reaction and the diffusion limited OER. This significantly slows the rate of pore propagation towards the platinum interface. The alumina barrier layer remains in place due to this distribution of current and the inability to produce the necessary electric field strength to continue field assisted dissolution at the oxide\/electrolyte interface regardless of subsequent applied voltage ramping.","A high degree of supersaturation of dissolved oxygen in the nanopore results from the accelerated OER occurring at Pt rich sites within the intermetallic region. According to Yang, Y., et al, Anodic alumina template on Au\/Si substrate and preparation of CdS nanowires, Solid State Communications, 2002, 123 (2002): pp. 279-282, the entire contents and disclosure of which is hereby incorporated by reference, the nucleation of oxygen bubbles inside the nanopore produces a subsequent decline of the OER rate due to the pores filling with oxygen bubbles. However, this effect has not been observed in the present invention. In fact, the small radii of the nanopores (10 nm) is below the experimentally determined critical nucleation radius of 35 nm in 10 \u03bcm diameter silica glass capillaries where the applied oxygen supersaturation pressure was 15 MPa as determined by Brereton, G. J., R. J. Crilly, and J. R. Spears, Nucleation in small capillary tubes, Chemical Physics, 1998, 230 (1998): pp. 253-265, the entire contents and disclosure of which is hereby incorporated by reference. The threshold of heterogeneous nucleation as measured by the oxygen supersaturation pressure was found to have the following relationship: \n\n\nThus, as a first approximation for rapproaching the pore radius (10 nm), the supersaturation pressure of oxygen in the nanopore may be estimated to be on the order of 160 MPa. This high pressure would be very difficult to achieve inside the pore with no imposed hydrodynamic flow except diffusional flow. Therefore, the most likely scenario is that the OER occurs at the base of the pore with diffusional flow of supersaturated oxygen along the length of the pore and subsequent bubble nucleation at the pore exit. The bubbles of oxygen continue to grow until body forces of the bubble overcome the attraction to the alumina surface and detach. Thus, cyclically interrupting current paths on the electrode and changing the effective surface area creates the observed noise in the current.\n","Development of the multilayer thin film system: It is clear that simple Al\u2014Pt bilayers will not produce the desired nanoporous template. Therefore a multilayer thin film system on Si substrate has been provided by the present invention comprising at least three layers. The first layer is the Pt underlayer that serves as the \u201cactive\u201d electrode for subsequent DC electrodeposition of materials into the nanopore. The second layer is a thin Film \u201cvalve metal\u201d (e.g., Ta, Ti, niobium (Nb), zirconium (Zr)) that serves as a diffusion barrier between the Pt underlayer and the Al top layer. The top-most layer is e-beam deposited as Al and later converted via anodization to the nanoporous alumina. The \u201cvalve metal\u201d diffusion barrier preferably has the following characteristics, (1) the ability to deposit the barrier material of choice in the same physical vapor deposition device as Al and Pt layers, (2) limited intermetallic formation with Al and Pt layers at ambient substrate temps with good mechanical adhesion characteristics, (3) an anodization product of the barrier layer material that is stable and may selectively be removed at the pore centers by an in situ technique, and (4) an anodization product of the barrier layer preferably supresses the OER to allow field driven barrier layer removal of alumina at pore bases.","The present invention provides an in situ approach to forming a multilayer thin film based nanoporous alumina template by inducing the selective removal of a barrier layer, particularly by an avalanche breakdown mechanism created by the ramping of the applied voltage. This removes the barrier layer materials only at the base of the alumina pores and leaves the remaining material intact, hence exposing the underlying electrode layer for further use. This electrode has the characteristic that it may immediately participate in electrochemical deposition reactions without the requirement of further processing.","The present invention also provides control of the barrier layer characteristics of the alumina via controlling, or minimizing, the OER reaction during anodization and hence the electric field at the base of the pores. The OER reaction may be controlled by using a suitable diffusion layer.","A preferable diffusion barrier for the present invention is Ti, which has been shown by the present invention to achieve all four requirements. A schematic of the multilayer thin film system with a Ti barrier layer after aluminum anodization and subsequent voltage ramping is shown in FIG. . Multilayer thin film system  comprises alumina layer , TiOlayer , Pt layer , Si substrate , and Al contact layer .","Pt\u2014Ti thin film bilayers have been examined for application as electrodes for non-volatile ferroelectric RAM devices, see Hwang, Y. S., et al., The effect of Al\/Pt interface reaction on lead-zirconate-titanate capacitor and the optimization of via contact for double metal ferroelectric RAM, Japanese Journal of Applied Physics: Part 1, 1998, 37 (3 B): pp. 1332-1335, the entire contents and disclosure of which is hereby incorporated by reference. According to the Pt\u2014Ti phase diagram the following phases may exist: PtTi, PtTi, PtTi and \u03b3-phase PtTi, see Murray, J. L., The Pt\u2014Ti binary phase diagram-ASM Handbook, Binary Alloy Phase Diagrams, 1982, 2: pp. 1915-1916, the entire contents and disclosure of which is hereby incorporated by reference. However Lee et al. found only the PtTi phase in existence in thin film bilayer systems, see Lee, C. K., C. D. Hsieh, and B. H. Tseng, Effects of titanium interlayer on the formation of platinum silicides, Thin Solid Films, 1997, 303 (1997): pp. 232-237, the entire contents and disclosure of which is hereby incorporated by reference. The formation temperature of the PtTi phase is reported to the approximately 500\u00b0 C. by Park, K. H., et al., Microstructures and interdiffusion of Pt\/Ti electrodes with respect to annealing in oxygen ambient, Journal of Materials Research, 1995, 10 (7): pp. 1790-1794, the entire contents and disclosure of which is hereby incorporated by reference. Kweon examined the interdiffusion of Ti into Pt and resulting hillock formation in sputtered Pt\u2014Ti films, sec Kweon, S. Y., et al., Platinum hillocks in Pt\u2014Ti film stacks deposited on thermally oxidized Si substrate, Japanese Journal of Applied Physics: Part 1, 2001, 40 (2001): pp. 5850-5855, the entire contents and disclosure of which is hereby incorporated by reference. Kweon reports that as-deposited samples (200 nm Pt\/20 nm Ti on Si) with a substrate temperature of 500\u00b0 C. showed no measurable intermixing as determined by Auger Electron Spectroscopy (AES). In fact, the bilayers are typically annealed at 400\u00b0 C. for 30 additional minutes before a measurable amount of diffused Ti is found in the Pt layer. In addition, Al\u2014Ti thin film systems have been examined for the reduction of electromigration of Al in integrated circuit metallizatons. Of the possible Al\u2014Ti compounds, AlTi is the most thermodynamically stable, T=350\u00b0 C., and is most often observed in thin film bilayers as reported by Colgan, E. G. and J. W. Mayer, Thin-film reactions of Al with Co, Cr, Mo, Ta, Ti and W, Journal of Materials Research, 1989, 4 (4): pp. 815-820; and Colgan, E. G., A review of thin film aluminide formation, Material Science Reports, 1990, 5 (1990): pp. 1-44, the entire contents and disclosures of which are hereby incorporated by reference. Aluminum is the fast diffusing species of the couple and at substrate temps<150\u00b0 C. the relatively slow diffusion of Al will preferentially occur along Ti grain boundaries and thereby reduce the rate of Al\u2014Pt intermetallic formation compared to a bulk Al\u2014Pt interface. Therefore, the literature on Pt\u2014Ti and Al\u2014Ti bilayers is consistent with its use as a diffusion barrier for the Al\u2014Pt thin film depositions.","Of the possible candidate valve metals, metals such as Ti and Ta are preferable to deposit by e-beam evaporation. For example, tantalum has been shown to significantly suppress the OER during anodization, see Laleko, V. L., L. L. Odynets, and T. L. Voitenko, Electrical conductivity of anodic tantalum oxide films in contact with al electrolyte, Russian Journal of Electrochemistry, 1994, 30 (6): pp. 718-719, the entire contents and disclosure of which is hereby incorporated by reference. However, the effective band gap of anodically formcd tantalum oxide is 4.3 eV vs. 3.2 eV for anodic titanium oxide, see Schultze, J. W. and M. M. Lohrengel, Stability, reactivity and breakdown of passive films. Problems of recent and future research, Electrochimica Acta, 2000, 45 (2000): pp. 2499-2513, the entire contents and disclosure of which is hereby incorporated by reference. Therefore, it requires significantly more applied voltage to achieve the threshold current for mechanical and electrical breakdown of tantalum oxide. Due to power supply limitations, the lower voltage breakdown characteristics of titanium are preferred for the present invention. Using Sul's results for sulfuric acid, see Sul, Y. T., et al., The electrochemical oxide growth behavior on titanium in acid and alkaline electrolytes, Medical and Engineering Physics, 2001, 23 (2001): pp. 329-346, the entire contents and disclosure of which is hereby incorporated by reference, the required anodization voltage for complete conversion of the deposited thin film Ti layer is approximately 8 v DC with an anodization rate of 20 nm\/sec. Hence the anodization of the 8 nm Ti thin film to a 16 nm anodically generated titanium oxide layer is easily accomplished by the Al anodization potential of 25 v DC in under a second.","The anodization endpoint is clearly visible in  for the sample labeled \u201cMultilayer on Si\u201d with a sharp decline in reaction current at the normalized endpoint value. This mulltilayer sample demonstrates a major processing improvement with a post-anodization OER current of less than 2 mAmps\/cm. Therefore the applied voltage ramp increases the electric field across both the titanium oxide and the alumina barrier layer without creating a large increase in the concentration overpotential inside the pore associated with the OER (\u0394V). According to Thamida, S. K. and H. C. Chang, Nanoscale pore formation dynamics during aluminum anodization, Chaos, 2002, 12 (1): pp. 240-251, the entire contents and disclosure of which is hereby incorporated by reference, the mechanism of alumina pore development is described as a coupled moving boundary problem where the local electric field strengths found across the alumina barrier layer dictate the movement of the oxide\/electrolyte interface and the metal\/oxide interface. The oxide\/electrolyte interface dissolves the alumina formed at the metal\/oxide interface due to the field focusing effect of the scalloped shaped pore front during steady state propagation. Therefore, if the supply of aluminum is consumed, the metal\/oxide interface propagation may terminate and the oxide\/electrolyte interface may stay at equilibrium thickness at a constant applied field. By ramping the voltage, the applied electric field across the alumina barrier layer may be increased to allow continued dissolution and movement of the oxide\/electrolyte interface towards the stationary metal\/oxide interface as shown in FIG. . Thus, the alumina barrier layer is removed incrementally during the voltage ramp. This has been verified experimentally by FESEM examination of ramped vs. non-ramped samples. Likewise, Voroboyova found similar voltage ramping requirements for barrier layer removal with tantalum oxide pillars, see Vorobyova, A. I. and E. A. Outkina, Study of pillar microstructure formation with anodic oxides, Thin Solid Films, 1998, 1-2 (Jul. 1, 1998): p. 324, the entire contents and disclosure of which is hereby incorporated by reference, and Tatarenko with titanium oxide pillars, see Tatarenko, N. I., V. A. Solntseva, and A. N. Rodionov, Novel nanoscale field emission structures: Fabrication technology, experimental and calculated characteristics, Journal of Vacuum Science and Technology B, 1999, 17 (2): pp. 647-654, the entire contents and disclosure of which is hereby incorporated by reference.","As the pore front approaches the Ti layer, the migration of O and OH ions through the alumina barrier layer anodizes the Ti thin film. The anodization product of titanium with the previously stated anodization conditions has been shown by Delplancke, J. L. and R. Winand, Galvanostatic anodization of Titanium-I, Structures and compositions of the anodic films, Electrochimica Acta, 1988, 33 (11): pp. 1539-1549, the entire contents and disclosure of which is hereby incorporated by reference, to produce largely crystalline TiOin both anatase and rutile phases. The removal of TiOfrom the platinum electrode follows a modified anodic breakdown mechanism. The vast literature on the subject of anodic breakdown of oxides during anodization assumes the effective electric field is constant within the oxide. Additionally, the growing oxide thickness and the flux of ionic species are critical parameters in the breakdown process. An important aspect of the anodic breakdown is the injection of current from the electrolyte via the redox reaction occurring at the oxide\/electrolyte interface. In the present invention, the redox reaction providing current injection is the OER. In contrast, metal-insulator-metal structures have a constant oxide thickness and the voltage is ramped producing an increase in the applied electric field. Hence, the titanium oxide layer behavior in the present invention may be described as a combination of these previously studied oxide systems with an electrolyte electrode, a fixed titanium oxide thickness, a redox reaction at the oxide\/electrolyte interface and the ramping of the applied electric field. As stated by Tsuda, N., et al., Electronic Conduction in Oxides, Springer Series in Solid-State Sciences, ed. M. Cardona and P. Fulde, Vol. 94, 1991, Berlin: Springer-Verlag, the entire contents and disclosure of which is hereby incorporated by reference, the conductivity of transition metal oxides (e.g., CrO, NbO, TiO) is governed by electrical conduction at 298K. Therefore, the data relating to the breakdown of the TiOlayer will be interpreted according to Ikonopisov's model for avalanche breakdown, see Albella, J. M., I. Montero, and J. M. Martinez-Duart, A theory of avalanche breakdown during anodic oxidation, Electrochimica Acta, 1987, 32 (2): pp. 255-258; and Albella, J. M., et al., Dielectric breakdown processes in anodic TaOand related oxides: A Review, Journal of Materials Science, 1991, 26 (1991): pp. 3422-3432, the entire contents and disclosures of which are hereby incorporated by reference. According to this model and specifically for the case of TiO, the primary electronic current is injected from the electrolyte into the oxide valence hand as shown in FIG. . The high field strength existing within the oxide may accelerate these injected electrons to an energy that is sufficient to free secondary electrons by impact ionization. Hence, an avalanche may occur when a critical threshold current is reached causing electrical and subsequent mechanical breakdown. This typical avalanche behavior is displayed by both \u201cMultilayer Sample 1\u201d and \u201cMultilayer Sample 2\u201d in FIG. . One observation common to the avalanche mechanism is the reproducibility of breakdown voltages between samples within similar experimental conditions while the threshold current is known to vary.  illustrates the details of the TiObreakdown behavior highlighting the characteristic voltage-current oscillations. Post-anodization removal of the alumina via chemical etch, and imaging with FESEM, clearly shows that the Ti oxide layer was preferentially removed from the corresponding alumina pore centers. The preferential etching of the TiOat the pore centers is controlled by the alumina template. The applied voltage across both the TiOand alumina pore wall is distributed such that dV\/dx is small because dx is large (z 750 nm). This is not the case at the pore centers, which have incrementally removed the alumina barrier layer. The dV\/dx is large because while dV remains constant, dx is now much smaller (\u224815 nm).","Analysis of the OER behavior before and after TiOremoval: Additional strong evidence for removal of the titanium oxide at the pore centers is the significant change in the Tafel-type slope immediately preceding and following the breakdown of the TiOlayer.  shows the change in the electrode behavior. The Tafel-type slope is observed to change by a factor of 3 within +\/\u22121.5 volts of the breakdown voltage. The interpretation of this data requires considering the nature of the semiconducting properties of TiOand the classical Butler-Volmer electrochemical kinetics, see Bard, A. J. and L. R. Faulkner, Electrochemical Methods: Fundamentals and Applications, Second ed. 2001, New York: John Wiley and Sons, 833, the entire contents and disclosure of which is hereby incorporated by reference. The OER occurring on the multilayer electrode displays Tafel-type behavior tip to 40 mAmps\/cmand mass-transfer limited behavior beyond this current. Using the Butler-Volmer model, the anodic slope of the redox reaction is (1\u2212\u03b1)F\/2.3RT, where the transfer coefficient (\u03b1) is a function of both the redox reaction occurring and the electrode surface involved. For metallic electrodes within the Tafel kinetically dominated region, it is observed that 0.3<\u03b1<0.7 due to the applied potential drop occurring primarily in the Helmholtz region of the double layer. As discussed in the present invention, bulk n-type TiO(E=3.2 eV) produced by anodization, has electron bands pinned at the electrode\/electrolyte interface by the existence of surface states and the strong interaction with water. As shown by Memming for bulk semiconductors, band pinning produces a space charge and subsequent depletion layer within the semiconductor when the Fermi level of the redox reaction (E) falls within the band gap of the semiconductor (E), see Memming, R., Semiconductor Electrochemistry, 1998, Wiley-VCH: Weinheim, p. 394, the entire contents and disclosure of which is hereby incorporated by reference. As a result of this space charge behavior, semiconductor electrodes have typical values of \u03b1 close to 1. As described in the present invention, it is recognized that the 20 nm nominal TiOlayer may be too thin to support a space charge layer and thus be dominated by interface kinetics as described by Lindquist, S. E., et al., Charge transport in nanostructured thin-film electrodes, in Electrochemistry of Nanomaterials, G. Hodes, Editor, 2001, Wiley-VCH: Weinheim, p. 310, the entire contents and disclosure of which is hereby incorporated by reference. Despite the origin of the TiOelectrode characteristics, a change in the slope of the Tafel-type behavior within +\/\u22121.5 volts of the observed breakdown peak strongly suggests a change in electrode characteristics. There are two potential causes of this observed change in the transfer coefficient. The first possibility is the electrical\/mechanical breakdown of the TiOlayer directly exposing the Pt underlayer to the electrolyte at the pore bases. The second possibility as described by Horrocks, B. R., M. V. Mirkin, and A. J. Bard, Scanning Electrochemical Microscopy: 25, Application to investigation of the kinetics of heterogeneous electron transfer at semiconductor (WeSe2 and Si) electrodes, Journal of Physical Chemistry, 1994, 98 (37): pp. 9106-9114, the entire contents and disclosure of which is hereby incorporated by reference, is the onset of electronic carrier degeneracy as the Eis approached by either the pinned conduction band surface states or valance band surface states (Eor E) in order to eliminate one of these two possibilities, an OER-UV light study was conducted and is discussed below.","Electrochemical analysis of alumina barrier layer removal: Direct FESEM examination of the barrier layer was difficult due to the lack of contrast and charging behavior of alumina and the TiOsub-layer. Thus, an electrochemical means of verifying the presence or absence of the alumina barrier layer to help interpret the FESEM images may be utilized. Cyclic voltammetry was identified as the most straightforward electro-analytical technique due to the electrical conduction properties of the alumina barrier layer and the relative ease of peak interpretation.","Serebrennikova et al. employed a cyclic voltammetry technique in studying the electrochemical deposition of metals into nanoporous alumina, see Serebrennikova, I., P. Vanysek, and V. I. Birss, Characterization of porous aluminum oxide films by metal electrodeposition, Electrochemical Acta, 1997, 42 (1): pp. 145-151, the entire contents and disclosure of which is hereby incorporated by reference. The redox couple employed was Ag\/Ag in dilute HSOor borate buffer solution. Serebrennikova et al. showed that both anodically generated planar and porous alumina produced a rectification in the CV scans of the silver redox couple. To confirm the utility of this electrochemical approach, the CV behavior of three reference samples were examined as part of the present invention. The first reference sample was a thin film Pt on Si substrate for determination of peak location of the silver redox couple. The second reference sample was nanoporous alumina formed on bulk Al foil. As stated in the experimental CV discussion above, the bulk alumina template was anodized to the equivalent pore depth and diameter of the thin film based samples. The purpose of this anodized bulk Al reference sample was to establish the behavior of the alumina barrier layer and demonstrate the absence of the anodic silver stripping peak due to rectification produced by the barrier layer as observed in Serebrennikova, I., P. Vanysek, and V. I. Birss, Characterization of porous aluminum oxide films by metal electrodeposition, Electrochemical Acta, 1997, 42 (1): pp. 145-151, the entire contents and disclosure of which is hereby incorporated by reference. The third reference sample was an anodically converted 15 nm TiOfrom e-beam deposited 8 run Ti with Pt underlayer on Si substrate. The Pt\/Si and the anodized Ti\/Pt\/Si reference samples demonstrated an anodic stripping peak as well as a cathodic deposition peak with the TiOcreating approximately a +\/\u2212100 mV shift in peak location vs. the Pt thin film electrode. Hence, the absence of the silver anodic stripping peak was found to be unique to the presence of an alumina barrier layer at the pore bases. It is important to emphasize that the silver CV approach does riot discern between the absence and presence of a TiOlayer at the pore bases as currently applied due to the noisy behavior of the nanoporous electrodes.","Five types of samples as described in the cyclic voltammetry experimental section above and displayed in three figures (,  and ) are summarized here to understand the impact of voltage ramping on the alumina barrier layer. ,  and  show 30 nm Pt on Si substrate (CV Sample 1); anodically generated 15 nm TiO\/30 nm Pt on Si (CV Sample 2); an unramped multilayer sample (CV Sample 3); a ramped to completion multilayer sample (CV Sample 4); and bulk alumina with pore depth held constant (CV Sample 5). ,  and  summarize the CV findings.",{"@attributes":{"id":"P-00119","num":"00119"},"figref":["FIG. 15","FIG. 15"],"sub":["2","3","4","4"],"sup":["\u2212","2\u2212","2\u2212"]},{"@attributes":{"id":"P-00120","num":"00120"},"figref":["FIG. 16","FIGS. 15 and 16"],"b":"16"},{"@attributes":{"id":"P-00121","num":"00121"},"figref":"FIG. 17","b":"17"},"Compiling the results from ,  and , it is clear that ramped and unramped multilayer samples behave very differently. Ramped multilayer samples display both an anodic stripping peak and a cathodic deposition peak with only minimal shift in peak location as compared to a thin film Pt reference sample or the TiO\/Pt reference sample. The unramped multilayer sample CV results closely match the bulk alumina reference sample both in terms of the absence of the anodic stripping peak due to barrier layer rectification and the hysteresis\/polarization effect observed in the cathodic portion of the scan. The cathodic peak shift and the magnitude of the hysteresis based polarization effects for the bulk alumina sample vs. the unramped multilayer sample are most likely due to the observed alumina barrier layer thinning in the thin film based sample vs. the bulk alumina reference sample. Based on the above CV information, it may be stated that the ramping of \u0394Vin the anodization program is shown to remove the alumina barrier layer from an electrochemical CV standpoint.","Examination of the TiOlayer via OER-UV light mechanism: The presence of the TiOlayer as the active electrode material at the pore bases is examined by the present invention by illuminating the working electrode with UV light and recording the resulting impact of EHP generation in the semiconductor electrode (TiO). Two complimentary approaches are analyzed. The first is an equilibrium approach where the impact of UV light on the open circuit potential (E) is measured with reference to an Ag\/AgCl reference electrode. The second is a kinetic approach, where the electrochemical cell is polarized to the onset of the OER in an aqueous based borate buffer solution and the UV light is cycled while the change in current is monitored.","The impact of UV light on the OER at a bulk single crystal TiOsemiconductor electrode was first studied by Fujishima, A. and K. Honda, Electrochemical photolysis of water at a semiconductor electrode, Nature, 1972, 238 (July 7): pp. 37-8, the entire contents and disclosure of which is hereby incorporated by reference. The reaction mechanism discussed in Fujishima's study of the TiO-Pt water photo-hydrolysis has been recently reexamined by Bak, T., et al., Photo-electrochemical properties of the TiO-Pt system in aqueous solutions, International Journal of Hydrogen Energy, 2002, 27 (2002): pp. 19-26, the entire contents and disclosure of which is hereby incorporated by reference.  displays the OER mechanism in the dark\/short circuited state showing the equivalence of the Fermi Level (E) in the semiconductor and the Fermi Level (E) of the redox couple as described by the Gerischer Model of electrolytes, see Memming, R., Semiconductor Electrochemistry, 1998, Wiley-VCH: Weinheim, p. 394, the entire contents and disclosure of which is hereby incorporated by reference. For the open circuit behavior of an n-type TiOsemiconductor electrode, the anodic exchange current (jo) is due to the availability of thermally generated holes, and the equivalent cathodic exchange current (jo) is due to surface states, tunneling and various flaws allowing electron transfer to the conduction band. When the sample is first illuminated in the open circuit condition, there is a brief transient response of hole dominated flow to the interface while electron flow is limited by the conduction band bending and hence the resulting voltage barrier (V) at the interface. This builds a positive charge that lowers Vuntil electrons can reach the surface at the same rate as holes. The net effect of this lowering of Vis the Emoves down on the energy axis relative to E. However, at the Pt metal electrode, there is negligible change due to illumination if the localized heating effects of the solution are factored out. Thus, the voltage measured by the equilibrium Eexperiment is E\u2212E(Ag\/AgCl) as a function of UV light illumination and therefore EHP generation.","The kinetic approach allows the ratio of thermally generated minority carriers to light-induced generation of minority carriers to be measured via the change in OER reaction current upon illumination. According to the Schottky barrier model, the applied potential creates both a \u0394\u03c6within the Helmholtz layer of the double layer and \u0394\u03c6within the space charge layer near the electrode interface, see Memming, R., Semiconductor Electrochemistry, 1998, Wiley-VCH: Weinheim, p. 394, the entire contents and disclosure of which is hereby incorporated by reference. While \u0394\u03c6is essentially constant for non-degenerate semiconductors, it is the \u0394\u03c6that drives the degree of band bending in the semiconductor electrode and hence the relative concentrations of charge carriers. For minority carrier reactions, the holes generated by light within the space charge region are driven toward the interface by the electric field and transferred across the interface. The rate of hole transfer across the interface is proportional to the photocurrent. Thus, this kinetic experiment examines the working electrode's sensitivity to UV-light via EHP generation and subsequent efficiency of charge carrier transfer to the electrolyte.","Lindquist et al., see Lindquist, S. E., B. Finnstrom, and L. Tegner, Photoelectrochemical properties of polycryslalline TiOthin film electrodes on quartz substrate, Journal of the Electrochemical Society, 1983, 130 (2): pp. 351-358, the entire contents and disclosure of which is hereby incorporated by reference, examined the photoelectrochemical properties of polycrystalline TiOthin film electrodes on quartz substrates and determined the validity of the space charge mechanism (Schottky barrier model) as a function of semiconductor electrode thickness. Although, the furnace oxidized TiOwas found to have high donor concentrations and space charge layer thickness to total oxide thickness ratios in the range of 0.11-0.14 (w\/d), the Schottky Barrier model and thus the optical behavior as predicted by the Gartner-Butler expression, see Lindquist, S. E., et al., Charge transport in nanostructured thin-film electrodes, in Electrochemistry of Nanomaterials, G. Hodes, Editor, 2001, Wiley-VCH: Weinheim. p. 310, the entire contents and disclosure of which is hereby incorporated by reference, was found to breakdown as the thickness of the TiOlayer became smaller than 40 nin. Flat band behavior and interface kinetics were demonstrated to dominate the optical behavior of TiOelectrodes with a thickness less than 35 nm. The charge transport mechanisms operating in this regime are reviewed by Lindquist, S. E., et al., Charge transport in nanostructured thin-film electrodes, in Electrochemistry of Nanomaterials, G. Hodes, Editor, 2001, Wiley-VCH: Weinheim. p. 310, the entire contents and disclosure of which is hereby incorporated by reference, and described transport mainly in terms of charge diffusional gradients and carrier lifetimes. Therefore, the thin TiOdiffusion layer (d\u224820 nm) present in the present invention most closely follows the mechanisms described by Lindquist. However, the bulk space charge model of semiconductors allows more intuitive insight into the OER-UV light interaction and its applicability in determining the characteristics of the working electrodes under study. The bulk space charge layer argument vs. the flat band mechanism does not change the net result of a specific OER-UV light interaction for TiOelectrodes.","Four samples were used in both the Eand the kinetic OER-UV light analysis: (1) Sample ID: Ramp 1\u2014no voltage ramping-potentiostatic anodization; (2) Ramp 2\u2014voltage ramped pre-breakdown of TiOlayer; (3) Ramp 3\u2014voltage ramped post-breakdown of TiOlayer; and (4) Pt Electrode\u2014thin film Pt on Si substrate.",{"@attributes":{"id":"P-00128","num":"00128"},"figref":["FIG. 19","FIG. 19","FIG. 20"],"sub":["OC","OC ","OC ","OC ","OC ","OC ","2"]},"The kinetic behavior is shown in  normalized by the equivalent procedure as described above for the E, data. Again, it may be observed that sample Ramp 2 displays the highest degree of relative enhancement of the OER rate upon illumination. Samples Ramp 1 and 3 show relative changes of reaction rate with UV illumination comparable to the Pt electrode sample.  shows the detrended stochastic residuals as calculated by the Moussa and Cheema method described above. The application of the central limit theorem and fitting a bounding Gaussian distribution allows the determination of statistically significant OER-UV light interaction beyond thermal solution effects. The sample Ramp 2 is not bounded by the Gaussian distribution toward the tails. Samples Ramp 1, Ramp 3 and the Pt electrode are contained within the bounding Gaussian and therefore have no statistically significant interaction with UV light beyond thermal solution effects.","Summarizing the OER-UV light results, it is clear that the multilayer samples respond differently to UV light as a function of the applied voltage within the voltage ramping program. The OER-UV light results suggest that the multilayer template is statistically most sensitive to UV light in the region just prior to the observed current oscillations (sample Ramp 2) shown in  indicating the breakdown of the thin TiOlayer. The subsequent reduction in UV light sensitivity shown by sample Ramp 3, post-breakdown, suggests that the working electrode material at the base of the pores is no longer TiO. Thus, the OER-UV light study in conjunction with the observed current oscillations during the voltage ramping program discussed in the present invention and the change in Tafel-type slope of the OER discussed in the present invention are all consistent with removal of TiOthrough an avalanche breakdown mechanism with exposure of the Pt underlayer as a working electrode material.","The present invention provides an understanding as to how a nanoporous alumina template may be engineered to have the desired characteristics for subsequent electrochemical deposition of nanowires. This is achieved through the use of a multilayer thin film based precursor on an arbitrary substrate. In order to most efficiently achieve the goal of creating a Pt electrode at the pore bases, the electrically insulating alumina barrier layer intrinsically created by the anodization process may be removed in situ. Previous experimental work, see O'Sullivan, J. P. and G. C.

Rodionov, Novel nanoscale field emission structures: Fabrication technology, experimental and calculated characteristics, Journal of Vacuum Science and Technology B, 1999, 17 (2): pp. 647-6546, the entire contents and disclosure of which are hereby incorporated by reference, examined the dynamics of the alumina barrier layer and established that through the applied voltage, the electric field present in the alumina barrier layer governed the resulting anodic alumina characteristics. This was cast in more formal mathematical terms by Thamida, S. K. and H. C. Chang, Nanoscale pore formation dynamics during aluminum anodization, Chaos, 2002, 12 (1): pp. 240-251, the entire contents and disclosure of which is hereby incorporated by reference, which advanced a fundamental understanding of the parameters governing the metal\/oxide interface and oxide\/electrolyte interface propagation. Pore depth is readily controllable through the thickness of the available thin film Al precursor deposited on the substrate and pore diameter by the applied voltage. However, in order to achieve an in sites generated Pt electrode at the pore bases, the electric field across the alumina barrier layer after the endpoint of alumina anodization must be controllable. Therefore, the problems of Al\u2014Pt intermetallic formation and Pt-catalyzed OER was recognized and solved in the present invention. The multilayer template described herein using a thin film Ti diffusion barrier has been demonstrated to achieve the goals of the present invention. E-beam deposited Ti was shown to have the following four characteristics: (1) the ability to deposit the barrier material of choice in the same physical vapor deposition device as Al and Pt layers; (2) limited intermetallic formation with Al and Pt layers at ambient substrate temperatures with good mechanical adhesion characteristics; (3) an anodization product of the barrier layer material that is stable and may selectively be removed at the pore centers by an in situ technique; and (4) an anodization product of the barrier layer preferably supresses the OER to allow the field driven barrier layer removal of alumina at pore bases.","Multiple analytical techniques were used to examine and verify the anodization behavior of the multilayer template. The CV study of the silver redox couple, in a similar manner to Serebrennikova, I., P. Vanysek, and V. I. Birss, Characterization of porous aluminum oxide films by metal electrodeposition, Electrochemical Acta, 1997, 42 (1): pp. 145-151, the entire contents and disclosure of which is hereby incorporated by reference, demonstrated electrochemically that the voltage ramping program allowed for incrementally removing: the alumina barrier layer but did not determine the absence or presence of TiOat the pore bases. The removal of TiOat the pore bases was established by: (1) avalanche breakdown current oscillations observed during the voltage ramping program; (2) the sharp change in Tafel-type slope of the OER before and after the TiObreakdown; (3) the UV-OER response observed both from equilibrium EOC and kinetic polarized OER approaches demonstrating pre-breakdown samples to be the only samples from the data set showing statistically significant UV-OER interaction; (4) the UV-OER data reduction analysis and statistical deviation from the bounding Gaussian behavior for pre-breakdown samples showing statistically significant UV light interaction that exceeds thermal solution effects; and (5) the FESEM examination of the anodized multilayer samples terminated at various points within the anodization program demonstrates the evolution and removal of the alumina barrier layer and TiOlayer.","The thin film based multilayer template described by the present invention has been shown to achieve the goal of an optimum nanostructured template for subsequent electrochemical deposition of nanowire materials. The present invention may be extending into various related areas by one of ordinary skill in the art, such as substituting an optically transparent, electrically conductive material (i.e. ITO) for the Pt underlayer or integration of silicon-based circuitry with the nanostructured material.","Application to biosensors: A preferred embodiment of the present invention provides for a biosensor for the rapid detection of biomolecules. Such a biosensor may be used to detect antibodies, bacteria and proteins in a variety of environments, e.g. clinical diagnostics, food analysis and environmental monitoring. Nanostructured materials which are fabricated using the thin film multilayer template of the present invention may be used as the substrate to immobilize a biorecognition layer. Electrochemical detections may be applied as the direct, label-free, and fast measurements of the analytes.","Initial efforts to develop a biosensor were focused on the detection of bacteria, such as bacteria. is a type of bacteria commonly found in the intestines of healthy humans and animals. However, O157:H7 is an emerging cause of foodborne and waterborne illness because it can produce a powerful toxin. can easily contaminate ground beef, raw milk and chicken, therefore rapid and reliable identification and control of this pathogen is extremely important, see Buchanan, R.

Under the Safe Drinking Water Act, the EPA requires public water systems to monitor for coliform bacteria, including . The effective testing of bacteria requires the analysis methods meet a number of challenging criteria. Time and sensitivity of analysis are the most important limitations. Although standard microbiological techniques allow the detection of a single bacterium, amplification of the signal is required through growth of a single cell into a colony. This process is relatively time-consuming and costly. Considerable effort is now directed towards the development of methods that can rapidly detect low concentrations of bacteria in water, food and clinical samples.","Electrochemical detection techniques are promising alternatives to some existing detection, methods, such as optical assays, see Ivnitski, D., Abdel-Hamid, I., Atanasov, P., Wilkins, E., Biosensors for detection of pathogenic bacteria, Biosensors & Bioelectronics, 1999, 14, pp. 599-624; Ghindilis, A.

Initially, the porous aluminum oxide film serves as the template. When aluminum is anodized in an appropriate acidic electrolyte under controlled conditions, it oxidizes to form a hydrated aluminum oxide (alumina) containing a two dimensional organized hexagonal array of cylindrical pores (FIGS. A and B), see also O'Sullivan, I. P., Wood, G. C., The Morphology and Mechanism of Formation of Porous Anodic Films on Aluminum, Proceedings of the Royal Society of London, Series A, Mathematical and Physical Science, 1970, 317 (1531), pp. 511-543, the entire contents and disclosure of which is hereby incorporated by reference.  shows pores  and cell walls  dispersed in alumina . The pore diameter and the interpore spacing depend primarily on the applied electrical potential and in a secondary fashion on electrolyte pH, temperature and aluminum microstructure (grain size). The anodization parameters may be precisely controlled to form pore diameters from approximately 5 to approximately 100 inn and pore depths may be several microns, but typically less than 100 microns.","The nanoporous alumina template has been first used as a synthetic host for the electrochemically deposited materials, such as gold or silver or conductive polymers. Gold has been chosen as a preferable substrate material for the application to the immunosensor. Gold may be deposited into the pores of the template by AC electrochemical seeding of the pore bottom in an electrolyte, such as 1 g\/L HAuCl.3HO with 7 g\/L HSO, and then followed by electroless growth of gold wires inside the pores using a commercial electroless plating solution, such as Neorum TWB solution (Uyemura International Corporation).","Depending on the intended application, the aluminum oxide matrix may either be left in-place or removed to produce a nanopatterned metal surface as shown in .  shows a well-ordered porous layer of AlO formed by anodization of aluminum metal. Aluminum  beneath the oxide layer is the aluminum that has not been consumed by the anodization process. The template is supported by a conductive support . Metal , such as gold or silver or conductive polymers, may be deposited in the ordered pores of AlO to form a nanostructured substrate for the immobilization of biorecognition elements. The length of the metal posts inside the pores may be controlled by controlling the time of electroless deposition. In , metal  is overplated on top of the oxide layer  during the electroless plating process. Then, both the oxide  and aluminum metal  which has not been anodized are dissolved in an acid, such as 1M HPO, or an alkaline solution, such as 1.5M NaOH. Flipping over the thin metal sheet  yields a layer of metal with metal nanowires protruding from the surface like bristles of a brush.","The thin film multilayer of the present invention has greatly simplified the manufacturing process of the nanostructured materials. Because of the elimination of the barrier layer of nanoporous alumina oxide and the conductive surface at the pore base, direct current (DC) deposition may be used to fabricate nano metal posts or dots. The thickness of the template and also the dimension of the nano material inside the template may be precisely controlled. The templated nanoscale materials growing on the conductive surface are easier to integrate with integrated circuit (IC) circuitry.",{"@attributes":{"id":"P-00142","num":"00142"},"figref":"FIGS. 30A and 30B","b":["3002","3004","3006","3008","3004"]},"Biomolecues, such as thiols (RSH) or amines (RNH) and their derivatives, have good affinity to noble metals, particularly a gold surface, see R.

In the present invention, the gold nano posts inside the porous oxide or freely standing on a conductive surface guide the binding of these molecules and form a closely packed biorecognition layer. Besides the direct binding of antibody, a DSU (dithio-bissuccinimidylundecanoate) linker has been synthesized, which will form a covalent bond with the antibody.  shows that a sulfur\u2014sulfur-bond in a DSU linker molecule will break to form Au\u2014S bond when it is close to the gold surface. The covalent immobilization of antibodies takes place when a Lysine residue of the antibody comes into contact with the DSU linker to nucleophilically attack the carbonyl carbon, thereby displacing the N-hydroxysuccinimide to form an amide linkage, as shown by FIG. . The application of linkers further improves the packing density of antibodies as well as the activity of the immobilized antibody and in-turn enhances the detection sensitivity. This improvement has been confirmed by optical density measurements by Enzyme Linked Immuno Sorbent Assay (ELISA). Metal nanowires, such as gold nanowire arrays etc., provide a greater density of active binding sites than a typical flat metal surface.","Electrochemical impedance spectroscopy (EIS) may be used for the analysis. The basic idea is that the nanostructured metal surface strongly secures a layer of sensing elements, such as antibodies, and those sensing elements sense the presence of the target molecules specifically. The local change of the composition or the structure of the interfacial layer changes the AC capacitance of the system, which may be quickly detected by an impedimetric sensor. The AC current flow in the cell crosses the interface by either a faradaic or nonfaradaic path. In the nonfaradaic path, interfaces are subjected to repetitive charging and discharging by dipole rotation, dipole induction, double-layer effects, etc., all of which do not produce chemical alternation of the interfaces, only varying amounts of interfacial charging. This interfacial charging is governed by the interfacial capacitance, which is the intrinsic property of the interfacial layer. Electrochemical Impedance Spectroscopy (EIS) is an electrochemical method wherein the electrode voltage is perturbed with an alternating signal of small amplitude (<10 mV) to observe the way in which the system follows the perturbation when the system is at a steady state or at equilibrium. The frequency of the applied voltage is varied over a large range (a few mili-Hz to 100,000 Hz). Impedance is a more general concept than resistance because it lakes the phase difference into account, and is furthermore a very sensitive and reproducible method. Because of the small amplitude of AC voltage applied, it is a nondestructive detection method for biosystems, avoiding the faradaic processes and many error-causing problems. The substrate with gold nano-posts sealed in the dielectric oxide layer is very suitable for the EIS measurement.",{"@attributes":{"id":"P-00145","num":"00145"},"figref":"FIG. 28","sup":"2 ","sub":["2","3 "],"i":"E. coli "},{"@attributes":{"id":"P-00146","num":"00146"},"figref":"FIG. 29","i":"E. coli "},"In addition to the bacteria immunosensor, the biosensing methods and apparatus of the present invention may be applied to the detection of other biomolecules, such as penicillin or other antigens or antibodies.
