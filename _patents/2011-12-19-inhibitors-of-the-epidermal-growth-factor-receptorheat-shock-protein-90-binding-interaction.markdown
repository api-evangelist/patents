{"@attributes":{"id":"description"},"RELAPP":[{},{}],"p":["This application claims the benefit of U.S. Provisional Patent Application No. 61\/425,100 filed Dec. 20, 2010. The provisional application is hereby incorporated by reference in its entirety.","This invention was made with government support under Grant No. CA131290, awarded by the National Institutes of Health. The government has certain rights in the invention.","Incorporated by reference in its entirety is a computer-readable nucleotide\/amino acid sequence listing submitted concurrently herewith and identified as follows: 71 kilobytes ACII (Text) file named \u201c45776_SeqListing.txt,\u201d created on Dec. 7, 2010.","The Epidermal Growth Factor Receptor (EGFR) is a validated therapeutic target for the treatment of many cancers. However, the inhibition of EGFR has proven effective only in a limited subset of patients.","The limitations of these cancer therapeutics may be due to the fact that the therapeutics aim to inhibit the tyrosine kinase activity of EGFR. A recent study showed that the knockdown of EGFR with small interfering RNA led to cell death in an autophagic process, independently of EGFR receptor tyrosine kinase activity. Accordingly, the inhibition of EGFR tyrosine kinase activity alone is likely insufficient to cause cytotoxicity of EGFR driven tumors.","A further drawback of some EGFR-targeted cancer therapeutics currently used in the clinical setting is that drug resistance often develops after initial use of the therapeutic. For example, while non-small cell lung cancer is initially sensitive to erlotinib, resistance develops upon subsequent administrations of this drug.","In view of the foregoing, there exists a need for a cancer therapeutic that targets EGFR in a manner other than inhibition of EGFR tyrosine kinase activity. There also exists a need for a therapeutic that treats cancer without drug resistance developing after initial use.","For the first time, it is shown herein that EGFR binds to Heat Shock Protein 90 (HSP90), and that specific disruption of this binding interaction induces EGFR degradation. Also, for the first time, it is shown herein that a particular region of EGFR is important to the binding interaction with HSP90. Based in part on these data, compounds that inhibit the binding interaction between EGFR and HSP90 have been made and have successfully demonstrated induction of selective EGFR degradation, cytotoxicity, and tumor regression.","Accordingly, the present disclosures provide compounds that inhibit a binding interaction between an EGFR and an HSP90. As further discussed herein, in some embodiments, the compound takes form of an antibody, or antibody analog, a peptide, or peptide analog.","Also provided by the present disclosures is a composition, e.g., a pharmaceutical composition, comprising a compound that inhibits a binding interaction between an EGFR and an HSP90. Kits comprising a compound that inhibits a binding interaction between an EGFR and an HSP90, optionally, in combination with a cancer therapeutic, also are provided herein.","Methods of using the compounds of the present disclosures are further provided herein. For example, a method of inhibiting a binding interaction between an EGFR and an HSP90 in a cell is provided. The method comprises contacting the cell with a compound that inhibits the binding interaction between an EGFR and an HSP90 in an amount effective to inhibit the binding interaction.","The present disclosures further provide methods of increasing degradation of an EGFR in a cell. The method comprises contacting the cell with a compound that inhibits the binding interaction between an EGFR and an HSP90 in an amount effective to increase the degradation.","The present disclosures furthermore provide methods of treating cancer in a subject. The method comprises administering to the subject a pharmaceutical composition comprising a compound that inhibits the binding interaction between an EGFR and an HSP90 in an amount effective to treat the cancer.","Further provided herein are methods of sensitizing tumors to radiation therapy, chemotherapy, or to both radiation therapy and chemotherapy, in a subject. The method comprises administering to the subject a pharmaceutical composition comprising a compound that inhibits the binding interaction between an EGFR and an HSP90 in an amount effective to sensitize the tumor to the therapy.","Inhibitors of EGFR-HSP90 Binding Interactions","Provided herein are compounds that inhibit a protein-protein binding interaction between an epidermal growth factor receptor (EGFR) and an heat shock protein 90 (HSP90). The compounds of the present disclosures may be considered as inhibitors of EGFR binding to an HSP90 and\/or inhibitors of HSP90 binding to an EGFR. In some embodiments, the compounds are competitive binding inhibitors. In certain aspects, the compounds bind to the site of EGFR to which HSP90 binds. In certain aspects, the compounds bind to the site of HSP90 to which EGFR binds. In alternative embodiments, the compounds are non-competitive binding inhibitors. In certain aspects, the compounds inhibit the binding interaction between EGFR and HSP90, yet the compounds bind to a site of EGFR other than the site to which HSP90 binds or the compounds bind to a site of HSP90 other than the site to which EGFR binds.","The inhibition provided by the compounds of the present disclosures may not be a 100% or complete inhibition or abrogation of the binding interaction between the EGFR and HSP90. Rather, there are varying degrees of inhibition of which one of ordinary skill in the art recognizes as having a potential benefit or therapeutic effect. In this respect, the compounds of the present disclosures may inhibit the binding interaction between an EGFR and an HSP90 to any amount or level. In exemplary embodiments, the compound provides at least or about a 10% inhibition (e.g., at least or about a 20% inhibition, at least or about a 30% inhibition, at least or about a 40% inhibition, at least or about a 50% inhibition, at least or about a 60% inhibition, at least or about a 70% inhibition, at least or about a 80% inhibition, at least or about a 90% inhibition, at least or about a 95% inhibition, at least or about a 98% inhibition) of the binding between EGFR and HSP90. In some embodiments, the compound completely abrogates the binding interaction between the EGFR and the HSP90, such that no EGFR-HSP90 binding complexes are detectable in a sample obtained from a subject, as measured by, for example, Western blotting, immunohistochemistry, and the like.","In some embodiments of the present disclosures, the compounds inhibit the binding interaction between a wild-type human EGFR and an HSP90. In some aspects, the compound inhibits the binding interaction between HSP90 and a wild-type human EGFR comprising an amino acid sequence of human EGFR isoform a (the amino acid sequence of which is accessible from the National Center for Biotechnology Information (NCBI) Protein Database as Accession No. NP005219). In some aspects, the compound inhibits the binding interaction between HSP90 and a wild-type human EGFR comprising an amino acid sequence of human EGFR isoform b (the amino acid sequence of which is accessible from the NCBI Protein Database as Accession No. NP958439.1). In some aspects, the compound inhibits the binding interaction between HSP90 and a wild-type human EGFR comprising an amino acid sequence of human EGFR isoform c (the amino acid sequence of which is accessible from the NCBI Protein Database as Accession No. NP958440.1). In some aspects, the compound inhibits the binding interaction between HSP90 and a wild-type human EGFR comprising an amino acid sequence of human EGFR isoform d (the amino acid sequence of which is accessible from the NCBI Protein Database as Accession No. NP958441). The amino acid sequences of each wild-type human EGFR isoform are provided herein as SEQ ID NOs: 1-4.","In other embodiments, the compounds inhibit the binding interaction between a mutant EGFR and an HSP90, wherein the mutant EGFR comprises an amino acid sequence which differs from any wild-type human EGFR amino acid sequence recognized in the art (e.g., the amino acid sequences of human EGFR isoforms a-d). In some aspects, the compound inhibits the binding interaction between HSP90 and the T790M EGFR mutant comprising the amino acid sequence of SEQ ID NO: 5 with the Thr at position 790 mutated to a Met. In other aspects, the compound inhibits the binding interaction between HSP90 and the L858R EGFR mutant comprising the amino acid sequence of SEQ ID NO: 34. In alternative aspects, the compound inhibits the binding interaction between HSP90 and the EGFRvIII mutant in which amino acids 6 to 273 are deleted and thus comprises the amino acid sequence of SEQ ID NO: 6.","In some embodiments, the compounds inhibit the binding interaction between a wild-type human HSP90 and an EGFR. In some aspects, the compound inhibits the binding interaction between an EGFR and an HSP90 comprising an amino acid sequence of SEQ ID NO: 7.","In exemplary aspects, the compound is an antibody, an antibody analog, a peptide, a peptide analog (e.g., peptoid, peptidomimetic), a nucleic acid molecule encoding any of the antibodies or peptides, or analogs thereof, or a small molecule compound (e.g., small molecule compound rationally designed based on any of the antibodies or peptides described herein).","Antibodies and Analogs Thereof.","In some embodiments of the present disclosures, the compound that inhibits a binding interaction between an EGFR and HSP90 comprises an antibody, or antigen binding fragment thereof. In some embodiments of the present disclosures, the compound that inhibits a binding interaction between an EGFR and HSP90 is provided as an antibody, or antigen binding fragment thereof. The antibody may be any type of immunoglobulin known in the art. In exemplary embodiments, the antibody is an antibody of isotype IgA, IgD, IgE, IgG, or IgM. Also, the antibody in some embodiments is a monoclonal antibody. In other embodiments, the antibody is a polyclonal antibody.","In some embodiments, the antibody is a naturally-occurring antibody, e.g., an antibody isolated and\/or purified from a mammal, e.g., mouse, rabbit, goat, horse, chicken, hamster, human, and the like. In this regard, the antibody may be considered as a mammalian antibody, e.g., a mouse antibody, rabbit antibody, goat antibody, horse antibody, chicken antibody, hamster antibody, human antibody, and the like. Methods of producing naturally-occurring antibodies are known in the art, some of which are described further herein under the section entitled \u201cMethods of Antibody Production.\u201d","In some embodiments, the antibody is a genetically-engineered antibody, e.g., a single chain antibody, a humanized antibody, a chimeric antibody, a CDR-grafted antibody, an antibody which includes portions of CDR sequences specific for EGFR or HSP90, a humaneered antibody, a bispecific antibody, a trispecific antibody, and the like. Genetic engineering techniques also provide the ability to make fully human antibodies in a non-human source.","In some aspects, the genetically-engineered antibody is a single chain antibody (SCA) specific for EGFR or HSP90. In particular aspects, the SCA binds to the site of EGFR to which HSP90 binds or the SCA binds to the site of HSP90 to which EGFR binds. In exemplary aspects, the SCA binds to an epitope as further described herein under the section entitled \u201cEpitopes.\u201d Methods of making SCAs are known in the art. See, for example, Davis et al., 9: 165-169 (1991).","In some aspects, the antibody is a chimeric antibody. The term \u201cchimeric antibody\u201d is used herein to refer to an antibody containing constant domains from one species and the variable domains from a second, or more generally, containing stretches of amino acid sequence from at least two species. In particular aspects, the chimeric antibody binds to the site of EGFR to which HSP90 binds or the chimeric antibody binds to the site of HSP90 to which EGFR binds. In exemplary aspects, the chimeric antibody binds to an epitope as further described herein under the section entitled \u201cEpitopes.\u201d","In some aspects, the antibody is a humanized antibody. The term \u201chumanized\u201d when used in relation to antibodies refers to antibodies having at least CDR regions from a non-human source which are engineered to have a structure and immunological function more similar to true human antibodies than the original source antibodies. For example, humanizing can involve grafting CDR from a non-human antibody, such as a mouse antibody, into a human antibody. Humanizing also can involve select amino acid substitutions to make a non-human sequence look more like a human sequence. In particular aspects, the humanized antibody binds to the site of EGFR to which HSP90 binds or the humanized antibody binds to the site of HSP90 to which EGFR binds. In exemplary aspects, the humanized antibody binds to an epitope as further described herein under the section entitled \u201cEpitopes.\u201d","Use of the terms \u201cchimeric or humanized\u201d herein is not meant to be mutually exclusive, and rather, is meant to encompass chimeric antibodies, humanized antibodies, and chimeric antibodies that have been further humanized. Except where context otherwise indicates, statements about (properties of, uses of, testing of, and so on) chimeric antibodies of the present disclosures apply to humanized antibodies of the present disclosures, and statements about humanized antibodies of the present disclosures pertain also to chimeric antibodies. Likewise, except where context dictates, such statements also should be understood to be applicable to antibodies and antigen binding fragments of such antibodies of the present disclosures.","In some aspects, the antibody is a CDR-grafted antibody specific for EGFR or HSP90. In particular aspects, the CDR-grafted antibody binds to the site of EGFR to which HSP90 binds or the CDR-grafted antibody binds to the site of HSP90 to which EGFR binds. In exemplary aspects, the CDR-grafted antibody binds to an epitope as further described herein under the section entitled \u201cEpitopes.\u201d Methods of making CDR-grafted antibodies are known in the art. See, for example, Lo, Benny, , Volume 248 (2004), which is incorporated by reference in its entirety.","In some aspects, the antibody is a bispecific or trispecific antibody specific for EGFR or HSP90. In particular aspects, the bispecific or trispecific antibody binds to the site of EGFR to which HSP90 binds or the bispecific or trispecific antibody binds to the site of HSP90 to which EGFR binds. In exemplary aspects, the bispecific or trispecific antibody binds to an epitope as further described herein under the section entitled \u201cEpitopes.\u201d Methods of making bispecific or trispecific antibodies are known in the art. See, for example, Marvin and Zhu, 26: 649-658 (2005) and U.S. Pat. No. 6,551,592.","In some aspects, the antibody is a Humaneered\u2122 antibody. Humaneering technology is a proprietary method of KaloBios Pharmaceuticals, Inc. (San Francisco, Calif.) for converting non human antibodies into engineered human antibodies. Humaneered\u2122 antibodies are high affinity, and highly similar to human germline antibody sequences.","In some embodiments, the antibody has a level of affinity or avidity for the EGFR which is sufficient to prevent HSP90 from binding to the EGFR. In some embodiments, the antibody has a level of affinity or avidity for the HSP90 which is sufficient to prevent EGFR from binding HSP90. Therefore in some embodiments, the affinity constant, K, (which is the inverterd dissocation constant, K) of the antibody of the present disclosures for the EGFR is greater than the Kof HSP90 for the EGFR. Alternatively, in some embodiments, the Kof the antibody of the present disclosures for the HSP90 is greater than that of EGFR for HSP90. Binding constants, including dissociation constants, may be determined by methods known in the art, including, for example, methods which utilize the principles of surface plasmon resonance, e.g., methods utilizing a Biacore\u2122 system.","In some embodiments, the antibody is in monomeric form, while in other embodiments, the antibody is conjugated to one or more antibodies (e.g., each of which recognize the same epitope of the first antibody). Accordingly, in some aspects, the antibody is in polymeric, oligomeric, or multimeric form. In certain embodiments in which the antibody comprises two or more distinct antigen binding regions fragments, the antibody is considered bispecific, trispecific, or multi-specific, or bivalent, trivalent, or multivalent, depending on the number of distinct epitopes that are recognized and bound by the antibody.","Antigen Binding Fragments","In some aspects of the present disclosures, the compound which inhibits a binding interaction between an EGFR and HSP90 is an antigen binding fragment of an antibody. The antigen binding fragment (also referred to herein as \u201cantigen binding portion\u201d) may be an antigen binding fragment of any of the antibodies described herein. The antigen binding fragment can be any part of an antibody that has at least one antigen binding site, including, but not limited to, Fab, F(ab\u2032), dsFv, sFv, diabodies, triabodies, bis-scFvs, fragments expressed by a Fab expression library, domain antibodies, VhH domains, V-NAR domains, VH domains, VL domains, and the like. Antibody fragments of the invention, however, are not limited to these exemplary types of antibody fragments.","A domain antibody comprises a functional binding unit of an antibody, and can correspond to the variable regions of either the heavy (V) or light (V) chains of antibodies. A domain antibody can have a molecular weight of approximately 13 kDa, or approximately one-tenth of a full antibody. Domain antibodies may be derived from full antibodies such as those described herein. The antigen binding fragments in some embodiments are monomeric or polymeric, bispecific or trispecific, bivalent or trivalent.","Antibody fragments that contain the antigen binding, or idiotype, of the antibody molecule may be generated by techniques known in the art. For example, such fragments include, but are not limited to, the F(ab\u2032)fragment which may be produced by pepsin digestion of the antibody molecule; the Fab\u2032 fragments which may be generated by reducing the disulfide bridges of the F(ab\u2032)fragment, and the two Fab\u2032 fragments which may be generated by treating the antibody molecule with papain and a reducing agent.","A single-chain variable region fragment (sFv) antibody fragment, which consists of a truncated Fab fragment comprising the variable (V) domain of an antibody heavy chain linked to a V domain of a light antibody chain via a synthetic peptide, can be generated using routine recombinant DNA technology techniques (see, e.g., Janeway et al., supra). Similarly, disulfide-stabilized variable region fragments (dsFv) can be prepared by recombinant DNA technology (see, e.g., Reiter et al., Protein Engineering, 7, 697-704 (1994)).","Recombinant antibody fragments, e.g., scFvs, can also be engineered to assemble into stable multimeric oligomers of high binding avidity and specificity to different target antigens. Such diabodies (dimers), triabodies (trimers) or tetrabodies (tetramers) are well known in the art, see e.g., Kortt et al., 2001 18:95-108, (2001) and Todorovska et al., 248:47-66, (2001).","Bispecific antibodies (bscAb) are molecules comprising two single-chain Fv fragments joined via a glycine-serine linker using recombinant methods. The V light-chain (V) and V heavy-chain (V) domains of two antibodies of interest in exemplary embodiments are isolated using standard PCR methods. The Vand VcDNA's obtained from each hybridoma are then joined to form a single-chain fragment in a two-step fusion PCR. Bispecific fusion proteins are prepared in a similar manner. Bispecific single-chain antibodies and bispecific fusion proteins are antibody substances included within the scope of the present invention. Exemplary bispecific antibodies are taught in U.S. Patent Application Publication No. 2005-0282233A1 and International Patent Application Publication No. WO 2005\/087812, both applications of which are incorporated herein by reference in their entirety.","Methods of Antibody or Antigen Binding Fragment Production","Suitable methods of making antibodies are known in the art. For instance, standard hybridoma methods are described in, e.g., Harlow and Lane (eds.), Antibodies: A Laboratory Manual, CSH Press (1988), and CA. Janeway et al. (eds.), Immunobiology, 5Ed., Garland Publishing, New York, N.Y. (2001)).","Briefly, a polyclonal antibody is prepared by immunizing an animal with an immunogen comprising a polypeptide of the present invention and collecting antisera from that immunized animal. A wide range of animal species can be used for the production of antisera. In some aspects, an animal used for production of anti-antisera is a non-human animal including rabbits, mice, rats, hamsters, goat, sheep, pigs or horses. Because of the relatively large blood volume of rabbits, a rabbit is a preferred choice for production of polyclonal antibodies. In an exemplary method for generating a polyclonal antisera immunoreactive with the chosen EGFR epitope, 50 \u03bcg of EGFR antigen is emulsified in Freund's Complete Adjuvant for immunization of rabbits. At intervals of, for example, 21 days, 50 \u03bcg of epitope are emulsified in Freund's Incomplete Adjuvant for boosts. Polyclonal antisera may be obtained, after allowing time for antibody generation, simply by bleeding the animal and preparing serum samples from the whole blood.","Monoclonal antibodies for use in the invention may be prepared using any technique which provides for the production of antibody molecules by continuous cell lines in culture. These include but are not limited to the hybridoma technique originally described by Koehler and Milstein (Nature 256: 495-497, 1975), the human B-cell hybridoma technique (Kosbor et al., Immunol Today 4:72, 1983; Cote et al., Proc Natl Acad Sci 80: 2026-2030, 1983) and the EBV-hybridoma technique (Cole et al., Monoclonal Antibodies and Cancer Therapy, Alan R Liss Inc, New York N.Y., pp 77-96, (1985).","Briefly, in exemplary embodiments, to generate monoclonal antibodies, a mouse is injected periodically with recombinant EGFR against which the antibody is to be raised (e.g., 10-20 \u03bcg emulsified in Freund's Complete Adjuvant). The mouse is given a final pre-fusion boost of an EGFR polypeptide in PBS, and four days later the mouse is sacrificed and its spleen removed. The spleen is placed in 10 ml serum-free RPMI 1640, and a single cell suspension is formed by grinding the spleen between the frosted ends of two glass microscope slides submerged in serum-free RPMI 1640, supplemented with 2 mM L-glutamine, 1 mM sodium pyruvate, 100 units\/ml penicillin, and 100 \u03bcg\/ml streptomycin (RPMI) (Gibco, Canada). The cell suspension is filtered through sterile 70-mesh Nitex cell strainer (Becton Dickinson, Parsippany, N.J.), and is washed twice by centrifuging at 200 g for 5 minutes and resuspending the pellet in 20 ml serum-free RPMI. Splenocytes taken from three naive Balb\/c mice are prepared in a similar manner and used as a control. NS-1 myeloma cells, kept in log phase in RPMI with 11% fetal bovine serum (FBS) (Hyclone Laboratories, Inc., Logan, Utah) for three days prior to fusion, are centrifuged at 200 g for 5 minutes, and the pellet is washed twice.","Spleen cells (1\u00d710) are combined with 2.0\u00d710NS-1 cells and centrifuged, and the supernatant is aspirated. The cell pellet is dislodged by tapping the tube, and 1 ml of 37\u00b0 C. PEG 1500 (50% in 75 mM Hepes, pH 8.0) (Boehringer Mannheim) is added with stirring over the course of 1 minute, followed by the addition of 7 ml of serum-free RPMI over 7 minutes. An additional 8 ml RPMI is added and the cells are centrifuged at 200 g for 10 minutes. After discarding the supernatant, the pellet is resuspended in 200 ml RPMI containing 15% FBS, 100 \u03bcM sodium hypoxanthine, 0.4 \u03bcM aminopterin, 16 \u03bcM thymidine (HAT) (Gibco), 25 units\/ml IL-6 (Boehringer Mannheim) and 1.5\u00d710splenocytes\/ml and plated into 10 Corning flat-bottom 96-well tissue culture plates (Corning, Corning N.Y.).","On days 2, 4, and 6, after the fusion, 100 \u03bcl of medium is removed from the wells of the fusion plates and replaced with fresh medium. On day 8, the fusion is screened by ELISA, testing for the presence of mouse IgG binding to EGFR as follows. Immulon 4 plates (Dynatech, Cambridge, Mass.) are coated for 2 hours at 37\u00b0 C. with 100 ng\/well of EGFR diluted in 25 mM Tris, pH 7.5. The coating solution is aspirated and 200 \u03bcl\/well of blocking solution (0.5% fish skin gelatin (Sigma) diluted in CMF-PBS) is added and incubated for 30 min. at 37\u00b0 C. Plates are washed three times with PBS with 0.05% Tween 20 (PBST) and 50 \u03bcl culture supernatant is added. After incubation at 37\u00b0 C. for 30 minutes, and washing as above, 50 \u03bcl of horseradish peroxidase conjugated goat anti-mouse IgG(fc) (Jackson ImmunoResearch, West Grove, Pa.) diluted 1:3500 in PBST is added. Plates are incubated as above, washed four times with PBST, and 100 \u03bcl substrate, consisting of 1 mg\/ml o-phenylene diamine (Sigma) and 0.1 \u03bcl\/ml 30% HOin 100 mM Citrate, pH 4.5, are added. The color reaction is stopped after 5 minutes with the addition of 50 \u03bcl of 15% HSO. Ais read on a plate reader (Dynatech).","Selected fusion wells are cloned twice by dilution into 96-well plates and visual scoring of the number of colonies\/well after 5 days. The monoclonal antibodies produced by hybridomas are isotyped using the Isostrip system (Boehringer Mannheim, Indianapolis, Ind.).","When the hybridoma technique is employed, myeloma cell lines may be used. Such cell lines suited for use in hybridoma-producing fusion procedures preferably are non-antibody-producing, have high fusion efficiency, and enzyme deficiencies that render them incapable of growing in certain selective media which support the growth of only the desired fused cells (hybridomas). For example, where the immunized animal is a mouse, one may use P3-X63\/Ag8, P3-X63-Ag8.653, NS1\/1.Ag 4 1, Sp210-Ag14, FO, NSO\/U, MPC-11, MPC11-X45-GTG 1.7 and S194\/15XX0 Bul; for rats, one may use R210.RCY3, Y3-Ag 1.2.3, IR983F and 4B210; and U-266, GM1500-GRG2, LICR-LON-HMy2 and UC729-6 are all useful in connection with cell fusions. It should be noted that the hybridomas and cell lines produced by such techniques for producing the monoclonal antibodies are contemplated to be novel compositions of the present disclosures.","Depending on the host species, various adjuvants may be used to increase immunological response. Such adjuvants include but are not limited to Freund's, mineral gels such as aluminum hydroxide, and surface active substances such as lysolecithin, pluronic polyols, polyanions, peptides, oil emulsions, keyhole limpet hemocyanin, and dinitrophenol. BCG (bacilli Calmette-Guerin) and are potentially useful human adjuvants.","Alternatively, other methods, such as EBV-hybridoma methods (Haskard and Archer, J. Immunol. Methods, 74(2), 361-67 (1984), and Roder et al., Methods Enzymol., 121, 140-67 (1986)), and bacteriophage vector expression systems (see, e.g., Huse et al., Science, 246, 1275-81 (1989)) are known in the art. Further, methods of producing antibodies in non-human animals are described in, e.g., U.S. Pat. Nos. 5,545,806, 5,569,825, and 5,714,352, and U.S. Patent Application Publication No. 2002\/0197266 A1).","Antibodies may also be produced by inducing in vivo production in the lymphocyte population or by screening recombinant immunoglobulin libraries or panels of highly specific binding reagents as disclosed in Orlandi et al (Proc Natl Acad Sci 86: 3833-3837; 1989), and Winter G and Milstein C (Nature 349: 293-299, 1991).","Phage display furthermore can be used to generate the antibody of the present disclosures. In this regard, phage libraries encoding antigen-binding variable (V) domains of antibodies can be generated using standard molecular biology and recombinant DNA techniques (see, e.g., Sambrook et al. (eds.), Molecular Cloning, A Laboratory Manual, 3Edition, Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory Press, New York (2001)), Phage encoding a variable region with the desired specificity are selected for specific binding to the desired antigen, and a complete or partial antibody is reconstituted comprising the selected variable domain. Nucleic acid sequences encoding the reconstituted antibody are introduced into a suitable cell line, such as a myeloma cell used for hybridoma production, such that antibodies having the characteristics of monoclonal antibodies are secreted by the cell (see, e.g., Janeway et al., supra, Huse et al., supra, and U.S. Pat. No. 6,265,150). Related methods also are described in U.S. Pat. No. 5,403,484; U.S. Pat. No. 5,571,698; U.S. Pat. No. 5,837,500; U.S. Pat. No. 5,702,892. The techniques described in U.S. Pat.

Such methods are known in the art and described in, for example U.S. Pat. Nos. 5,545,806 and 5,569,825, and Janeway et al., supra.","Methods for generating humanized antibodies are well known in the art and are described in detail in, for example, Janeway et al., supra, U.S. Pat. Nos. 5,225,539, 5,585,089 and 5,693,761, European Patent No. 0239400 B1, and United Kingdom Patent No. 2188638.

No. 4,946,778) can be adapted to produce EGFR- or HSP90-specific single chain antibodies.","A preferred chimeric or humanized antibody has a human constant region, while the variable region, or at least a CDR, of the antibody is derived from a non-human species. Methods for humanizing non-human antibodies are well known in the art. (see U.S. Pat. Nos. 5,585,089, and 5,693,762). Generally, a humanized antibody has one or more amino acid residues introduced into its framework region from a source which is non-human. Humanization can be performed, for example, using methods described in Jones et al. (321: 522-525, 1986), Riechmann et al., (332: 323-327, 1988) and Verhoeyen et al. (239:1534-1536, 1988), by substituting at least a portion of a rodent complementarity-determining region (CDRs) for the corresponding regions of a human antibody. Numerous techniques for preparing engineered antibodies are described, e.g., in Owens and Young, 168:149-165 (1994). Further changes can then be introduced into the antibody framework to modulate affinity or immunogenicity.","Likewise, using techniques known in the art to isolate CDRs, compositions comprising CDRs are generated. Complementarity determining regions are characterized by six polypeptide loops, three loops for each of the heavy or light chain variable regions. The amino acid position in a CDR is defined by Kabat et al., \u201cSequences of Proteins of Immunological Interest,\u201d U.S. Department of Health and Human Services, (1983), which is incorporated herein by reference. For example, hypervariable regions of human antibodies are roughly defined to be found at residues 28 to 35, from 49-59 and from residues 92-103 of the heavy and light chain variable regions (Janeway and Travers, 2Edition, Garland Publishing, New York, (1996)). The murine CDR also are found at approximately these amino acid residues. It is understood in the art that CDR regions may be found within several amino acids of these approximated residues set forth above. An immunoglobulin variable region also consists of four \u201cframework\u201d regions surrounding the CDRs (FR1-4). The sequences of the framework regions of different light or heavy chains are highly conserved within a species, and are also conserved between human and murine sequences.","Compositions comprising one, two, and\/or three CDRs of a heavy chain variable region or a light chain variable region of a monoclonal antibody are generated. Techniques for cloning and expressing nucleotide and polypeptide sequences are well-established in the art (see e.g. Sambrook et al., 2Edition, Cold Spring Harbor, N.Y. (1989)). The amplified CDR sequences are ligated into an appropriate plasmid. The plasmid comprising one, two, three, four, five and\/or six cloned CDRs optionally contains additional polypeptide encoding regions linked to the CDR.","Framework regions (FR) of a murine antibody are humanized by substituting compatible human framework regions chosen from a large database of human antibody variable sequences, including over twelve hundred human VH sequences and over one thousand VL sequences. The database of antibody sequences used for comparison is downloaded from Andrew C. R. Martin's KabatMan web page (rubic.rdg.ac.uk\/abs\/). The Kabat method for identifying CDR provides a means for delineating the approximate CDR and framework regions from any human antibody and comparing the sequence of a murine antibody for similarity to determine the CDRs and FRs. Best matched human VH and VL sequences are chosen on the basis of high overall framework matching, similar CDR length, and minimal mismatching of canonical and VH\/VL contact residues. Human framework regions most similar to the murine sequence are inserted between the murine CDR. Alternatively, the murine framework region may be modified by making amino acid substitutions of all or part of the native framework region that more closely resemble a framework region of a human antibody.","Additionally, another useful technique for generating antibodies for use in the present invention may be one which uses a rational design type approach. The goal of rational design is to produce structural analogs of biologically active polypeptides or compounds with which they interact (agonists, antagonists, inhibitors, peptidomimetics, binding partners, etc.). In one approach, one would generate a three-dimensional structure for the antibodies or an epitope binding fragment thereof. This could be accomplished by x-ray crystallography, computer modeling or by a combination of both approaches. An alternative approach, \u201calanine scan,\u201d involves the random replacement of residues throughout molecule with alanine, and the resulting affect on function determined.","It also is possible to solve the crystal structure of the specific antibodies. In principle, this approach yields a pharmacore upon which subsequent drug design can be based. It is possible to bypass protein crystallography altogether by generating anti-idiotypic antibodies to a functional, pharmacologically active antibody. As a mirror image of a mirror image, the binding site of anti-idiotype would be expected to be an analog of the original antigen. The anti-idiotype could then be used to identify and isolate additional antibodies from banks of chemically- or biologically-produced peptides.","Chemically constructed bispecific antibodies may be prepared by chemically cross-linking heterologous Fab or F(ab\u2032)fragments by means of chemicals such as heterobifunctional reagent succinimidyl-3-(2-pyridyldithiol)-propionate (SPDP, Pierce Chemicals, Rockford, Ill.). The Fab and F(ab\u2032)fragments can be obtained from intact antibody by digesting it with papain or pepsin, respectively (Karpovsky et al., J. Exp. Med. 160:1686-701, 1984; Titus et al., J. Immunol., 138:4018-22, 1987).","Methods of testing antibodies for the ability to bind to the epitope of the EGFR regardless of how the antibodies are produced are known in the art and include any antibody-antigen binding assay, such as, for example, radioimmunoassay (RIA), ELISA, Western blot, immunoprecipitation, and competitive inhibition assays (see, e.g., Janeway et al., infra, and U.S. Patent Application Publication No. 2002\/0197266 A1).","Aptamers","In some embodiments, the compound that inhibits a binding interaction between EGFR and HSP90 is an analog of an antibody. In some aspects, the compound is an aptamer. Recent advances in the field of combinatorial sciences have identified short polymer sequences (e.g., oligonucleic acid or peptide molecules) with high affinity and specificity to a given target. For example, SELEX technology has been used to identify DNA and RNA aptamers with binding properties that rival mammalian antibodies, the field of immunology has generated and isolated antibodies or antibody fragments which bind to a myriad of compounds and phage display has been utilized to discover new peptide sequences with very favorable binding properties. Based on the success of these molecular evolution techniques, it is certain that molecules can be created which bind to any target molecule. A loop structure is often involved with providing the desired binding attributes as in the case of: aptamers which often utilize hairpin loops created from short regions without complimentary base pairing, naturally derived antibodies that utilize combinatorial arrangement of looped hyper-variable regions and new phage display libraries utilizing cyclic peptides that have shown improved results when compared to linear peptide phage display results. Thus, sufficient evidence has been generated to suggest that high affinity ligands can be created and identified by combinatorial molecular evolution techniques. For the present disclosures, molecular evolution techniques can be used to isolate compounds specific for the EGFRs or HSP90s described herein that inhibit the binding interaction between EGFR and HSP90. For more on aptamers, see, generally, Gold, L., Singer, B., He, Y. Y., Brody. E., \u201cAptamers As Therapeutic And Diagnostic Agents,\u201d J. Biotechnol. 74:5-13 (2000). Relevant techniques for generating aptamers may be found in U.S. Pat. No. 6,699,843, which is incorporated by reference in its entirety.","Epitopes","By \u201cepitope\u201d as used herein is meant the region of or within the EGFR or HSP90 which is bound by the compound, e.g., the antibody, the antigen binding fragment, the aptamer. In some embodiments, the epitope is a linear epitope. By \u201clinear epitope\u201d as used herein refers to the region of or within the EGFR or HSP90 which is bound by the compound, which region is composed of contiguous amino acids of the amino acid sequence of the EGFR or HSP90. The amino acids of a linear epitope are located in close proximity to each other in the primary structure of the antigen and the secondary and\/or tertiary structure(s) of the antigen. For example, when the antigen, e.g., EGFR or HSP90, is in its properly folded state (e.g., its native conformation), the contiguous amino acids of the linear epitope are located in close proximity to one another.","In other aspects, the epitope of the binding construct is a conformational epitope. By \u201cconformational epitope\u201d is meant an epitope which is composed of amino acids which are located in close proximity to one another only when the EGFR or HSP90 is in its properly folded state, but are not contiguous amino acids of the amino acid sequence of the EGFR or HSP90.","In some embodiments of the present disclosures, the compound that inhibits a binding interaction between an EGFR and HSP90 binds to an epitope of an EGFR.

In this regard, the present disclosures provides recombinant expression vectors comprising any of the presently disclosed nucleic acids. For purposes herein, the term \u201crecombinant expression vector\u201d means a genetically-modified oligonucleotide or polynucleotide construct that permits the expression of an mRNA, protein, polypeptide, or peptide by a host cell, when the construct comprises a nucleotide sequence encoding the mRNA, protein, polypeptide, or peptide, and the vector is contacted with the cell under conditions sufficient to have the mRNA, protein, polypeptide, or peptide expressed within the cell.

The presently disclosed recombinant expression vectors may comprise any type of nucleotides, including, but not limited to DNA and RNA, which may be single-stranded or double-stranded, synthesized or obtained in part from natural sources, and which can contain natural, non-natural or altered nucleotides. The recombinant expression vectors may comprise naturally-occurring or non-naturally-occurring internucleotide linkages, or both types of linkages. In some aspects, the altered nucleotides or non-naturally occurring internucleotide linkages do not hinder the transcription or replication of the vector.","The recombinant expression vector of the present disclosures can be any suitable recombinant expression vector, and can be used to transform or transfect any suitable host. Suitable vectors include those designed for propagation and expansion or for expression or both, such as plasmids and viruses.

The selection of promoters, e.g., strong, weak, inducible, tissue-specific and developmental-specific, is within the ordinary skill of the artisan. Similarly, the combining of a nucleotide sequence with a promoter is also within the skill of the artisan. The promoter can be a non-viral promoter or a viral promoter, e.g., a cytomegalovirus (CMV) promoter, an SV40 promoter, an RSV promoter, and a promoter found in the long-terminal repeat of the murine stem cell virus.","The presently disclosed recombinant expression vectors may be designed for either transient expression, for stable expression, or for both.

As used herein, the term \u201cheterologous moiety\u201d is synonymous with \u201cconjugate moiety\u201d and refers to any molecule (chemical or biochemical, naturally-occurring or non-coded) which is different from the compounds of the present disclosures. Exemplary heterologous moieties include, but are not limited to, a polymer, a carbohydrate, a lipid, a nucleic acid, an oligonucleotide, a DNA or RNA, an amino acid, peptide, polypeptide, protein, therapeutic agent, (e.g., a cytotoxic agent, cytokine), or a diagnostic agent.","In some embodiments, the compounds are chemically modified with various substituents.

Chemical modifications in some aspects take a number of different forms such as heterologous peptides, polysaccarides, lipids, radioisotopes, non-standard amino acid resides and nucleic acids, metal chelates, and various cytotoxic agents.","In some embodiments, the compounds are fused to heterologous peptides to confer various properties, e.g., increased solubility and\/or stability and\/or half-life, resistance to proteolytic cleavage, modulation of clearance, targeting to particular cell or tissue types. In some embodiments, the compound is linked to a Fc domain of IgG or other immunoglobulin. In some embodiments, the compound is fused to alkaline phosphatase (AP). Methods for making Fc or AP fusion constructs are found in WO 02\/060950. By fusing the compound with protein domains that have specific properties (e.g. half life, bioavailability) it is possible to confer these properties to the compound of the present disclosures.","When the compounds are peptides, they can be modified, for instance, by glycosylation, amidation, carboxylation, or phosphorylation, or by the creation of acid addition salts, amides, esters, in particular C-terminal esters, and N-acyl derivatives, as discussed above. The peptides also can be modified to create peptide derivatives by forming covalent or noncovalent complexes with other moieties. Covalently bound complexes can be prepared by linking the chemical moieties to functional groups on the side chains of amino acids comprising the peptides, or at the N- or C-terminus.","Peptides can be conjugated to a reporter group, including, but not limited to a radiolabel, a fluorescent label, an enzyme (e.g., that catalyzes a calorimetric or fluorometric reaction), a substrate, a solid matrix, or a carrier (e.g., biotin or avidin). Examples of analogs are described in WO 98\/28621 and in Olofsson, et al, Proc. Nat'l. Acad. Sci. USA, 95:11709-11714 (1998), U.S. Pat. Nos. 5,512,545, and 5,474,982; U.S. Patent Application Nos. 20020164687 and 20020164710.","Cysteinyl residues most commonly are reacted with haloacetates (and corresponding amines), such as chloroacetic acid or chloroacetamide, to give carboxymethyl or carbocyamidomethyl derivatives. Cysteinyl residues also are derivatized by reaction with bromotrifluoroacetone, \u03b1-bromo-.beta.(5-imidozoyl)propionic acid, chloroacetyl phosphate, N-alkylmaleimides, 3-nitro-2-pyridyl disulfide, methyl 2-pyridyl disulfide, p-chloromercuribenzoate, 2-chloromercuri-4-nitrophenol, orchloro-7-nitrobenzo-2-oxa-1,3-diazole.","Histidyl residues are derivatized by reaction with diethylprocarbonate at pH 5.5-7.0 because this agent is relatively specific for the histidyl side chain. Para-bromophenacyl bromide also is useful; the reaction is preferably performed in 0.1M sodium cacodylate at pH 6.0.","Lysinyl and amino terminal residues are reacted with succinic or carboxylic acid anhydrides. Derivatization with these agents has the effect of reversing the charge of the lysinyl residues. Other suitable reagents for derivatizing \u03b1-amino-containing residues include imidoesters such as methyl picolinimidate; pyridoxal phosphate; pyridoxal; chloroborohydride; trinitrobenzenesulfonic acid; O-methylissurea; 2,4 pentanedione; and transaminase catalyzed reaction with glyoxylate.","Arginyl residues are modified by reaction with one or several conventional reagents, among them phenylglyoxal, 2,3-butanedione, 1,2-cyclohexanedione, and ninhydrin. Derivatization of arginine residues requires that the reaction be performed in alkaline conditions because of the high pK of the guanidine functional group. Furthermore, these reagents may react with the groups of lysine as well as the arginine epsilon-amino group.","The specific modification of tyrosyl residues per se has been studied extensively, with particular interest in introducing spectral labels into tyrosyl residues by reaction with aromatic diazonium compounds or tetranitromethane. Most commonly, N-acetylimidizol and tetranitromethane are used to form O-acetyl tyrosyl species and 3-nitro derivatives, respectively. Tyrosyl residues are iodinated using I or I to prepare labeled proteins for use in radioimmunoassay.","Carboxyl side groups (aspartyl or glutamyl) are selectively modified by reaction with carbodiimides (R1) such as 1-cyclohexyl-3-(2-morpholinyl-(4-ethyl) carbodiimide or 1-ethyl-3 (4 azonia 4,4-dimethylpentyl)carbodiimide. Furthermore, aspartyl and glutamyl residues are converted to asparaginyl and glutaminyl residues by reaction with ammonium ions.","Derivatization with bifunctional agents is useful for crosslinking the binding construct to water-insoluble support matrixes. Such derivation may also provide the linker that may connect adjacent binding elements in a binding construct, or a binding elements to a heterologous peptide, e.g., a Fc fragment. Commonly used crosslinking agents include, e.g., 1,1-bis(diazoacetyl)-2-phenylethane, glutaraldehyde, N-hydroxysuccinimide esters, for example, esters with 4-azidosalicylic acid, homo-bifunctional imidoesters, including disuccinimidyl esters such as 3,3\u2032-dithiiobis(succinimidylpropioonate), and bifunctional maleimides such as bis-N-maleimido-1,8-octane. Derivatizing agents such as methyl-3-[(p-azidophenyl)dithio]propioimidate yield photoactivatable intermediates that are capable of forming cross links in the presence of light. Alternatively, reactive water-insoluble matrices such as cyanogen bromide-activated carbohydrates and the reactive substrates described in U.S. Pat. Nos. 3,969,287; 3,691,016; 4,195,128; 4,247,642; 4,229,537; and 4,330,440, incorporated herein by reference, are employed for protein immobilization.","Glutaminyl and asparaginyl residues are frequently deamidated to the corresponding glutamyl and aspartyl residues. Alternatively, these residues are deamidated under mildly acidic conditions. Either form of these residues falls within the scope of this invention.","Other modifications include hydroxylation of proline and lysine, phosphorylation of hydroxyl groups of seryl or threonyl residues, methylation of the \u03b1-amino groups of lysine, arginine, and histidine side chains (T. E. Creighton, Proteins: Structure and Molecule Properties, W. H. Freeman & Co., San Francisco, pp. 79-86, 1983), acetylation of the N-terminal amine, and, in some instances, amidation of the C-terminal carboxyl groups. Such derivatives are chemically modified polypeptide compositions in which the binding construct polypeptide is linked to a polymer.","In general, chemical derivatization may be performed under any suitable condition used to react a protein with an activated polymer molecule. Methods for preparing chemical derivatives of polypeptides will generally comprise the steps of (a) reacting the polypeptide with the activated polymer molecule (such as a reactive ester or aldehyde derivative of the polymer molecule) under conditions whereby the binding construct becomes attached to one or more polymer molecules, and (b) obtaining the reaction product(s). The optimal reaction conditions will be determined based on known parameters and the desired result. For example, the larger the ratio of polymer molecules:protein, the greater the amount of attached polymer molecule. In some embodiments, the compound may have a single polymer molecule moiety at the amino terminus. (See, e.g., U.S. Pat. No. 5,234,784).","Derivatized binding constructs disclosed herein may have additional activities, enhanced or reduced biological activity, or other characteristics, such as increased or decreased half-life, as compared to the non-derivatized molecules.","In some embodiments, the compound is directly joined to a conjugate moiety in the absence of a linker. In alternative aspects, the compound is indirectly connected to the conjugate moiety via one or more linkers. Whether directly joined together or indirectly joined together through a linker, the compound may be connected through covalent bonds (e.g., a peptide, ester, amide, or sulfhydryl bond) or non-covalent bonds (e.g., via hydrophobic interaction, hydrogen bond, van der Waals bond, electrostatic or ionic interaction), or a combination thereof. The compound of the present disclosures and conjugate moiety may be connected via any means known in the art, including, but not limited to, via a linker of any of the present disclosures. See, for example, the section herein entitled \u201cLinkers.\u201d","Conjugates: Fc Fusions","For substituents such as an Fc region of human IgG, the fusion can be fused directly to a compound of the present disclosures or fused through an intervening sequence. For example, a human IgG hinge, CH2 and CH3 region may be fused at either the N-terminus or C-terminus of a binding construct to attach the Fc region. The resulting Fc-fusion construct enables purification via a Protein A affinity column (Pierce, Rockford, Ill.). Peptide and proteins fused to an Fc region can exhibit a substantially greater half-life in vivo than the unfused counterpart. A fusion to an Fc region allows for dimerization\/multimerization of the fusion polypeptide. The Fc region may be a naturally occurring Fc region, or may be modified for superior characteristics, e.g., therapeutic qualities, circulation time, reduced aggregation. As noted above, in some embodiments, the compounds are conjugated, e.g., fused to an immunoglobulin or portion thereof (e.g., variable region, CDR, or Fc region). Known types of immunoglobulins (Ig) include IgG, IgA, IgE, IgD or IgM. The Fc region is a C-terminal region of an Ig heavy chain, which is responsible for binding to Fc receptors that carry out activities such as recycling (which results in prolonged half-life), antibody dependent cell-mediated cytotoxicity (ADCC), and complement dependent cytotoxicity (CDC).","For example, according to some definitions the human IgG heavy chain Fc region stretches from Cys226 to the C-terminus of the heavy chain. The \u201chinge region\u201d generally extends from Glu216 to Pro230 of human IgG1 (hinge regions of other IgG isotypes may be aligned with the IgG1 sequence by aligning the cysteines involved in cysteine bonding). The Fc region of an IgG includes two constant domains, CH2 and CH3. The CH2 domain of a human IgG Fc region usually extends from amino acids 231 to amino acid 341. The CH3 domain of a human IgG Fc region usually extends from amino acids 342 to 447. References made to amino acid numbering of immunoglobulins or immunoglobulin fragments, or regions, are all based on Kabat et al. 1991, Sequences of Proteins of Immunological Interest, U.S. Department of Public Health, Bethesda, Md. In a related embodiments, the Fc region may comprise one or more native or modified constant regions from an immunoglobulin heavy chain, other than CH1, for example, the CH2 and CH3 regions of IgG and IgA, or the CH3 and CH4 regions of IgE.","Suitable conjugate moieties include portions of immunoglobulin sequence that include the FcRn binding site. FcRn, a salvage receptor, is responsible for recycling immunoglobulins and returning them to circulation in blood. The region of the Fc portion of IgG that binds to the FcRn receptor has been described based on X-ray crystallography (Burmeister et al. 1994, Nature 372:379). The major contact area of the Fc with the FcRn is near the junction of the CH2 and CH3 domains. Fc-FcRn contacts are all within a single Ig heavy chain. The major contact sites include amino acid residues 248, 250-257, 272, 285, 288, 290-291, 308-311, and 314 of the CH2 domain and amino acid residues 385-387, 428, and 433-436 of the CH3 domain.","Some conjugate moieties may or may not include Fc\u03b3R binding site(s). Fc\u03b3R are responsible for ADCC and CDC. Examples of positions within the Fc region that make a direct contact with Fc\u03b3R are amino acids 234-239 (lower hinge region), amino acids 265-269 (B\/C loop), amino acids 297-299 (C\u2032\/E loop), and amino acids 327-332 (F\/G) loop (Sondermann et al., Nature 406: 267-273, 2000). The lower hinge region of IgE has also been implicated in the FcRI binding (Henry, et al., Biochemistry 36, 15568-15578, 1997). Residues involved in IgA receptor binding are described in Lewis et al., (J. Immunol. 175:6694-701, 2005). Amino acid residues involved in IgE receptor binding are described in Sayers et al. (J Biol. Chem. 279(34):35320-5, 2004).","Amino acid modifications may be made to the Fc region of an immunoglobulin. Such variant Fc regions comprise at least one amino acid modification in the CH3 domain of the Fc region (residues 342-447) and\/or at least one amino acid modification in the CH2 domain of the Fc region (residues 231-341). Mutations believed to impart an increased affinity for FcRn include T256A, T307A, E380A, and N434A (Shields et al. 2001, J. Biol. Chem. 276:6591). Other mutations may reduce binding of the Fc region to Fc\u03b3RI, Fc\u03b3RIIA, Fc\u03b3RIIB, and\/or Fc\u03b3RIIIA without significantly reducing affinity for FcRn. For example, substitution of the Asn at position 297 of the Fc region with Ala or another amino acid removes a highly conserved N-glycosylation site and may result in reduced immunogenicity with concomitant prolonged half-life of the Fc region, as well as reduced binding to Fc\u03b3R5 (Routledge et al. 1995, Transplantation 60:847; Friend et al. 1999, Transplantation 68:1632; Shields et al. 1995, J. Biol. Chem. 276:6591). Amino acid modifications at positions 233-236 of IgG1 have been made that reduce binding to Fc\u03b3R5 (Ward and Ghetie 1995, Therapeutic Immunology 2:77 and Armour et al. 1999, Eur. J. Immunol. 29:2613). Some exemplary amino acid substitutions are described in U.S. Pat. Nos. 7,355,008 and 7,381,408, each incorporated by reference herein in its entirety.","Heterologous Moieties: Polymers, Carbohydrates, and Lipids","In some embodiments, the heterologous moiety is a polymer. The polymer may be branched or unbranched. The polymer may be of any molecular weight. The polymer in some embodiments has an average molecular weight of between about 2 kDa to about 100 kDa (the term \u201cabout\u201d indicating that in preparations of a water soluble polymer, some molecules will weigh more, some less, than the stated molecular weight). The average molecular weight of the polymer is in some aspect between about 5 kDa and about 50 kDa, between about 12 kDa to about 40 kDa or between about 20 kDa to about 35 kDa.","In some embodiments, the polymer is modified to have a single reactive group, such as an active ester for acylation or an aldehyde for alkylation, so that the degree of polymerization may be controlled. The polymer in some embodiments is water soluble so that the protein to which it is attached does not precipitate in an aqueous environment, such as a physiological environment. In some embodiments, when, for example, the composition is used for therapeutic use, the polymer is pharmaceutically acceptable. Additionally, in some aspects, the polymer is a mixture of polymers, e.g., a co-polymer, a block co-polymer.","In some embodiments, the polymer is selected from the group consisting of: polyamides, polycarbonates, polyalkylenes and derivatives thereof including, polyalkylene glycols, polyalkylene oxides, polyalkylene terepthalates, polymers of acrylic and methacrylic esters, including poly(methyl methacrylate), poly(ethyl methacrylate), poly(butylmethacrylate), poly(isobutyl methacrylate), poly(hexylmethacrylate), poly(isodecyl methacrylate), poly(lauryl methacrylate), poly(phenyl methacrylate), poly(methyl acrylate), poly(isopropyl acrylate), poly(isobutyl acrylate), and poly(octadecyl acrylate), polyvinyl polymers including polyvinyl alcohols, polyvinyl ethers, polyvinyl esters, polyvinyl halides, poly(vinyl acetate), and polyvinylpyrrolidone, polyglycolides, polysiloxanes, polyurethanes and co-polymers thereof, celluloses including alkyl cellulose, hydroxyalkyl celluloses, cellulose ethers, cellulose esters, nitro celluloses, methyl cellulose, ethyl cellulose, hydroxypropyl cellulose, hydroxypropyl methyl cellulose, hydroxybutyl methyl cellulose, cellulose acetate, cellulose propionate, cellulose acetate butyrate, cellulose acetate phthalate, carboxylethyl cellulose, cellulose triacetate, and cellulose sulphate sodium salt, polypropylene, polyethylenes including poly(ethylene glycol), poly(ethylene oxide), and poly(ethylene terephthalate), and polystyrene.","In some aspects, the polymer is a biodegradable polymer, including a synthetic biodegradable polymer (e.g., polymers of lactic acid and glycolic acid, polyanhydrides, poly(ortho)esters, polyurethanes, poly(butic acid), poly(valeric acid), and poly(lactide-cocaprolactone)), and a natural biodegradable polymer (e.g., alginate and other polysaccharides including dextran and cellulose, collagen, chemical derivatives thereof (substitutions, additions of chemical groups, for example, alkyl, alkylene, hydroxylations, oxidations, and other modifications routinely made by those skilled in the art), albumin and other hydrophilic proteins (e.g., zein and other prolamines and hydrophobic proteins)), as well as any copolymer or mixture thereof. In general, these materials degrade either by enzymatic hydrolysis or exposure to water in vivo, by surface or bulk erosion.","In some aspects, the polymer is a bioadhesive polymer, such as a bioerodible hydrogel described by H. S. Sawhney, C. P. Pathak and J. A. Hubbell in Macromolecules, 1993, 26, 581-587, the teachings of which are incorporated herein, polyhyaluronic acids, casein, gelatin, glutin, polyanhydrides, polyacrylic acid, alginate, chitosan, poly(methyl methacrylates), poly(ethyl methacrylates), poly(butylmethacrylate), poly(isobutyl methacrylate), poly(hexylmethacrylate), poly(isodecyl methacrylate), poly(lauryl methacrylate), poly(phenyl methacrylate), poly(methyl acrylate), poly(isopropyl acrylate), poly(isobutyl acrylate), and poly(octadecyl acrylate).","In some embodiments, the polymer is a water-soluble polymer or a hydrophilic polymer. Suitable water-soluble polymers are known in the art and include, for example, polyvinylpyrrolidone, hydroxypropyl cellulose (HPC; Klucel), hydroxypropyl methylcellulose (HPMC; Methocel), nitrocellulose, hydroxypropyl ethylcellulose, hydroxypropyl butylcellulose, hydroxypropyl pentylcellulose, methyl cellulose, ethylcellulose (Ethocel), hydroxyethyl cellulose, various alkyl celluloses and hydroxyalkyl celluloses, various cellulose ethers, cellulose acetate, carboxymethyl cellulose, sodium carboxymethyl cellulose, calcium carboxymethyl cellulose, vinyl acetate\/crotonic acid copolymers, poly-hydroxyalkyl methacrylate, hydroxymethyl methacrylate, methacrylic acid copolymers, polymethacrylic acid, polymethylmethacrylate, maleic anhydride\/methyl vinyl ether copolymers, poly vinyl alcohol, sodium and calcium polyacrylic acid, polyacrylic acid, acidic carboxy polymers, carboxypolymethylene, carboxyvinyl polymers, polyoxyethylene polyoxypropylene copolymer, polymethylvinylether co-maleic anhydride, carboxymethylamide, potassium methacrylate divinylbenzene co-polymer, polyoxyethyleneglycols, polyethylene oxide, and derivatives, salts, and combinations thereof. In some aspects, the water soluble polymers or mixtures thereof include, but are not limited to, N-linked or O-linked carbohydrates, sugars, phosphates, carbohydrates; sugars; phosphates; polyethylene glycol (PEG) (including the forms of PEG that have been used to derivatize proteins, including mono-(C1-C10) alkoxy- or aryloxy-polyethylene glycol); monomethoxy-polyethylene glycol; dextran (such as low molecular weight dextran, of, for example about 6 kD), cellulose; cellulose; other carbohydrate-based polymers, poly-(N-vinyl pyrrolidone)polyethylene glycol, propylene glycol homopolymers, a polypropylene oxide\/ethylene oxide co-polymer, polyoxyethylated polyols (e.g., glycerol) and polyvinyl alcohol. Also encompassed by the present invention are bifunctional crosslinking molecules which may be used to prepare covalently attached multimers.","A particularly preferred water-soluble polymer for use herein is polyethylene glycol (PEG). As used herein, polyethylene glycol is meant to encompass any of the forms of PEG that can be used to derivatize other proteins, such as mono-(C1-C10) alkoxy- or aryloxy-polyethylene glycol. PEG is a linear or branched neutral polyether, available in a broad range of molecular weights, and is soluble in water and most organic solvents. PEG is effective at excluding other polymers or peptides when present in water, primarily through its high dynamic chain mobility and hydrophibic nature, thus creating a water shell or hydration sphere when attached to other proteins or polymer surfaces. PEG is nontoxic, non-immunogenic, and approved by the Food and Drug Administration for internal consumption.","Proteins or enzymes when conjugated to PEG have demonstrated bioactivity, non-antigenic properties, and decreased clearance rates when administered in animals. F. M. Veronese et al., Preparation and Properties of Monomethoxypoly(ethylene glycol)-modified Enzymes for Therapeutic Applications, in J. M. Harris ed., Poly(Ethylene Glycol) Chemistry\u2014Biotechnical and Biomedical Applications, 127-36, 1992, incorporated herein by reference. These phenomena are due to the exclusion properties of PEG in preventing recognition by the immune system. In addition, PEG has been widely used in surface modification procedures to decrease protein adsorption and improve blood compatibility. S. W. Kim et al., Ann. N.Y. Acad. Sci. 516: 116-30 1987; Jacobs et al., Artif. Organs 12: 500-501, 1988; Park et al., J. Poly. Sci, Part A 29:1725-31, 1991, incorporated herein by reference. Hydrophobic polymer surfaces, such as polyurethanes and polystyrene can be modified by the grafting of PEG (MW 3,400) and employed as nonthrombogenic surfaces. Surface properties (contact angle) can be more consistent with hydrophilic surfaces, due to the hydrating effect of PEG. More importantly, protein (albumin and other plasma proteins) adsorption can be greatly reduced, resulting from the high chain motility, hydration sphere, and protein exclusion properties of PEG.","PEG (MW 3,400) was determined as an optimal size in surface immobilization studies, Park et al., J. Biomed. Mat. Res. 26:739-45, 1992, while PEG (MW 5,000) was most beneficial in decreasing protein antigenicity. (F. M. Veronese et al., In J. M. Harris, et al., Poly(Ethylene Glycol) Chemistry\u2014Biotechnical and Biomedical Applications, 127-36.)","Methods for preparing pegylated compounds may comprise the steps of (a) reacting the compound with polyethylene glycol (such as a reactive ester or aldehyde derivative of PEG) under conditions whereby the compound becomes attached to one or more PEG groups, and (b) obtaining the reaction product(s). In general, the optimal reaction conditions for the acylation reactions will be determined based on known parameters and the desired result. For example, the larger the ratio of PEG: compound, the greater the percentage of poly-pegylated product. In some embodiments, the compound will have a single PEG moiety at the N-terminus. See U.S. Pat. No. 8,234,784, herein incorporated by reference.","In some embodiments, the heterologous moiety is a carbohydrate. In some embodiments, the carbohydrate is a monosaccharide (e.g., glucose, galactose, fructose), a disaccharide (e.g., sucrose, lactose, maltose), an oligosaccharide (e.g., raffinose, stachyose), a polysaccharide (a starch, amylase, amylopectin, cellulose, chitin, callose, laminarin, xylan, mannan, fucoidan, galactomannan.","In some embodiments, the heterologous moiety is a lipid. The lipid, in some embodiments, is a fatty acid, eicosanoid, prostaglandin, leukotriene, thromboxane, N-acyl ethanolamine), glycerolipid (e.g., mono-, di-, tri-substituted glycerols), glycerophospholipid (e.g., phosphatidylcholine, phosphatidylinositol, phosphatidylethanolamine, phosphatidylserine), sphingolipid (e.g., sphingosine, ceramide), sterol lipid (e.g., steroid, cholesterol), prenol lipid, saccharolipid, or a polyketide, oil, wax, cholesterol, sterol, fat-soluble vitamin, monoglyceride, diglyceride, triglyceride, a phospholipid.","Heterologous Moieties: Therapeutic Agents","In some embodiments, the heterologous moiety is a therapeutic agent.

The cytotoxic agent is any molecule (chemical or biochemical) which is toxic to a cell. In some aspects, when a cytotoxic agent is conjugated to a compound of the present disclosures, the results obtained are synergistic. That is to say, the effectiveness of the combination therapy of a compound and the cytotoxic agent is synergistic, i.e., the effectiveness is greater than the effectiveness expected from the additive individual effects of each. Therefore, the dosage of the cytotoxic agent can be reduced and thus, the risk of the toxicity problems and other side effects is concomitantly reduced. In some embodiments, the cytotoxic agent is a chemotherapeutic agent. Chemotherapeutic agents are known in the art and include, but not limited to, platinum coordination compounds, topoisomerase inhibitors, antibiotics, antimitotic alkaloids and difluoronucleosides, as described in U.S. Pat. No. 6,630,124.","In some embodiments, the chemotherapeutic agent is a platinum coordination compound. The term \u201cplatinum coordination compound\u201d refers to any tumor cell growth inhibiting platinum coordination compound that provides the platinum in the form of an ion. In some embodiments, the platinum coordination compound is cis-diamminediaquoplatinum (II)-ion; chloro(diethylenetriamine)-platinum(II)chloride; dichloro(ethylenediamine)-platinum(II), diammine(1,1-cyclobutanedicarboxylato) platinum(II) (carboplatin); spiroplatin; iproplatin; diammine(2-ethylmalonato)-platinum(II); ethylenediaminemalonatoplatinum(II); aqua(1,2-diaminodyclohexane)-sulfatoplatinum(II); (1,2-diaminocyclohexane)malonatoplatinum(II); (4-caroxyphthalato)(1,2-diaminocyclohexane)platinum(II); (1,2-diaminocyclohexane)-(isocitrato)platinum(II); (1,2-diaminocyclohexane)cis(pyruvato)platinum(II); (1,2-diaminocyclohexane)oxalatoplatinum(II); ormaplatin; and tetraplatin.","In some embodiments, cisplatin is the platinum coordination compound employed in the compositions and methods of the present invention. Cisplatin is commercially available under the name PLATINOL\u2122 from Bristol Myers-Squibb Corporation and is available as a powder for constitution with water, sterile saline or other suitable vehicle. Other platinum coordination compounds suitable for use in the present invention are known and are available commercially and\/or can be prepared by conventional techniques. Cisplatin, or cis-dichlorodiaminoplatinum II, has been used successfully for many years as a chemotherapeutic agent in the treatment of various human solid malignant tumors. More recently, other diamino-platinum complexes have also shown efficacy as chemotherapeutic agents in the treatment of various human solid malignant tumors. Such diamino-platinum complexes include, but are not limited to, spiroplatinum and carboplatinum. Although cisplatin and other diamino-platinum complexes have been widely used as chemotherapeutic agents in humans, they have had to be delivered at high dosage levels that can lead to toxicity problems such as kidney damage.","In some embodiments, the chemotherapeutic agent is a topoisomerase inhibitor. Topoisomerases are enzymes that are capable of altering DNA topology in eukaryotic cells. They are critical for cellular functions and cell proliferation. Generally, there are two classes of topoisomerases in eukaryotic cells, type I and type II. Topoisomerase I is a monomeric enzyme of approximately 100,000 molecular weight. The enzyme binds to DNA and introduces a transient single-strand break, unwinds the double helix (or allows it to unwind), and subsequently reseals the break before dissociating from the DNA strand. Various topoisomerase inhibitors have recently shown clinical efficacy in the treatment of humans afflicted with ovarian, cancer, esophageal cancer or non-small cell lung carcinoma.","In some aspects, the topoisomerase inhibitor is camptothecin or a camptothecin analog. Camptothecin is a water-insoluble, cytotoxic alkaloid produced by Camptotheca accuminata trees indigenous to China and Nothapodytes foetida trees indigenous to India. Camptothecin exhibits tumor cell growth inhibiting activity against a number of tumor cells. Compounds of the camptothecin analog class are typically specific inhibitors of DNA topoisomerase I. By the term \u201cinhibitor of topoisomerase\u201d is meant any tumor cell growth inhibiting compound that is structurally related to camptothecin. Compounds of the camptothecin analog class include, but are not limited to; topotecan, irinotecan and 9-aminocamptothecin.","In additional embodiments, the cytotoxic agent is any tumor cell growth inhibiting camptothecin analog claimed or described in: U.S. Pat.

For instance, the compound of the present disclosure can be conjugated either directly or indirectly through a linker to a targeting moiety. The practice of conjugating compounds to targeting moieties is known in the art. See, for instance, Wadhwa et al., 3, 111-127 (1995) and U.S. Pat. No. 5,087,616. The term \u201ctargeting moiety\u201d as used herein, refers to any molecule or agent that specifically recognizes and binds to a cell-surface receptor, such that the targeting moiety directs the delivery of the compound of the present disclosures to a population of cells on which surface the receptor is expressed. Targeting moieties include, but are not limited to, antibodies, or fragments thereof, peptides, hormones, growth factors, cytokines, and any other natural or non-natural ligands, which bind to cell surface receptors (e.g., Epithelial Growth Factor Receptor (EGFR), T-cell receptor (TCR), B-cell receptor (BCR), CD28, Platelet-derived Growth Factor Receptor (PDGF), nicotinic acetylcholine receptor (nAChR), etc.). As used herein a \u201clinker\u201d is a bond, molecule or group of molecules that binds two separate entities to one another. Linkers may provide for optimal spacing of the two entities or may further supply a labile linkage that allows the two entities to be separated from each other. Labile linkages include photocleavable groups, acid-labile moieties, base-labile moieties and enzyme-cleavable groups. The term \u201clinker\u201d in some embodiments refers to any agent or molecule that bridges the compound of the present disclosures to the targeting moiety. The linker may be any of those described herein under the section entitled \u201cLinkers.\u201d One of ordinary skill in the art recognizes that sites on the compound of the present disclosures, which are not necessary for the function of the compound, are ideal sites for attaching a linker and\/or a targeting moiety, provided that the linker and\/or targeting moiety, once attached to the compound, do(es) not interfere with the function of the compound, i.e., the ability to inhibit the binding interaction between EGFR and HSP90, as described herein.","Linkers","In some embodiments, the conjugate comprises a linker that joins the compound of the present disclosures to the heterologous moiety.

Chain atoms and linkers may be selected according to their expected solubility (hydrophilicity) so as to provide a more soluble conjugate. In some embodiments, the linker provides a functional group that is subject to cleavage by an enzyme or other catalyst or hydrolytic conditions found in the target tissue or organ or cell. In some embodiments, the length of the linker is long enough to reduce the potential for steric hindrance. In some embodiments, the linker is an amino acid or a peptidyl linker. Such peptidyl linkers may be any length. Exemplary linkers are from about 1 to 50 amino acids in length, 5 to 50, 3 to 5, 5 to 10, 5 to 15, or 10 to 30 amino acids in length.","Dimers & Multimers","In some embodiments, the compound is provided as a dimer or a multimer in which more than one compound of the present disclosures are linked together.

Formulations suitable for vaginal administration can be presented as pessaries, tampons, creams, gels, pastes, foams, or spray formulas containing, in addition to the active ingredient, such carriers as are known in the art to be appropriate.","It will be appreciated by one of skill in the art that, in addition to the above-described pharmaceutical compositions, the active agent of the disclosure can be formulated as inclusion complexes, such as cyclodextrin inclusion complexes, or liposomes.","Dosages","The active agents of the disclosure are believed to be useful in methods of inhibiting a binding interaction between EGFR and HSP90, methods of increasing EGFR degradation, methods of treating cancer in a subject, and methods of sensitizing tumors to treatment, as further described herein. For purposes of the disclosure, the amount or dose of the active agent administered should be sufficient to effect, e.g., a therapeutic or prophylactic response, in the subject or animal over a reasonable time frame. For example, the dose of the active agent of the present disclosure should be sufficient to treat cancer as described herein in a period of from about 1 to 4 minutes, 1 to 4 hours or 1 to 4 weeks or longer, e.g., 5 to 20 or more weeks, from the time of administration. In certain embodiments, the time period could be even longer. The dose will be determined by the efficacy of the particular active agent and the condition of the animal (e.g., human), as well as the body weight of the animal (e.g., human) to be treated.","Many assays for determining an administered dose are known in the art. For purposes herein, an assay, which comprises comparing the extent to which cancer is treated upon administration of a given dose of the active agent of the present disclosure to a mammal among a set of mammals, each set of which is given a different dose of the active agent, could be used to determine a starting dose to be administered to a mammal. The extent to which cancer is treated upon administration of a certain dose can be represented by, for example, the cytotoxicity of the active agent or the extent of tumor regression achieved with the active agent in a mouse xenograft model. Methods of measuring cytotoxicity of compounds and methods of assaying tumor regression are known in the art, including, for instance, the methods described in the EXAMPLES set forth below.","The dose of the active agent of the present disclosure also will be determined by the existence, nature and extent of any adverse side effects that might accompany the administration of a particular active agent of the present disclosure.

Depot forms of active agents of the present disclosures can be, for example, an implantable composition comprising the active agents and a porous or non-porous material, such as a polymer, wherein the active agent is encapsulated by or diffused throughout the material and\/or degradation of the non-porous material. The depot is then implanted into the desired location within the body of the subject and the active agent is released from the implant at a predetermined rate.","The pharmaceutical composition comprising the active agent in certain aspects is modified to have any type of in vivo release profile. In some aspects, the pharmaceutical composition is an immediate release, controlled release, sustained release, extended release, delayed release, or bi-phasic release formulation.

EGFR (sc-03) antibody was acquired from Santa Cruz Biotechnology. Antibodies for glyceraldehyde-3-phosphate dehydrogenase (GAPDH), HSP70, cleaved PARP, and LC3B were purchased from Cell Signaling Technology, whereas, antibodies to detect ErbB2 and HSP90 were purchased from Neomarkers and Pharmingen, respectively. Cycloheximide and MG132 were obtained from Sigma. Peptides were synthesized by Peptide 2.0 and American Peptide Company. Peptide transfection reagent chariot was purchased from Active Motif.","Cell Culture","All the cells were purchased from the American Type Culture Collection unless otherwise mentioned. The human head and neck squamous cell carcinoma cell lines UMSCC1, 10B, 11B, 12, 17B, 29, 33 and 74B were kindly provided by T. Carey (University of Michigan, Ann Arbor, Mich.). The lung cancer cell line H1975 was provided by J. Engelman (Massachusetts General Hospital, MA). All cell lines were grown in RPMI 1640 supplemented with 10% cosmic calf serum. For all in vitro experiments, cells were released from flasks using PBS containing 0.01% trypsin and 0.20 mmol\/L EDTA, and 6\u00d710cells were plated onto 100-mm culture dishes two days before any treatment.","Immunoblotting","Cells were scraped into PBS containing a sodium orthovanadate and protease inhibitor mixture (Roche Diagnostic Co). Cells were incubated for 15 min on ice in Laemmli buffer (63 mM Tris-HCl, 2% (w\/v) SDS, 10% (v\/v) glycerol, and 0.005% (w\/v) bromophenol blue) containing 100 mM NaF, 1 mM NaVo, 1 mM phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride, and 1 \u03bcg\/ml aprotinin. After sonication, particulate material was removed by centrifugation at 13,000 rpm for 15 min at 4\u00b0 C. The soluble protein fraction was heated to 95\u00b0 C. for 5 min, then applied to a 4-12% bis-tris precast gel (Invitrogen) and transferred onto a PVDF membrane. Membranes were incubated for 1 h at room temperature in blocking buffer consisting of 3% BSA and 1% normal goat serum in Tris-buffered saline [137 mM NaCl, 20 mM Tris-HCl (pH 7.6), 0.1% (v\/v) Tween 20]. Membranes were subsequently incubated overnight at 4\u00b0 C. with 1 \u03bcg\/ml primary antibody in blocking buffer, washed, and incubated for 1 h with horseradish peroxidase-conjugated secondary antibody (Cell Signaling, Danvers, Mass.). After three additional washes in Tris-buffered saline, bound antibody was detected by enhanced chemiluminescence plus reagent (Amersham Biosciences, Piscataway, N.J.). For quantification of relative protein levels, immunoblot films were scanned and analyzed using ImageJ 1.32j software (NIH, Bethesda, Md.). Unless otherwise indicated, the relative protein levels shown represent a comparison to untreated controls.","Immunoprecipitation","Cells were trypsinized, washed twice with 1\u00d7PBS, and cell lysates were prepared by incubation for 30 min on ice in fresh lysis buffer [1% Triton X-100, 0.1% sodium dodacyl sulfate, 0.15M sodium chloride, 0.01M sodium phosphate, pH 7.2 1 mmol\/L phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride, 2 \u03bcg\/mL aprotinin, 0.2 mmol\/L sodium orthovanadate, 50 mM sodium fluoride, 2 mM EDTA] containing 20 mM ammonium molybdate. Immunoprecipitation of EGFR and HSP90 was performed as described previously.","Site Directed Mutagenesis of EGFR Constructs and Transfections","A modified site directed mutagenesis protocol was used to create the desired mutations in EGFR. The protocol includes 5\u2032 end phosphorylation of the primer using T4 polynucleotide kinase enzyme followed by polymerase chain reaction (PCR) with single primer and DpnI enzyme treatment. Primers for site directed mutagenesis were designed by introducing minimal nucleotide changes in the DNA sequence of EGFR cloned into the N1-EYFP vector (Clontech). Mutations in EGFR were confirmed by the University of Michigan DNA sequencing core facility. UMSCC11B and CHO cells were transiently transfected with the constructs using Lipofectamine (Invitrogen) according to the instructions of the manufacturer.","Clonogenic Cell Survival Assay","Clonogenic assays were performed using standard techniques.The fraction surviving each treatment was normalized to the survival of the control cells. Peptide cell survival curves were fitted using the equation SF=(C)\/[(C)+C], where SF is the surviving fraction, C is the peptide concentration, Cis the concentration of peptide that produces a 50% cell survival and m is the slope of the sigmoid curve.","Immunostaining","After slides were deparaffinized in xylene and rehydrated using serial ethanol dilutions, antigen site unmasking was performed by immersing slides in 100 nmol\/L citrate buffer for 20 minutes at high pressure and temperature inside a pressure cooker. Slides were then washed in PBS, blocked for 1 hour, and incubated in primary antibody at 4\u00b0 C. overnight. Slides were then washed again in PBS, incubated in secondary antibody for 1 hour, rewashed, and prepared with a coverslip after a drop of ProLong Gold antifade reagent with 4\u2032,6-diamidino-2-phenylindole (Molecular Probes) was added to each sample. Fluorescence images were acquired using a DP70 camera fitted on an Olympus 1X-71 microscope.","Half Life Studies of WT-EGFR and 768-773 EGFR Constructs","CHO cells were transfected with an equal amount of DNA template (1 \u03bcg) of WT and 768-773 EGFR constructs. 24 hours post transfection, CHX (50 \u03bcg\/ml) was added to cells expressing each of these constructs. Cells were harvested at 0, 2 and 6 hours post treatment, and immunoblotting was carried out for EGFR and GAPDH to analyze the relative decrease in EGFR protein levels in the 768-773 construct compared with WT.","GST EGFR-HSP90 Direct Interaction Assay","GST pull-down experiments to detect a physical interaction between EGFR and HSP90 were performed using standard procedures. Briefly, purified GST-EGFR(His672-Ala1210, 90 kDa, 1 \u03bcg) fusion protein (Cat #7706, Cell Signaling) was incubated with 50 \u03bcl (3.5 mg swelled in deionized water) of glutathione-agarose beads (Cat #G4510, Sigma) equilibrated in 0.5\u00d7 Superdex buffer (1\u00d7 Superdex buffer: 25 mM HEPES, pH 7.5, 12.5 mM MgCl, 10 \u03bcM ZnSO, 150 mM KCl, 20% glycerol, 0.1% Nonidet P-40, and 1 mM EDTA) for 2 hours at 4\u00b0 C. and then washed three times with 0.5\u00d7 Superdex buffer. About 200 ng purified HSP90 protein (Cat # SPP-770, Assay Designs) was then added to the washed beads and incubated overnight at 4\u00b0 C. The beads were washed three times using 0.5 Superdex buffer, boiled in Laemmli buffer, and the bound HSP90-EGFR complex was immunodetected following immunoblotting with HSP90 and EGFR specific antibodies.","Peptide Internalization Assay","The UMSCC1 xenografts were cryopreserved in OCT (Electron Microscopy Sciences). Five \u03bcm sections were cut from tissues prepared on days 1 and 3 after peptide treatment. Sections were fixed in cold methanol for 20 min and then were blocked with 1% Bovine Serum Albumin (BSA). The sections were incubated overnight with anti-EGFR antibody (Santa Cruz). After washing, the sections were incubated with anti-rabbit Alexa Fluor 488 (Molecular Probes) and Streptavidin conjugated Alexa Fluor 594 (Molecular Probes). Coverslips were mounted with one drop of Prolong Gold anti-fade reagent with DAPI (4,6-diamidino-2-phenylindole; Molecular Probes) to visualize the nuclei. Fluorescence images were acquired using a DP70 camera fitted on an Olympus 1X-71 microscope.","Peptide Binding Assay","UMSCC1 cells (1\u00d710) were scraped in PBS containing protease and phosphatase inhibitors, then frozen and thawed three times using dry ice. Next, supernatant was collected and incubated with 3 or 10 \u03bcg\/ml of biotinylated peptide for 1 hour at 37\u00b0 C., followed by the addition of 20 \u03bcl of Streptavidin agarose beads (EZview red Streptavidin affinity gel, Sigma). Samples were rotated overnight at 4\u00b0 C., boiled in 30 \u03bcl of Laemmli buffer at 100\u00b0 C. for 10 minutes, and immunoblotted for HSP90 to detect binding with peptide.","ATP Binding Assay","Cell lysates were prepared in RIPA buffer. About 500 \u03bcg protein was incubated overnight at 4\u00b0 C. with 25 \u03bcl of \u03b3-linked ATP-Agarose beads (Innova Biosciences). After centrifugation, beads were washed in PBS 6 times and ATP bound proteins were extracted in Laemilli buffer, resolved on a SDS page and immunoblotted with anti-HSP90 antibody to detect change in ATP bound HSP90 levels.","In Vivo Tumor Growth Studies","Mice were handled according to the established procedures of the University of Michigan Laboratory Animals Maintenance Manual. To generate tumor xenografts, 2\u00d710UMSCC1 cells were transplanted into the flanks of athymic nude Foxn1mice (Harlan Laboratories). When tumors reached a volume of \u02dc50 mm, the mice were randomized into 3 groups (1 untreated control and 2 experimental groups for specific and non-specific peptides) containing from 15 to 25 tumors, and treatment was initiated.","Live Cell Imaging to Monitor Autophagy:","Change in LC3 localization upon EGFR degradation after treatment with peptide was monitored in live HeLa cells that were stably expressing LC3B-GFP construct. LC3-I is converted to LC3-II during autophagy, and causes the autophagosomes to appear as punctate spots using a fluorescent microscope. HeLa-LC3-GFP cells were plated in optically clear multi-chamber slides. After overnight incubation with cell permeable peptide, change in LC3 expression was monitored. Chloroquine (8 \u03bcM) which stabilizes LC3 autophagosomes, was used as a positive control.","Statistics","Tumor volume doubling was determined for each xenograft by identifying the earliest day on which it was at least twice as large as on the first day of treatment. A cubic smoothing spline was used to obtain the exact time of doubling, and the Kaplan-Meier method was used to analyze the doubling times derived from the smoothed growth curves. The log rank test was used for comparisons between any two treatment groups. Results are presented as mean\u00b1SEM, and Student's t test was used to assess the statistical significance of differences. A significance level threshold of P<0.05 was used.","The following studies were carried out using the materials and methods described Example 1.","EGFR Physically Interacts with HSP90","To determine whether EGFR directly interacts with HSP90, 11 cancer and 2 normal cell lines that express different levels of EGFR were selected and immunoprecipitation of HSP90 followed by immunoblotting for EGFR was performed. It was found that EGFR was consistently immunoprecipitated with HSP90 (, and ) although the degree of interaction varied across these lines. This interaction was confirmed by immunoprecipitating EGFR and immunoblotting with HSP90 antibody (). To further confirm EGFR-HSP90 interaction, a FLAG-tagged HSP90 was expressed in UMSCC11B cells, immunoprecipitated FLAG and immunoblotted for EGFR. It was found that ectopically expressed HSP90 also interacted with endogenous EGFR (). This interaction was reduced upon treatment with geldanamycin (GA), an inhibitor of HSP90 activity. Since both EGFR and HSP90 are known to interact with ErbB2, we next sought to determine whether the EGFR-HSP90 interaction was direct or via ErbB2. When we expressed full length EGFR in CHO cells, which are ErbB2 negative, EGFR was immunoprecipitated using HSP90 antibody (). Likewise, GST pull-down assays demonstrated a direct physical interaction between EGFR and HSP90 (). These results show that the EGFR-HSP90 interaction is direct and not mediated by heterodimerization of EGFR with ErbB2.","Identification of a Potential Binding Region of HSP90 on EGFR","Because the interaction between ErbB2 and HSP90 involves the kinase domain of ErbB2, we hypothesized that the kinase domain of EGFR might also contain the HSP90 binding region. Therefore, we constructed mutants of EGFR based on the binding region of ErbB2 with HSP90, expressed them in CHO cells and assessed their interactions with HSP90. We began with a construct with six substitutions in this region (768-773 EGFR; SVDNPH (SEQ ID NO: 15) to NHVPSD (SEQ ID NO: 35)) by scrambling the amino acids from the native sequence. There was almost no interaction between HSP90 and the 768-773 EGFR construct (). We then constructed mutants with only single and double substitutions (S768A, S768D, S768I, D770G, DN770-771AA, and P772G). Immunoprecipitation of HSP90 revealed that S768D and S768I, D770G and P772G -EGFR had a similar interaction with HSP90 as WT-EGFR. We found a decrease in interaction with HSP90 in the S768A-EGFR expressing cells. The interaction was slightly decreased in the case of the double mutant DN770-771AA (). These results demonstrate that the interaction between EGFR and HSP90 does not depend on a single amino acid but on the 6 amino acids from 768 to 773.","As we expected HSP90 to stabilize EGFR, we anticipated that EGFR expression would correlate with HSP90 binding. Indeed, the two constructs S768A and DN770-771AA were expressed in lower amounts compared to the WT-EGFR, whereas the 768-773 EGFR construct that shows minimum interaction with HSP90 was expressed at significantly lower levels than either single or double EGFR mutants. However, we needed to rule out the possibility that this finding was due to the decreased expression of EGFR. We hypothesized that if decreased EGFR levels in cells transfected with the 768-773 EGFR construct were due to a decrease in its interaction with HSP90, then restoration of EGFR levels by inhibiting degradation would not restore the EGFR-HSP90 interaction. We expressed the 768-773 EGFR and WT-EGFR construct in CHO cells, treated cells with a proteasomal inhibitor MG132 (5 \u03bcM)) for 8 hours, and assessed whether restoration of EGFR levels via blockade of protein degradation caused any change in the EGFR-HSP90 interaction. We found that MG132 pretreatment caused a significant increase in 768-773 EGFR levels (), but that the interaction of expressed 768-773 EGFR with HSP90 still remained low when compared to the WT-EGFR. To further test our hypothesis that 768-773 EGFR might be vulnerable to degradation due to its decreased binding with HSP90, we expressed the WT and 768-773 EGFR constructs in CHO cells and treated with cycloheximide (CHX, 50 \u03bcg\/ml) to block protein synthesis. EGFR levels were reduced by 30% in WT-EGFR expressing cells at 3 hours and by 50% at 6 hours. However, levels of 768-773 EGFR were reduced by about 90% within 3 hours, showing that 768-773 EGFR is a significantly less stable protein than WT-EGFR (). These results demonstrate that the decrease in 768-773 EGFR-HSP90 interaction is not due simply to lowered expression of 768-773 EGFR.","Specificity and Efficacy of EGFR-HSP90 Interaction Inhibitory Peptide","We next sought to target EGFR for degradation by use of peptides that would competitively inhibit EGFR-HSP90 binding.

hours (). We then assessed colonogenic survival in head and neck (UMSCC1, UMSCC10B, UMSCC74B), lung (A549, H1975, H3255), and HeLa cancer cells. Normal human esophageal squamous epithelial (Het1A) and lung fibroblast (MRC5) cell lines along with EGFR negative CHO cells were selected to study selectivity. The EGFR specific peptide reduced the surviving fraction of the cancer cell lines containing WT-EGFR, including UMSCC1 (0.76\u00b10.02), UMSCC10B (0.63\u00b10.06), UMSCC74B (0.74\u00b10.15) HeLa (0.72\u00b10.05), and A549 (0.57\u00b10.11), as well as in H1975, which contains the T790M mutation and is resistant to erlotinib, (0.40\u00b10.08) and H3255 (containing the L858R EGFR mutation and is sensitive to erlotinib, 0.71\u00b10.05) (Table 2b). The peptide did not affect the normal cell lines.","The specific peptide directly interacts with HSP90 and disrupts the EGFR-HSP90 interaction","To determine whether the EGFR specific peptide directly interacts with HSP90, we carried out affinity purification of the biotinylated-peptides in two cancer (UMSCC1, H1975) and two normal cell lines (Het1A and MRC5). HSP90 protein binding was increased (5 to 10 fold) only with the EGFR specific peptide in cancer cells but not in the normal cells (). We also found a concentration-dependent increase in the binding of the specific peptide with HSP90 (). Next, we sought to determine whether the specific peptide disrupted EGFR-HSP90 interactions in tumor cells relative to normal cells. The HSP90 inhibitor geldanamycin (GA) (50 nM), was used as positive control. After a 24-hour exposure to specific peptide, EGFR-HSP90 interaction was significantly reduced in the cancer cell lines, which was comparable with GA treatment, but there was no effect in response to the non-specific peptide in the tumor cells or specific peptide in normal cells (). Peptide treatment affected neither HSP90 activity as assessed by HSP90 and ATP binding in UMSCC1 cells (), nor the levels of either HSP90 or HSP70, both of which were elevated by the HSP90 ATPase inhibitor GA (). We subsequently observed a loss of EGFR protein () and clonogenic survival (and Table II) in tumor cells at 72 h post treatment. These findings demonstrate that the specific peptide binds with HSP90, disrupts EGFR-HSP90 interaction, decreases EGFR stability of both wild type and erlotinib resistant T790M-EGFR, and decreases clonogenic survival, recapitulating the effect of 768-773 mutation on EGFR.","Effects of the Specific Peptide on EGFR Levels in Human Xenografts","To determine the effects of the specific peptide on EGFR levels in vivo, we injected these peptides into nude mice bearing established UMSCC1 xenografts. We found that specific peptides were detectable in xenografts as early as one day and remained detectable 72 hours post injection () and caused a reduction in EGFR immunostaining. To determine the specificity and long term effects of the EGFR specific peptide, we harvested tumors along with normal adjacent tissue on day 18 post treatment. EGFR, but not HSP90, staining was decreased in sections from the tumor xenografts of specific-peptide treated mice, but was unchanged in the adjacent normal tissue (). These results suggest that although the EGFR kinase domain is 100% conserved between mouse and human, the peptide preferentially targets EGFR in the tumor cells and does not seem to affect EGFR in the normal cells.","Tumor lysates were also analyzed for the levels of EGFR, HER2, HER3, pERK, tERK, HSP90 and GAPDH. Disruptin treatment caused a marked reduction in EGFR and pERK levels, whereas, HER2, HER3 levels were largely unaffected.","We then assessed the effect of the peptides on tumor growth in UMSCC1 xenografts (and ). A single dose of specific peptide significantly increased median tumor doubling time (16 days) compared with both mock treated and non-specific peptide treated mice (5.5 days) (P=0.0002) (data not shown). The administration of two injections of the peptide (3 days apart) significantly increased median tumor doubling time (>22 days) compared with the mock-treated group (5.5 days) (P<0.0001) (). No systemic toxicity was observed. We found that there was no difference between any of the treatment groups in either Ki67 or ApopTag staining 18 days after treatment (), suggesting that the tumor response was independent of cell proliferation or apoptosis. We then stained these samples with LC3B antibody, which is a marker for autophagic death. We found an increase in LC3B punctate staining in tumors that were treated with specific peptide compared to either non-specific peptide or DMSO treated control. These findings were further confirmed in cultured HeLa cells that stably express LC3B-GFP fusion protein (), suggesting that the response is due to an induction of autophagy. The effect of Disruptin treatment on micro-blood vessel density in the samples was analyzed by CD31 immunostaining and is shown in .","The effect of Disruptin on tumor growth in NCI-H1975 xenografts was also assessed in comparison to erlotinib. To generate tumor xenografts, 2\u00d710NCI-H1975 cells were transplanted into the flanks of athymic nude Foxn1mice (Harlan Laboratories). When tumors reached a volume of about 50 mm, the mice were randomed into treatment groups and Disruptin treatment as described for the UMSCC1 xenograft mice above was initiated except that the NCI-H1975 bearing animals were also treated daily with erlotinib (100 mg\/kg, p.o., one week). As shown in -, Disruptin also increased tumor doubling time in the NCI-H1975 bearing animals.","To assess the efficacy of a peptide of the present disclosures against tumors expressing either wild-type or erlotinib-resistant EGFR, grown as xenografts, four different cell lines that contain either WT or mutant EGFR are implanted into the mice of a treatment group (10 mice per group) to produce xenografts. A total of 160 mice are used (4 cell lines\u00d74 treatment groups\u00d710 mice per group). Each mouse is prepared with two tumors. Once the tumor has reached about 100 mm, mice are randomized into 4 groups containing at least 10 animals per group. Mice are then given (a) specific peptide (8 mg\/kg, ip, day 1 and 3) (b) non-specific peptide (same as specific peptide), (c) erlotinib (80 mg\/kg, oral, 5 doses), (d) DMSO (same as specific peptide). Three mice are sacrificed to take out 6 tumors on day 3 and 6 tumors on day 18 to assess the effect on EGFR-HSP90 interaction by immunoprecipitation and on EGFR degradation by immunoblotting and immunofluorescence analysis of EGFR and key down-stream signaling molecules, such as pAKT, pERK1\/2 (as described previously (Nyati et al., 10: 691-700 (2004)). The effect of treatment on apoptosis and cell proliferation are assessed by TUNEL and Ki-67 staining. The remaining tumors are monitored for growth for 60 days or until tumors have reached a maximum of 1 cm\u00d71 cm.","The median growth rate or time to doubling for each cell line in each treatment is determined. Linear contrasts are used to test the effect of treatment on growth rates overall, and within cell line types. Cox proportional hazards regression models are utilized to test for differences in doubling times while allowing inclusion of data from tumors removed on days 3 and 18 (censored if volume not doubled at time of removal). Treatment, cell line and their interaction are included as covariates. An overall comparison between two treatment groups is obtained by stratifying the analysis on cell line. Pairwise comparisons of particular interest include peptide vs. control, peptide+cisplatin vs. cisplatin and peptide+cisplatin vs. peptide.","To assess the efficacy and mechanism of EGFR degradation induced by treatment with a compound of the present disclosures, and the role of this treatment in chemo and radiosensitivity, two cell lines from Example 3 are selected: one that expresses WT-EGFR and second that expresses T790M-EGFR for combination studies. Mice are prepared as described in Example 3 and are given a combination treatment wherein either a control peptide or a peptide compound of the present disclosures are administered followed by a single dose of cisplatin (5 mg\/kg), or 5 radiation treatments (i.e. Mon-Fri, 2Gy per fraction). In this experiment, each group will contain at least 10 mice per group and 180 mice in total are used (2 cell lines\u00d79 treatment groups\u00d710 mice per group). Three mice are sacrificed on days 3 and 18 to assess the effect on EGFR-HSP90 interaction by immunoblotting, immunoprecipitation and by immunofluorescence analysis as described in Example 3. The remaining tumors are monitored for growth for 60 days or until tumors have reached a maximum of 1 cm\u00d71 cm.","The median growth rate or time to doubling for each cell line in each treatment is determined.

Pairwise comparisons of particular interest include peptide vs. control, peptide+cisplatin vs. cisplatin and peptide+cisplatin vs. peptide.","The safety of Disruptin compared to geldanamycin in immune-competent C57BL\/6 mice was investigated.","Mice were dosed by intraperitoneal injection with 10 and 30 mg\/kg of Disruptin, and brain, lung, liver, heart, kidneys, spleen, stomach, small intestine, mesenteric lymph nodes, cecum, colon, pancreas, ovaries, bone marrow, and eyes were evaluated 3 days post-injection. There were no histological alterations in the evaluated organs after treatment with Disruptin or the scrambled peptide at either dose tested. In contrast, mice treated with geldanamycin showed histological evidence of toxicity in eye and liver. Complete blood counts and liver cytosolic enzymes (AST, ALT) were not significantly different from controls in the Disruptin and scrambled peptide treated mice at either dose. These results suggest that Disruptin, at an effective dose, was well-tolerated and lacked the adverse effects seen in geldanamycin treated mice.","The effect of Disruptin (peptide #2) on capillary sprouting was assessed in human dermal microvascular cells.","The cells were seeded in 24-well plates coated with growth factor reduced Matrigel (BD Biosciences, Bedford, Mass., USA). The wells were then treated on day 1 with the scrambled peptide (peptide #8) and Disruptin (100 \u03bcg\/ml). Three days after treatment, the capillary branches were counted and analyzed. It was found that network had degenerated in the Disruptin-treated wells. Cell death was assessed by Propidium Iodide staining.  shows the reduced percentage of capillary sprouting in Disruptin-treated wells as compared to the scrambled peptide-treated wells.","All references, including publications, patent applications, and patents, cited herein are hereby incorporated by reference to the same extent as if each reference were individually and specifically indicated to be incorporated by reference and were set forth in its entirety herein.","The use of the terms \u201ca\u201d and \u201can\u201d and \u201cthe\u201d and similar referents in the context of describing the invention (especially in the context of the following claims) are to be construed to cover both the singular and the plural, unless otherwise indicated herein or clearly contradicted by context.
