{"@attributes":{"id":"description"},"BRFSUM":[{},{}],"heading":["TECHNICAL FIELD","BACKGROUND ART","DISCLOSURE OF INVENTION","BEST MODE FOR CARRYING OUT THE INVENTION","First Embodiment","Second Embodiment","Third Embodiment","INDUSTRIAL APPLICABILITY"],"p":["The present invention relates generally to a video signal processing apparatus, a video signal recording apparatus, a video signal reproduction apparatus, and processing methods and a recording medium therefor.","Recently, the use of metadata associated with taken video materials (such as video data) has been becoming popular in the field of the production of video works such as TV programs and video content. The effective use of such metadata requires the compatibility in metadata between a plurality of equipment units for use in the production of video works. For example, situations where the metadata generated by a video signal recording apparatus such as a video camera is used by a video signal reproduction apparatus such as editing equipment require the compatibility of the metadata to be shared therebetween.","Conventionally, however, the notation forms and semantics of the above-mentioned metadata lack integrity and therefore there is no compatibility at all between the notation forms and semantics even in the same uses of the metadata. In such a situation, the standardization of metadata notation forms has been pursued. As a result, the description of metadata in XML (extensible Markup Language) or the like that is high in universality has come to use, attempting the standardization. However, currently, this standardization attempt is not completely successful because there still remain variations in metadata notation format owing to the different concepts and purposes of standardization organizations.","On the other hand, because each user ultimately uses metadata for the purpose of satisfying the individual demands, the diversification of metadata formats is unavoidable to some extent. In other words, it would be unlikely for a certain single metadata format to be widely used in all video work production fields, now and in the future. Even if this would become a reality, the demands for addition and extension of metadata formats due to individual users' needs still remain.","In order to cope with highly various metadata formats, a conversion tool and a conversion table compatible with each metadata format must be developed. Even if such a conversion tool is of an independent, general-purpose one, the conversion table has no other choice but be unique to each metadata notation format, so that the conversion table such as above must be prepared every time the conversion between metadata formats takes place.","Consequently, the related-art technologies present a problem of the inability of each equipment unit for use in the production of video works to flexibly cope with various metadata notation formats. This problem makes it difficult to promptly and smoothly pass metadata between a plurality of these equipment units.","It is therefore an object of the present invention to provide a novel and improved video signal processing apparatus and processing method therefor that are capable of flexibly coping with various metadata notation formats.","It is therefore an object of the present invention to provide a novel and improved video signal processing apparatus and processing method therefor that are capable of flexibly coping with various metadata notation formats.","In carrying out the invention and according to a first aspect thereof, there is provided a video signal processing apparatus for processing video signals. This video signal processing apparatus has a metadata notation format identification block for identifying a notation format of metadata written in a predetermined language; a conversion table selection block for selecting a conversion table corresponding to the identified notation format of the metadata from among one or more conversion tables prepared in advance; a metadata notation format conversion block for converting the notation format of the metadata into a notation format compatible with the video signal processing apparatus on the basis of the selected conversion table; and a processing control block for controlling processing associated with the video signal on the basis of the metadata whose notation format has been converted.","The above-mentioned novel configuration allows the video signal processing apparatus to flexibly handle the metadata having a given notation format written in a predetermined language. Namely, the metadata notation format identification block is capable of identifying the notation format of externally acquired metadata. The conversion table selection block is capable of selecting a conversion table specifying rules of conversion between the notation format identified by the metadata notation format identification block and the notation format recognizable inside the video signal processing apparatus. Further, the metadata notation format conversion block is capable of converting the notation format of the acquired metadata into the notation format recognizable inside the video signal processing apparatus in accordance with the conversion rules specified in the conversion table selected by the conversion table selection block. The processing control block is capable of recognizing and processing the metadata whose notation format has been converted by the metadata notation format conversion block, thereby executing various processing operations in the video signal processing apparatus using that metadata.","It should be noted that the notation format (or schema) of metadata includes metadata form, data type, structure, document definition, attribute representation type, and other metadata types.","The above-mentioned metadata notation format identification block may be configured to identify a metadata notation format by detecting a tag from metadata written in a markup language. This configuration allows the metadata notation format identification block to easily and quickly identify a metadata notation format simply by detecting a start tag for example from metadata written in a markup language that is a tag language.","The above-mentioned video signal processing apparatus may also be configured as a video signal recording apparatus for recording video signals to a recording apparatus or a video signal reproduction processing apparatus for reproducing video signals.","In carrying out the invention and according to a second aspect thereof, there is provided a computer-readable recording medium recording a program for making a computer function as the above-mentioned video signal processing apparatus.","In carrying out the invention and according to a third aspect thereof, there is provided a processing method for a video signal processing apparatus for processing video signals. This processing method for the video signal processing apparatus includes the steps of: identifying a notation format of metadata written in a predetermined language; selecting a conversion table corresponding to the identified notation format of the metadata from among one or more conversion tables prepared in advance; converting the notation format of the metadata into a notation format compatible with the video signal processing apparatus on the basis of the selected conversion table; and controlling processing associated with the video signal on the basis of the metadata whose notation format has been converted. This novel configuration allows the video signal processing apparatus to flexibly handle the metadata having a given notation format written in a predetermined language.","In carrying out the invention and according to a fourth aspect thereof, there is provided a video signal recording apparatus for recording video signals to a recording medium. This video signal recording apparatus has a metadata generating block for generating metadata associated with the video signal by writing the metadata in a predetermined language; a metadata notation format conversion block for converting at least a notation format of the generated metadata into a notation format compatible with a video signal reproduction apparatus for reproducing the video signal recorded to the recording medium, on the basis of one or more conversion tables prepared in advance; and a video signal recording block for recording the metadata whose notation format has been converted and the video signal in a related manner so as to allow the video signal reproduction apparatus to control processing associated with the video signal on the basis of the metadata.","This novel configuration allows the video signal recording apparatus to provide the metadata generated by itself to the video signal reproduction apparatus along with video data. At this moment, the video recording apparatus is capable of executing preliminary processing of converting the notation format of the metadata generated by itself into a notation format compatible with the video signal reproduction apparatus before providing the metadata to the video signal reproduction apparatus. Consequently, the video signal reproduction apparatus becomes able to recognize and process the metadata recorded to a recording medium acquired from the video signal recording apparatus without having a special apparatus. Thus, the novel configuration makes it unnecessary for the video signal recording apparatus to forcibly apply the metadata notation format thereof to the video signal reproduction apparatus.","In carrying out the invention and according to a fifth aspect thereof, there is provided a computer-readable recording medium recording a program for making a computer function as the above-mentioned video signal recording apparatus.","In carrying out the invention and according to a sixth aspect thereof, there is provided a processing method for a video signal recording apparatus for recording video signals to a recording medium. This processing method for the video signal recording apparatus has the steps of: generating metadata associated with the video signal by writing the metadata in a predetermined language; converting at least a notation format of the generated metadata into a notation format compatible with a video signal reproduction apparatus for reproducing the video signal recorded to the recording medium, on the basis of one or more conversion tables prepared in advance; and recording the metadata whose notation format has been converted and the video data in a related manner so as to allow the video signal reproduction apparatus to control processing associated with the video signal on the basis of the metadata. This novel configuration allows the video signal recording apparatus to convert the notation format of the metadata generated by itself into a notation format compatible with the video signal reproduction apparatus before providing the metadata thereto.","In carrying out the invention and according to a seventh aspect thereof, there is provided a video signal recording apparatus for recording video signals to a recording medium. This video signal recording apparatus has a metadata generating block for generating metadata associated with the video signal by writing the metadata in a predetermined language; a conversion table selection block for selecting at least one conversion table from among one or more conversion tables prepared in advance; and a video signal recording block for recording at least the generated metadata, the selected conversion table, and the video data in a related manner to the recording medium so as to allow a video signal reproduction apparatus for reproducing the video signal recorded to the recording medium to control processing associated with the video signal on the basis of the metadata.","This novel configuration allows the video signal recording apparatus to provide the metadata generated by itself and a conversion table corresponding to this metadata to the video signal reproduction apparatus along with video data. Namely, in consideration of the video signal reproduction apparatus that uses video signals and metadata, the video signal recording apparatus that provides these video signals and metadata is capable of providing the conversion table corresponding to the metadata along with unconverted metadata so that the video data reproduction apparatus can easily convert the notation format of the metadata generated by the video signal recording apparatus and use the converted metadata. Consequently, the video signal reproduction apparatus becomes able to easily convert the notation format of the metadata recorded to a recording medium from the video signal recording apparatus and recognize and process the converted metadata. Thus, the novel configuration makes it unnecessary for the video signal recording apparatus to forcibly apply the metadata notation format thereof to the video signal reproduction apparatus.","In carrying out the invention and according to eighth aspect thereof, there is provided a computer-readable recording medium recording a program for making a computer function as the above-mentioned video signal processing apparatus.","In carrying out the invention and according to a ninth aspect thereof, there is provided a processing method for a video signal recording apparatus for recording video signals to a recording medium.

This novel configuration allows the video signal recording apparatus to provide the metadata generated by itself and a conversion table necessary for converting the notation format of the metadata to the video signal reproduction apparatus along with video data via the recording medium.","In carrying out the invention and according to a tenth aspect thereof, there is provided a video signal reproduction apparatus for reproducing video signals recorded to a recording medium.

This novel configuration allows the video signal reproduction apparatus to easily convert the notation format of metadata acquired from the video signal recording apparatus into a notation format compatible with itself by use of a conversion table read from the recording medium.","This invention will be described in further detail by way of example with reference to the accompanying drawings. It should be noted that components having substantially the same functional configuration are denoted by the same reference numerals throughout the present specification and the accompanying drawings thereof to omit duplicate description for the brevity of description.","The following describes a first embodiment of the invention. A video signal processing apparatus practiced as the first embodiment is capable of converting acquired metadata having a notation format incompatible with this apparatus into a notation format compatible therewith and executing processing associated with various types of video signals on the basis of the converted metadata. The following describes the video signal processing apparatus for realizing the above-mentioned feature.","1. Video Program Production Support System","First, an overall configuration of a video program production support system for which the video signal processing apparatus associated with the first embodiment is employed will be described.","The video program production support system is installed in television stations and production companies for producing video content and movies for example and supports the production of video programs that are video works such as television programs, video content, and movies for example. The characteristic of the video program production support system according to the first embodiment is that the metadata of electronic file format (details thereof will be described later) may be used in common between a plurality of terminal apparatuses used in the departments that produce video programs in a shared manner.","Now, referring to , a configuration of the video program production support system according to the first embodiment will be described.  is a block diagram illustrating an approximate configuration of the video program production support system according to the first embodiment.","As shown in , the video program production support system  is mainly configured by a network , a planning terminal , a material gathering terminal apparatus  made up of an imaging apparatus  and a field PC\/PDA (hereafter referred to as a field PC) , and an editing terminal apparatus , for example.","The network  is an electrical communication line network for interconnecting the planning terminal apparatus , the imaging apparatus , the field PC , and the editing terminal apparatus , for example, in a bidirectionally communicable manner. In the first embodiment, the network  is made up of a wired communication line such as RS-422 or RS-232C and a wireless communication line such as the IEEE 802.11a standard, for example. However, the network  is not restricted to the above-mentioned configuration; for example, the network  may be made up of a fiber optics network such as FDDI (Fiber Distributed Data Interface), a communication satellite network, Ethernet (trademark), a LAN, the Internet, or any of other various dedicated or public switched line networks.","The network  as described above is capable of transmitting the metadata generated by the planning terminal apparatus  to the imaging apparatus  and field PC  (namely, the material gathering terminal apparatus ), for example. Also, the network  is capable of transmitting the video data recorded by the imaging apparatus  and the metadata generated and edited by the imaging apparatus  and the field PC  to the editing terminal apparatus  for example.","It should be noted that the video program production support system  may not always have the network  such as mentioned above. If the video program production support system  has no network , then metadata and so on may be transferred between the terminal apparatuses via various recording media such as an optical disk , a memory card, a memory stick, and a magnetic disk, for example.","The planning terminal apparatus , the material gathering terminal apparatus , and the editing terminal apparatus  are used by a planning and organization department, a material gathering department, and an editing department respectively, for example.","The planning terminal apparatus  is based on an information processing apparatus such as a personal computer and peripheral units thereof for example and installed in the planning and organization department. The planning and organization department controls the entire production of each video program, executing the planning and conceptualization of each program to be produced to create scenarios and transmits the information about the production work to other departments such as the material gathering department and the editing department.","The planning terminal apparatus  has a metadata generation block (not shown) for generating metadata of an electronic file format. The metadata generation block is configured by installing the application software for generating metadata into the planning terminal apparatus , for example. The metadata generation block is capable of acquiring metadata content on the basis of inputs made by personnel of the planning and organization department and creating a metadata file by describing the content in a predetermined notation format (or schema) of a predetermined language such as XML for example. It should be noted that this metadata notation format may be any notation format that the planning terminal apparatus  is capable of handling (or recognizing), for example.","The planning terminal apparatus  configured as such is capable of generating program metadata (of which details will be described later) for each video program. To be more specific, the planning terminal apparatus  creates a framework of the above-mentioned metadata. Further, the planning terminal apparatus  generates production instruction information on the basis of inputs made by personnel of the planning and organization department and writes the generated information to corresponding columns in the created program metadata. The production instruction information provides instructions given by the planning and organization department to other departments for the details of the production of each video program; namely, the production instruction information is equivalent to a scenario created by the planning and organization department.","The planning terminal apparatus  is also capable of providing the metadata generated as described above to the material gathering terminal apparatus  for example. The provision of metadata may be made by the transmission via the network  or realized by means of recording media such as a memory card, for example. The provision by the planning terminal apparatus  of the program metadata including the above-mentioned production instruction information to the material gathering terminal apparatus  for example allows the planning and organization department to instruct the material gathering department for example for scenes to be covered and imaged and the content thereof for example.","The material gathering terminal apparatus  is a group of terminals that are used by the material gathering department and is made up of the imaging apparatus  and the field PC  for example. The material gathering department actually gathers materials at production sites, taking the images of each of the scenes forming each video program and gathering taking situations.","The imaging apparatus  is a video camera such as a camcorder for use in gathering materials for broadcast news programs and imaging video content such as game scenes including sports and movies. In the first embodiment, the imaging apparatus  is a video signal processing apparatus and configured as a video signal recording apparatus for recording taken video signals.","To be more specific, the imaging apparatus  is capable of taking video (including audio) each of scenes forming each video program, for example. This taking processing proceeds by repeating take two or more times. For example, the imaging apparatus  makes one or more takes for a certain scene and then one or more takes for another scene. It should be noted that this take denotes a continuous imaging processing from the starting of recording of one session to the end of recording. In other words, this take provides the minimum unit of imaging processing in the imaging phase of each video program. In the fields of video work production, this take is also called \u201cclip\u201d, \u201cshot\u201d, or \u201ccut\u201d, for example.","In addition, the imaging apparatus  is capable of recording video signals (image signals and\/or audio signals) to a recording medium such as an optical disk . In other words, the imaging apparatus  is capable of recording the video data generated by imaging processing to corresponding recording media, for example. This video data is the video data and\/or audio data representative of the contents taken by the imaging apparatus . Such video data is made up of moving image data such as TV program and movie, still image data such as photograph and drawing, audio data such as radio program, subtitle data, or combinations thereof. Further, the imaging apparatus  is capable of recording such video data for each take described above. To be more specific, if the imaging apparatus  executes take two times for example, two video data files are recorded.","The optical disk  to which the above-mentioned video data is recorded is configured in the first embodiment as a mass-storage, next-generation optical disk capable of recording video data of a very large size (several hundred giga bytes for example), for example. However, the optical disk  is not restricted to this optical disk; for example, any of various optical disk such as DVD-R, DVD-ROM, DVD-RAM, CD-R, and CD-ROM may also be available. The recording medium to which the imaging apparatus  records video data is not restricted to the example of the optical disk ; for example, a magneto-optical disk such as MO, a magnetic disk such as flexible disk, a magnetic tape such as digital VTR format video tape, or any of various types of RAMs and ROMs may also be available.","In addition, the imaging apparatus  is capable of recording not only original video but also low-resolution video to the optical disk  as video data, for example. The original video as used herein denotes the raw video data as taken by the imaging apparatus . This original video is large in size but high in picture quality and therefore used as a finished video program product. On the other hand, the low-resolution video is the video data obtained by compressing the above-mentioned original video. This low-resolution video is comparatively low in picture quality but small in size and therefore quick and easy in transmission, thereby mainly making it suitable for use in the preliminary editing phase.","Further, the features of the imaging apparatus  associated with the first embodiment of the invention are as follows. Namely, the imaging apparatus  is capable of acquiring various kinds of metadata from an external device such as the above-mentioned planning terminal apparatus  via the network  or recording media, for example. The imaging apparatus  is also capable of converting the notation format of the metadata acquired from the outside as described above into the notation formation compatible with the imaging apparatus . In addition, the imaging apparatus  is capable of controlling various processing operations on the basis of the metadata that has become recognizable by the imaging apparatus  by the above-mentioned conversion.","The imaging apparatus  is also capable of editing the above-mentioned acquired metadata. Moreover, the imaging apparatus  is capable of generating metadata such as take metadata (of which details will be described later) on its own. The above-mentioned editing and generation of metadata are executed by describing the metadata in XML for example. The metadata notation format used here may be a notation format with which the imaging apparatus  itself is compatible, for example. The details of the above-mentioned features of the imaging apparatus  will be described later.","On the other hand, the field PC  is based on a note-type personal computer or a portable computer such as PDA (Personal Digital Assistant) and peripheral devices thereof, for example. The field PC  is connected with the above-mentioned imaging apparatus  by various wired or wireless lines and is capable of sharing metadata and recorded video data for example with the imaging apparatus .","The field PC  is capable of acquiring metadata from the planning terminal apparatus  or the imaging apparatus  via the network  or recording media, for example. In addition, the field PC  may be configured so as to have substantially the same function as the metadata conversion function of the imaging apparatus  to be described later. As a result, the field PC  becomes able to convert the notation format of the acquired metadata into the notation format compatible with the field PC , thereby controlling its various processing operations on the basis of the metadata made recognizable by the field PC  by the above-mentioned conversion.","In one example of the above-mentioned processing operations, the field PC  is capable of displaying the acquired metadata onto a predetermined display block to make the contents of the metadata recognizable by the personnel of the material gathering department. Also, on the basis of the input made by the personnel of the material gathering department, the field PC  is capable of adding shooting situation information that is the metadata associated with the shooting situation at material gathering to the above-mentioned program metadata, for example.","Thus, the field PC  is capable of editing the acquired metadata, for example. The metadata editing function of the field PC  may be realized by installing metadata editing application software in the field PC . It should be noted that the above-mentioned metadata editing processing is executed by describing metadata in XML for example, the metadata notation format at this moment may be any notation format with which the field PC  itself is compatible, for example.","If the notation format with which the field PC  is compatible is the same as the notation format with which the imaging apparatus  is compatible, then the field PC  need not have the above-mentioned metadata conversion function. Namely, by acquiring the converted metadata from the imaging apparatus , the field PC  becomes able to execute various processing operations such as the above-mentioned metadata editing on the basis of the acquired metadata.","The editing terminal apparatus  is made up of an information processing apparatus such as a personal computer and a peripheral device thereof for example and installed in the editing department. The editing department edits the video data recorded by the imaging apparatus  on the basis of the production instruction and scenario received from the above-mentioned planning and organization department and the material gathering situation and shooting condition obtained in the phase of material gathering, thereby completing each video program, for example. In the first embodiment of the invention, the editing terminal apparatus  is the above-mentioned video signal processing apparatus and configured as a video signal reproduction apparatus for reproducing video signals recorded to recording media by the above-mentioned video signal recording apparatus (namely, the imaging apparatus ).","Namely, the editing terminal apparatus  is capable of reproducing the video data recorded to recording media and editing the reproduced video data, for example. To be more specific, for example, the editing terminal apparatus  is capable of acquiring video data from the imaging apparatus  via the optical disk  for example. Also, the editing terminal apparatus  is capable of reproducing the video data recorded to the optical disk  for example individually for each take or continuously in a suitable manner for example, thereby displaying the reproduced video data. In addition, the editing terminal apparatus  is capable of supporting the video data editing processing, for example. This editing processing is made up of preliminary editing processing and main editing processing for example.","In the preliminary editing processing, the video data to be used for editing is collected from a plurality of pieces of video data recorded for each take. Next, from among the collected video data, a necessary video portion is logged. Then, an editing start position (or in-point) or an editing end position (or out-point) corresponding to the logged video portion is set by use of a time code for example, thereby ingesting a necessary portion from among the video data.","In the main editing processing, a plurality of pieces of preliminary-edited video data are extracted and then combined, final picture quality adjustments are executed on the combined video data, thereby creating a complete package data to be broadcast in a television program, for example.","Further, the features of the editing terminal apparatus  associated with the first embodiment of the invention are as follows. Namely, the editing terminal apparatus  is capable of acquiring various kinds of metadata from external devices such as the imaging apparatus  via the network  or the optical disk , for example. Also, the editing terminal apparatus  is capable of converting the notation format of the metadata acquired from the outside into the notation formation with which the editing terminal apparatus  is compatible, for example. In addition, the editing terminal apparatus  is capable of controlling various processing operations associated with video signals on the basis of the metadata that has become recognizable of the editing terminal apparatus  by the above-mentioned conversion.","Moreover, the editing terminal apparatus  is capable of editing the acquired data. The editing processing mentioned above is executed by describing metadata in XML for example. The metadata notation format at this moment may be a notation format with which the editing terminal apparatus  itself is compatible, for example. The above-mentioned features of the editing terminal apparatus  will be detailed later.","Thus, the video program production support system  practiced as the first embodiment of the invention and the components thereof have been overviewed. The video program production support system  is advantageous in that various kinds of metadata associated with the production of each video program are transferred between the plurality of terminal apparatuses (or video signal processing apparatuses) configuring the system regardless of the difference among the notation formats of the metadata, thereby using the metadata for the production of each video program. This advantage is achieved by the capability of the imaging apparatus , the field PC , and the editing terminal apparatus  that receive metadata for flexibly converting the notation format of the received metadata into the notation format that is recognizable by these apparatuses.","2. Metadata","The following describes in detail the metadata associated with the first embodiment of the invention by use of specific examples.","2.1 Overview of Metadata","\u201cMetadata\u201d denotes the high-order data of a certain collection of various kinds of data and provides an index (or a bookmark) indicative of the contents and attributes these data. Specific examples of the above-mentioned metadata include production instruction information data (or scenario data) for indicating the contents of video program production, shooting situation information data associated with the shooting situations obtained at the time of material gathering, shooting condition information data associated with shooting condition and device setup for each take for the video data, take relation information data for relating the video data shot for every take with a scenario, thumbnail data associated with typical still image in the video data, and electronic mark data associated with the feature points of video data content, for example.","The above-mentioned metadata provides very useful information in the production of each video program. For example, by browsing the above-mentioned metadata, the personnel of each department is able to get the index information about the taken video data and check the contents of production instructions and material gathering results and the relationship between scenario and video data. Also, the above-mentioned terminal apparatuses arranged in the above-mentioned departments are capable of automatically recognizing the above-mentioned metadata, thereby acquiring the setup information and the information about the feature points in the video data and understanding the relationship between scenario and video data.","In addition, although the above-mentioned metadata is useful when it is used independently in each department (or each terminal apparatus), configuring the metadata so as to be available among a plurality of departments (or terminal apparatuses) in common further enhances the production efficiency and quality of each video program.","For the metadata to be shared among a plurality of departments and apparatuses as described above, it is preferable for the notation formats of the metadata to be integrated to a certain extent. Therefore, in the first embodiment of the invention, only one language is used for describing metadata. Consequently, the metadata notation formats may be standardized to some extent, thereby enhancing of metadata compatibility. Further, the first embodiment of the invention uses XML for example as the language to describe the above-mentioned metadata. This XML is an extensible markup language and advantageous in enhancing versatility and ease of mastering its comparatively simple syntax. Therefore, describing the metadata in XML allows unspecified users to easy understand and modify the contents of metadata description.","2.2 Program Metadata","The following describes program metadata that is a specific example of the metadata used in the first embodiment of the invention with reference to .  shows an exemplary configuration of the program metadata associated with the first embodiment of the invention.","Program metadata is tabulated data in which various kinds of metadata necessary for the production of each video program are structured (namely, structured table metadata), for example and is managed by one metadata file for each video program.","As shown in , the above-mentioned program metadata has a layered structure formed by a program identification layer, a material gathering layer, a scene layer, and a cut layer in accordance with material gathering, scene, and cut which are components of each program, for example. It should be noted that \u201ccut\u201d as used herein denotes the minimum unit forming each video program at the stage of planning (namely, at the time a scenario is created). In the example shown in , the video program is composed of 13 cuts. \u201cScene\u201d as used herein denotes the intermediate unit forming each video program at the stage of planning and composed of one or more cuts. In the example of , the video program is composed of five scenes. \u201cMaterial gathering\u201d as used herein denotes the maximum unit forming each video program at the stage of planning and is composed of one or more scenes. In the example of , the video program is composed of two scenes. Thus, the program metadata has a tree structure with the program identification layer on top followed downward by the material gathering layer, the scene layer, and the cut layer in this order, the further down, the more segmentalized.","In each layer of program metadata, the material gathering, the scene, and the cut that are entered in upper columns precede in the order of scenarios, for example. For example, of the five scenes forming the video program shown in , the scene entered in the top column is the first scene and the scene entered in the bottom column is the final scene.","The following describes the contents of program metadata having the above-mentioned layered structure. Program metadata includes such metadata as the above-mentioned production instruction information, shooting situation information, and take relating information, for example. Of these pieces of information, the production instruction information and the shooting situation information are constituted as a layer and included in each layer for example. This configuration allows the clear and short representation of the metadata associated with the production instruction (or scenario) of each video program and such intention and recognition of the producer as the information obtained during material gathering. On the other hand, the take relating information is included only in the cut layer for example.

Overview of Metadata Conversion","The following outlines the conversion of the metadata associated with the first embodiment of the invention.","Each of the terminal apparatuses forming the above-mentioned video program production support system  has a metadata application processing block for interpreting XML-based metadata for example and executes predetermined processing on the basis of the interpreted metadata. This metadata application processing block is configured for the metadata having a particular notation format for example and therefore cannot recognize and process the metadata having other notation formats.","On the other hand, with XML, the syntax is strictly specified, so that the notation format of the metadata written in XML may easily be converted by the of XSLT (Extensible Stylesheet Language Transformations) for example. Therefore, installing a conversion engine such as the XSLT engine for example on the input\/output processing block of the above-mentioned metadata application processing block allows the metadata application processing block to cope with the input\/output of the metadata having any notation format.","The following outlines the metadata conversion by use of the above-mentioned XSLT engine with reference to .  schematically illustrates the metadata conversion by use of the XSLT engine associated with the first embodiment of the invention.","As shown in , the metadata input\/output processing block of each terminal apparatus such as the imaging apparatus  has an XSLT engine , for example.

The conversion table  is a conversion definition document defining conversion rules for conversion between the external metadata and the internal metadata, which is an XSL (extensible Stylesheet Language) document.","The conversion table  such as the XSL document and the XSLT engine  are standard technologies generally used in the field of XML and easy in understanding the description contents and structure thereof, with various effective converted data generating tools available. Hence, any user is able to easily customize the conversion table  and the XSLT engine .","The metadata application processing block  arranged in the above-mentioned terminal apparatus is capable of accessing the above-mentioned internal metadata via standard API (Application Programming Interface)  of DOM (Document Object Model) for example. The internal metadata  has been converted by the above-mentioned XSLT engine  into a notation format that can be handled by the metadata application processing block . Therefore, the metadata application processing block  is capable of recognizing the internal metadata  to execute predetermined processing on the basis of the recognized metadata.","As described above, installing a conversion engine such as the XSLT engine  for example into the metadata input\/output processing block allows each terminal apparatus such as the imaging apparatus  to easily recognize and process the metadata having any notation format provided from the outside only by separately preparing the predetermined conversion table .","On the other hand, the XSLT engine  is capable of reversely converting the internal metadata  into the external metadata  having any notation format by use of the conversion table , for example. Consequently, each terminal apparatus is also capable of converting the internally generated and edited metadata into metadata having a notation format for use by external equipment and outputting the converted metadata.","4.

For example, the communication block  receives the metadata provided by an external device and outputs the received metadata to the metadata input\/output processing block . In addition, if the above-mentioned data is transmitted through SDI (Serial Digital Interface) via the network  for example, the communication block  is capable of encoding the data by use of KLV (Key Length Value) encoding for example.","The external interface  allows data transmission and reception with peripheral devices connected to the imaging apparatus  with USB (Universal Serial Bus) or SCSI (Small Computer System Interface) for example. In addition, the external interface  is cable of functioning as an interface for accessing a memory card, a memory stick, a flexible disk, and other recording media for reading\/writing various kinds of data such as metadata.","The camera block  has capabilities of executing imaging processing to generate video data. The camera block  has an imaging block for taking a picture of a subject to output a video signal, a microphone block for picking up sound in the shooting environment to generate an audio signal, a video processor for processing a video signal composed of video signal and audio signal, a video compression block for compressing the video signal by MPEG1 or MPEG2 for example to generate the above-mentioned low-resolution video, and a time code generation block for generating and attaching a time code to video data (all of these blocks not shown), for example.","Of these blocks, the imaging block is composed of an optical block, a drive block, and an imaging device such as CCD (Charge Coupled Device), for example. The optical block is composed of a lens, an aperture diaphragm, and a filter, for example, and throws an optical image of a subject onto the imaging device. The drive block is capable of controlling lens aperture, zoom, exposure, and focusing, for example. The imaging device converts the above-mentioned optical image into an electrical video signal by photoelectrical conversion through a plurality of pixels based on photo conversion elements arranged on a photo reception surface in a two dimensional manner and outputs the electrical video signal.","The video processor performs A\/D conversion processing, gain control (AGC) processing, white balance processing, \u03b3 (gamma) correction processing, shading processing, aperture processing for edge correction, and CDS (Correlated Double Sampling circuit) processing for noise reduction on the video signals generated by the imaging block, for example.

In this point of view, the disk unit  is capable of functioning as a video signal recording block for recording video signals and metadata to a recording medium in a related manner. In addition, the disk unit  is capable to reproducing the video data recorded to the above-mentioned recording medium, for example. Further, the disk unit  is capable of reading the metadata from a recording medium provided from the outside and outputting the read metadata to the metadata input\/output processing block .","The conversion table database  is a feature block associated with the first embodiment of the invention and a recording unit for storing the conversion table of the above-mentioned metadata, for example. This conversion table is an XSL document for example in which the conversion definition between the metadata provided from the outside (namely, the above-mentioned external metadata) and the metadata having a notation format that may be handed by the imaging apparatus  (namely, the above-mentioned internal metadata) is described. The conversion table database  includes a plurality of conversion table for example corresponding to various kinds of external metadata. It should be noted that the above-mentioned conversion table may be provided from the outside via the network  or a recording medium such as memory card or generated inside the imaging apparatus  on the basis of the input made by the material gathering department personnel, for example.","The metadata generation block  has a capability of newly generating metadata such as take metadata, for example.","To be specific, the metadata generation block  is capable of newly creating take metadata for each take and entering the above-mentioned take shooting condition information for example as the content of the created take metadata, for example.","To be more specific, if shooting processing for one take has been executed by the camera block , the metadata generation block  automatically creates a file of the take metadata associated with that take. Next, the metadata generation block  gathers the shooting condition and setup information associated with that take from each block of the imaging apparatus  for example, automatically creating the above-mentioned take shooting condition information. For example, the metadata generation block  is capable of getting, from the above-mentioned time code generation block, the information about the date and time at which the shooting of that take started and, from the memory block  for example, such setting information of the imaging apparatus  as AGC gain level, white balance switch status, and DCC switch on\/off status, for example.

Assume that this external metadata is written in XML for example, but is different in notation format from internal metadata.","The metadata notation format identification block  is capable of detecting tags from the external metadata inputted as described above to identify the notation format of this external metadata. Namely, for the metadata written in XML, the start tag is specified for each type of metadata. Hence, the metadata notation format identification block  is capable of detecting the head or end start tag written in the external metadata for example, thereby identifying the type of that external metadata.","For example, MPEG-7 metadata always starts with tag <Mpeg7> and ends with tag <\/Mpeg7>. Therefore, upon detection of tags <Mpeg7> and <\/Mpeg7>, the metadata notation format identification block  identifies that the metadata concerned is the metadata written in <Mpeg7> format.

The selected conversion table describes the tag name conversion rules for converting the tags in the MOS metadata into the tags of the internal metadata as shown in . For example, the above-mentioned rules specify that tag <afObj> of the MOS metadata be converted into tag <Acquisition> of the internal metadata. Also, the rules specify that tag <afID> of the MOS metadata be converted into tag <Assignment@id> of the internal metadata, for example. The conversion into tag <Assignment\u00aeid> denotes that the contents of element \u201cafID\u201d of the MOS metadata are described as the id attribute of element \u201cAssignment\u201d of the internal metadata.","The metadata notation format conversion block  has a capability of converting the notation format of external metadata into the notation format of internal metadata on the basis of the conversion table selected by the above-mentioned conversion table selection block .

Such an item unique to external metadata is held by converting it into a tag including its name space (to be specific, prefix \u201cmos:\u201d is attached), for example.","For part (\u201cC\u201d and \u201cC\u2032\u201d) to (\u201cc\u201d to \u201cc\u2032\u201d), tag <afObj> is converted into tag <Acquisition> for example.","For part \u201cD\u201d to \u201cd\u201d, tags <afID> and <afSlug> for example are integrally converted into tag <Assignment> for example and the contents of afID and afSlug elements are described as id attribute and title attribute of Assignment element.","For part \u201cD\u201d, tags <photographer>, <reporter>, and <description> for example are converted into tags <Cameraman>, <Reporter>, and <Description> for example.","Thus, the metadata notation format conversion block  is capable of converting the notation format of external metadata into the notation format of internal metadata that may be handled by the metadata application processing block . Therefore, the metadata application processing block  becomes able to recognize and process the metadata thus converted.","It should be noted that the metadata elements of external metadata and internal metadata are not always corresponding to each other one to one, but, by converting items unique to external metadata into tag names including their name spaces and holding these tag names, the metadata application processing block  is capable of not only efficiently skipping these items but also holding the original information if reverse conversion is required, for example.","On the other hand, the items that are defined in internal metadata but do not exist in external metadata (for example, FieldNote and Scene elements) may not simply generated at the conversion into internal metadata.","Next, the metadata application processing block  has a capability of controlling various processing operations such as the processing associated with video signals in the imaging apparatus  on the basis of the metadata with the above-mentioned notation format converted, for example.

These pieces of setup information include lens-associated information such as types of filter and extender, video signal processing values associated with white balance control, shading correction, gamma correction, gain control, and DCC, and switch states, for example. The metadata application processing block  transmits setup commands based on these kinds of setup information to the camera block  for example, thereby controlling each component of the camera block  to the same shooting state as before. Consequently, this allows the imaging apparatus  to be restored to the last shooting status for example.

If the metadata application processing block  has acquired program metadata including production instruction information (namely, a scenario) for example, the metadata application processing block  is capable of relating the video material such as the video data of a shot take with that program metadata.","To be more specific, every time take shooting processing is executed, the metadata application processing block  is capable of automatically generating for example the take relating information composed of the above-mentioned take number, OK\/NG information, video file name, low-resolution file name, and take metadata file name for example and additionally entering the generated information into the column of the cut layer of the above-mentioned program metadata. By entering the take relating information as described above, the metadata application processing block  is capable of relating the video data and make data of the take concerned with the cut in the above-mentioned program metadata. With which cut the video material for example of the take concerned is to be related is determined by a cut selecting operation by the cameraman for example. In the cut selecting operation, the cameraman for example touches panel buttons for example to select a cut for allocating a take to be shot or a already shot take from among a plurality of cuts included in the production instruction information of the program metadata displayed above, for example.","Thus, the metadata application processing block  is capable of additionally enter the generated take relating information into program metadata, thereby editing the program metadata.

The imaging apparatus  gets external metadata from an external device such as the planning terminal apparatus  via the network  or a recording medium, for example. To be more specific, in the acquisition via the network , the communication block  of the imaging apparatus  receives external metadata transmitted via the network  and outputs the received external metadata to the metadata input\/output processing block . On the other hand, in the acquisition via a recording medium, the external interface  or the disk unit  reads external metadata from the recording medium and outputs the external metadata to the metadata input\/output processing block .","Next, in step S, the notation format of the metadata acquired above is identified (step S; metadata notation formation identification process). The metadata notation format identification block  of the metadata input\/output processing block  detects the start tag from the inputted external metadata file to identify the notation format of that external metadata, for example. If tag <mos> is detected for example, the metadata notation format identification block  identifies that the type of that external metadata is MOS metadata.","Further, in step S, the identified metadata notation format is determined whether it is compatible with the imaging apparatus  (step S). For example, the metadata notation format identification block  has, in advance, the knowledge of the metadata notation format (namely, internal metadata notation formats) that can be handled by the metadata application processing block  for example of the imaging apparatus . Therefore, the metadata notation format identification block  is capable of determining whether the notation format of external metadata identified in step S is identical to this known notation format of internal metadata. If the external metadata notation format is found incompatible with the metadata application processing block , then the procedure goes to step S; if the external metadata notation format is found compatible, then the procedure goes to step S.","In step S, the conversion table corresponding to the metadata notation format identified above is selected (step S; conversion table selection process). The conversion table selection block  selects one conversion table corresponding to the external metadata notation format identified in step S and the internal metadata notation format from among a plurality of conversion tables recorded to the conversion table database , for example.","In step S, the conversion of the metadata notation format is executed on the basis of the selected conversion table (step S; metadata conversion process) On the basis of the conversion table selected in step S, the metadata notation format conversion block  converts the external metadata notation format into the internal metadata notation format. Consequently, the notation format of the acquired external metadata is converted into the notation formation that can be recognized by the metadata application processing block .","In step S, various metadata application processing operations are executed (step S; processing control process). On the basis of the metadata made recognizable after notation format conversion, the metadata application processing block  controls various processing operations in the imaging apparatus  as described above, for example.

In recording the metadata, the disk unit  associated with the second embodiment of the invention is capable of recording the metadata concerned and the video data corresponding thereto in a related manner. Techniques of relating metadata with video data and recording the resultant related metadata and video data include on in which a directory configuration in a recording medium is used such as recording a metadata file and a video data file in a same folder or linked folders, for example, or another in which, as with the program metadata take relating information, a video data file name is entered in metadata, for example.","Thus, the recording medium such as the optical disk  to which the converted metadata is recorded is provided to an external device such as the editing terminal apparatus . Consequently, the editing terminal apparatus  for example becomes able to get video data and the metadata related thereto through a same recording medium, for example.","Thus, the functional configuration of the component blocks of the imaging apparatus  have been described. However, the configuration of the imaging apparatus  is not restricted to the above-mentioned exemplary functional configuration.","For example, by transmitting the metadata converted into the above-mentioned other party metadata format via the network , the imaging apparatus  may provide the converted metadata to an external device such as the editing terminal apparatus , for example. Consequently, the imaging apparatus  becomes able to quickly provide the converted metadata to that external device, for example.","Further, so as to convert the externally provided external metadata having an incompatible notation format into the internal metadata, the metadata input\/output processing block  associated with the second embodiment of the invention may also have the capability of the metadata input\/output processing block  associated with the first embodiment of the invention.","Namely, the metadata input\/output processing block  may be configured to have also the metadata notation format identification block  for identifying the notation format of external metadata. In addition, as with the case of the first embodiment for example, the conversion table selection block  may have the capability of selecting a conversion table corresponding to the notation format of external metadata identified by the metadata notation format identification block  from among a plurality of conversion tables for example stored in the conversion table database , for example. Moreover, as with the case of the first embodiment, the metadata notation format conversion block  may also have the capability of converting the notation format of external metadata into the notation format of internal metadata compatible with the metadata application processing block , for example. These novel configurations allow the conversion of the notation format of external metadata incompatible with the imaging apparatus  into the notation format of internal metadata, thereby letting the metadata application processing block  recognize and process the converted, compatible metadata.","The following describes the processing method for processing metadata in the imaging apparatus  associated with the second embodiment of the invention, with reference to .  is a flowchart indicative of the processing method of the imaging apparatus  associated with the second embodiment.","As shown in , in step S, metadata is generated in the imaging apparatus  (steps S; metadata generating process). The metadata generation block  of the imaging apparatus  newly generates metadata such as the above-mentioned take metadata, for example. The metadata generated in the imaging apparatus  is written in the internal metadata notation format compatible with the imaging apparatus .","It should be noted that the metadata generated in the imaging apparatus  includes not only the above-mentioned newly generated metadata but also the metadata externally provided and edited in the imaging apparatus . An example of the edited metadata is program metadata for example edited by additionally entering the above-mentioned take relating information for example by the metadata application processing block , for example.","Next, in step S, the notation format of metadata that is recognizable by the other party's external device to which the metadata is provided is identified (step S). The other party metadata notation format identification block  identifies the above-mentioned other party metadata format on the basis of the input done by the personnel or automatically, for example.","In step S, it is determined whether or not the identified other party metadata notation format is the same of the notation format of internal metadata in the imaging apparatus  (step S). The other party metadata notation format identification block  determines whether or not the known internal metadata notation format is the same as the other party metadata format identified in step S. If a mismatch is found, then the procedure goes to step S; if a match is found, the procedure goes to step S because there is no need for metadata conversion.","Then, in step S, the conversion table corresponding to the identified metadata notation format is selected (step S). The conversion table selection block  selects, for example, one conversion table corresponding to the other party metadata notation format identified in step S and the internal metadata notation format, from a plurality of conversion tables recorded in the conversion table DB .","Next, in step S, the notation format of the metadata generated as described above is converted on the basis of the above-mentioned selected conversion table (step S; metadata notation format conversion process). On the basis of the conversion table selected in step S, the metadata notation format conversion block  converts the internal metadata notation format into the other party metadata format. Consequently, the imaging apparatus  becomes able to convert the internal metadata notation format into the notation format that is recognizable by the editing terminal apparatus  for example.","In step S, the above-mentioned converted metadata and a video signal are recorded to a recording medium (step S; video signal recording process). In order for the editing terminal apparatus  for example to control the processing associated with the video signal on the basis of the above-mentioned metadata, the disk unit  relates the metadata converted in step S (or the metadata determined to be unnecessary for conversion in step S) with the video data corresponding thereto and records the related metadata and video data to the optical disk  for example.","Then, in step S, the metadata and so on are provided via the recording medium (step S). The imaging apparatus  provides the recording medium such as the optical disk  for example recorded with the metadata and the video data to an external device such as the editing terminal apparatus . Consequently, the editing terminal apparatus  for example becomes able to get the metadata converted so as to be compatible with the editing terminal apparatus  along with the video data.","Thus, the imaging apparatus  is capable of converting the notation format of the metadata generated and edited by itself into the other party notation format compatible with the editing terminal apparatus  for example and recording the converted metadata to a recording medium. Consequently, receiving this recording medium, the editing terminal apparatus  for example becomes able to read the converted metadata from the recording medium to recognize and process the metadata without executing a special processing operation. This novel configuration allows the editing terminal apparatus  that is the receiving side of metadata to have no metadata input\/output processing block  as described with reference to the first embodiment of the invention, resulting in a simplified device configuration and an accordingly reduced cost.","In addition, because video data and metadata are recorded to a recording medium as related with each other, the editing terminal apparatus  for example is capable of easily understanding the relationship between the acquired metadata and video data. Consequently, the editing terminal apparatus  is capable of suitably executing the processing associated with that video data on the basis of that metadata.","The following describes a third embodiment of the invention. The third embodiment of the invention is characterized in that an imaging apparatus  that is one embodiment of a video signal recording apparatus relates the metadata generated by itself with a conversion table and a video signal corresponding to that metadata and provides these metadata, conversion table, and video signals to an editing terminal apparatus  that is one embodiment of a video signal reproduction apparatus. Namely, in consideration of the editing terminal apparatus  that uses video signals and metadata, the imaging apparatus  that provides these video signals and metadata provides the conversion table corresponding to that metadata to the editing terminal apparatus  along with that metadata so as to allow the editing terminal apparatus  to easily convert that metadata for use.","The imaging apparatus  and the editing terminal apparatus  associated with the third embodiment of the invention are different from the imaging apparatus  and the editing terminal apparatus  associated with the first embodiment of the invention only in the functional configuration associated with the above-mentioned feature point. Therefore, the functional configurations other than that shown above, the system configuration, and the metadata associated with the imaging apparatus  and the editing terminal apparatus  of the third embodiment are substantially the same as those of the first embodiment, so that the description of these other configurations and metadata will be omitted.","First, with reference to , a configuration of the imaging apparatus  associated with the third embodiment of the invention will be described.  is a block diagram illustrating an approximate configuration of the imaging apparatus  associated with the third embodiment.","As shown in , the imaging apparatus  has a CPU , a memory block , an operator block , a display block , an audio output block , a communication block , an external interface , a camera block , a disk unit , a conversion table database , a metadata generation block , a metadata input\/output processing block , and a metadata application processing block .","It should be noted that the functional configurations of other component blocks of the imaging apparatus  associated with the third embodiment than the metadata input\/output processing block  are substantially the same as those of the imaging apparatus  associated with the first embodiment, so that the description of these other component blocks will be omitted.","The metadata input\/output processing block  is a feature block associated with the third embodiment and has a capability of selecting and outputting a conversion table necessary for the conversion of internal metadata, for example. The metadata input\/output processing block  has an other party metadata notation format identification block  and a conversion table selection block , for example.","The other party metadata notation format identification block  has a capability of identifying the notation format of metadata that can be handled by the other party's device (the editing terminal apparatus  for example) to which metadata is provided (hereafter also referred to as other party metadata format). The functional configuration of the other party metadata notation format identification block  is substantially the same as that of the other party metadata notation format identification block  associated with the second embodiment, so that the description thereof will be omitted. It should be noted that the other party metadata notation format identification block  such as above may not be arranged, for example.","The conversion table selection block  has a capability of selecting a conversion table corresponding to the metadata notation format compatible with an other party device such as the editing terminal apparatus  from among a plurality of conversion tables for example recorded to the conversion table database , for example. Namely, the conversion table selection block  is capable of selecting a conversion table for a device of other party to convert the notation format of internal metadata generated by the imaging apparatus  into the other party metadata format, for example. The conversion table selection processing such as above may be executed on the basis of the information about the other party metadata format entered from the other party metadata notation format identification block , for example. For example, if the other party metadata format identified by the other party metadata notation format identification block  is the MOS metadata format, the conversion table selection block  selects the conversion table corresponding to both internal metadata and MOS metadata for example.","If the metadata input\/output processing block  has no other party metadata notation format identification block , then the conversion table selection block  may select one or more conversion tables corresponding to the internal metadata generated by the imaging apparatus  and the external metadata having any given notation format. In this case, the conversion table selection block  may also select all conversion tables for example stored in the conversion table database  for example so as to be compatible as many types of external metadata as possible.","One or more conversion tables selected by the conversion table selection block  as described above are recorded to a recording medium such as the optical disk  by the disk unit . At the time of recording these conversion tables, the disk unit  configured as the video signal recording block associated with the third embodiment is capable of relating these conversion tables with the unconverted metadata generated by the metadata generation block  for example and the video data corresponding to that metadata, thereby recording the resultant related conversion tables, metadata, and video data to the recording medium. Techniques for relating and recording metadata and video data include one in which a directory configuration in the recording medium is used such that a conversion table file, a metadata file, and a video data file are recorded to a same folder or linked folders, another one in which a conversion table name and a video data file name are entered in metadata, and still another one in which a data file containing the information about the relation of these three files is recorded along with these files.","As described above, the recording medium such as the optical disk  recorded with unconverted metadata and a conversion table is provided to an external device such as the editing terminal apparatus . Consequently, the editing terminal apparatus  for example becomes able to get video data and the metadata associated with this video data and a conversion table for converting this metadata via the same recording medium, for example.","Thus the functional configurations of the component blocks of the imaging apparatus  have been described. However, the imaging apparatus  is not restricted to the above-mentioned exemplary configuration.","For example, by transmitting the above-mentioned unconverted metadata and conversion table corresponding thereto via the network , the imaging apparatus  may provide these metadata and conversion table to an external device such as the editing terminal apparatus . Consequently, the imaging apparatus  becomes able to quickly provide metadata and conversion tables to an external device concerned.","The metadata input\/output processing block  associated with the third embodiment of the invention may also have the same function as the metadata input\/output processing block  associated with the first embodiment so as to convert the externally inputted external metadata having an incompatible notation format into the internal metadata having a compatible notation format, for example.

The other party metadata notation format identification block  identifies the other party metadata format on the basis of the input done by the personnel or automatically, for example. It should be noted that this step may be skipped; in this case, subsequent steps S, S, and S will also be skipped.","Further, in step S, it is determined whether the identified other party metadata format is the same as the notation format of the internal metadata of the imaging apparatus  (step S). The other party metadata notation format identification block  determines whether the known notation format of internal metadata is the same as the other party metadata format identified in step S. If a mismatch is found, the procedure goes to step S. If a match is found, the procedure goes to step S because there is no need for transmitting the conversion table.","Then, in step S, one or more conversion tables are selected (step S; conversion table selection process). The conversion table selection block  selects one conversion table for example corresponding to both the other party metadata format identified in step S and the notation format of the internal metadata from among a plurality of conversion tables recorded to the conversion table database , for example.","If step S is skipped or the other party metadata format cannot be identified, the conversion table selection block  may select all or a part of a plurality of conversion tables recorded to the conversion table database , for example.","Next, in step S, the selected conversion table, the generated metadata, and the video signal are recorded to a recording medium (step S).

In this case, the disk unit  may also read only the metadata from that recording medium, for example. In this case, because the notation format of that metadata is compatible with the editing terminal apparatus , the metadata notation format conversion processing to be described later need not be executed. Therefore, the read metadata is directly outputted to the metadata application processing block  for processing.","The metadata input\/output processing block  is a feature block associated with the third embodiment of the invention and has a capability of converting external metadata into internal metadata and outputting the resultant internal metadata to the metadata application processing block , for example.

In this case, the metadata read in step S has a notation format compatible with the editing terminal apparatus . In this case, it is determined that the read metadata has a notation format compatible with the metadata application processing block  and therefore there is no need for executing conversion processing, upon which the procedure goes to step S. On the other hand, if the metadata read above has a notation format incompatible with the metadata application processing block , then no conversion table is attached. Therefore since the metadata application processing block  is incapable of recognizing and processing that metadata, all steps are ended.","On the other hand, in step S, metadata and a conversion table are read from the recording medium (step S; metadata reading process). If a conversion table is found recorded to the recording medium in step S, then the recording unit  reads metadata and one or more conversion table corresponding to the metadata from the recording medium and outputs the metadata and one or more conversion tables corresponding to the metadata to the metadata input\/output processing block .","In step S, it is determined whether any of the read conversion tables need not be selected (step S).

Thus, by recording plural types of conversion tables to a recording medium in advance allows this one recording medium to function as a metadata transmission medium corresponding to a plurality of editing terminal apparatuses  having recognizable different metadata notation formats, for example.","Also, because video data, metadata, and conversion tables are recorded to a recording medium in a related manner, the editing terminal apparatus  is capable of easily understanding the correlation between the acquired metadata, conversion tables, and video data. Consequently, the editing terminal apparatus  is capable of suitably executing the processing associated with that video data on the basis of the converted metadata.","The metadata generation block , the metadata input\/output processing blocks  and , and metadata application processing blocks  and  in the first through third embodiments may be configured each as a dedicated unit (or hardware device) if the above-mentioned processing functions can be realized or by installing an application program for executing the above-mentioned processing on the terminal apparatuses such as the imaging apparatus  and the editing terminal apparatus , for example.
