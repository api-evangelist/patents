title: Deployment of software applications on a cloud computing platform
abstract: In one aspect, a software application with application artifacts is deployed on a cloud computing platform. The cloud computing platform includes a platform product that can provide functionality that is required by the application. Application metadata is created based on analyzing the application artifacts and describes the application artifacts requirement. An application repository stores the application artifacts and the application metadata. A product description defines an application product for the software application and a product reference to the platform product is defined. The product description and the product reference are published in the application repository to update the application metadata. A composite repository refers to the application product and the platform product. The composite repository is transferred to a platform repository provided by the cloud computing platform.

{"@attributes":{"id":"description"},"BRFSUM":[{},{}],"heading":["BACKGROUND","DETAILED DESCRIPTION"],"p":["Software complexity is increasing resulting in changes to product cycles, requirements and modes of delivery of software applications. Customers' needs are being transformed to request flexibility in terms of processes, landscape and software components. Development of new software applications often relies on existing, previously developed functionality. Typically, software applications can adopt or get access to different services and capabilities from other software offerings. It is a common use case to adapt existing functionality to perform in a new environment. There are a number of scenarios for providing software components or entire applications for reuse by customers or end user. For example, software platforms can provide functionality that can be extended and therefore new applications can be built on top of them.","Cloud computing is the delivery of computing resources as a service over a network (e.g., the Internet). Software-as-a-Service (SaaS) is a type of a solution, where a cloud service provider allows software applications and various hardware and software resources on-demand when requested by an end user (e.g., customer).A customer of on-demand applications is free from the procurement and maintenance of the hardware and software needed for executing the applications. Platform-as-a-Service (PaaS) is another category of cloud computing solutions that provides the computing platform including operating system, programming language execution environment, database, and web server to facilitate the development and deployment of on-demand applications and services.","PaaS is a growing technology space offering possibilities for optimization of information technology (IT) spending. It provides facilities required to support the lifecycle of web applications and services, available from the Internet. Applications can run as a SaaS on the infrastructure that is provided from a PaaS provider. PaaS may give application developers the tools to design, develop, test, deploy and host their software applications, as well as use of application services and infrastructure. Typically, when an application is deployed on a given PaaS, it is expected to find it provisioned and ready to be installed and stared. Depending on the complexity of the solution, the provisioning process may involve a series of tedious tasks prone to errors.","Embodiments of techniques for deployment of software application on a cloud computing platform are described herein. In the following description, numerous specific details are set forth to provide a thorough understanding of embodiments of the invention. One skilled in the relevant art will recognize, however, that the invention can be practiced without one or more of the specific details, or with other methods, components, materials, etc. In other instances, well-known structures, materials, or operations are not shown or described in detail to avoid obscuring aspects of the invention.","Reference throughout this specification to \u201cone embodiment\u201d, \u201cthis embodiment\u201d and similar phrases, means that a particular feature, structure, or characteristic described in connection with the embodiment is included in at least one embodiment of the present invention. Thus, the appearances of these phrases in various places throughout this specification are not necessarily all referring to the same embodiment. Furthermore, the particular features, structures, or characteristics may be combined in any suitable manner in one or more embodiments.","In one embodiment, software applications can be developed based on available platforms or platform products to build new functionality as an extension to the existing functionality. For example, a platform can be provided by a third party, e.g. a cloud computing platform that allows provisioning of the software application in a cloud environment. A PaaS solution may provide an application runtime, user interface (UI) development toolkits, enterprise services, internal configuration, etc. that can be adopted and used in the development of the software application. In another embodiment, PaaS offerings may provide support in the lifecycle process of a given application in the process of deployment, installation and maintenance of fully-functional applications that are built and run on a given PaaS. A provisioning process can prepare the application containing software components (e.g., both application components and infrastructural components) together with the right configuration in the execution environment. In one embodiment, the infrastructural components can be software entities provided by the platform, e.g. platform services, core runtime, etc. In another embodiment, the PaaS solution may take care of uniting the provided platform's infrastructural components and separately developed application components for a given application. Thus, the application would be deployed and ready to be started.","Eclipse\u00ae development platform provides frameworks where plug-in extensions can be created. Software developers, including commercial vendors, can build, brand, and package products using the platform as a base technology. These products can be sold and supported commercially. Therefore, the efficient provisioning of the developed products is especially important. The Eclipse\u00ae development platform could be used to develop applications in various programming languages, such as, but not limited to, Java\u00ae, Perl\u00ae, C\u00ae, C++\u00ae, PHP\u00ae, etc. An Eclipse\u00ae-based product is a stand-alone program, e.g., self-contained and installable software application, built with the Eclipse\u00ae-based development platform. A product may optionally be packaged and delivered as one or more features. A feature may correspond to a particular functionality of the product or the application, and usually groups a number of unitary software components that could be managed together as a single entity. According to the terminology adopted in Eclipse\u00ae projects, such unitary software components are called plugins. The plugins are the basic installable and executable units or software code structures built by the Eclipse\u00ae developers.","By definition, products include all the code (e.g., plugins) needed to run the corresponding applications. For example, a product may include a newly developed Java\u00ae based application, a Java\u00ae Runtime Environment (JRE) and the Eclipse\u00ae platform code. The current Eclipse\u00ae provisioning platform (p2) requires that the plugins, the JRE, and the necessary Eclipse\u00ae platform code have to be packaged and installed together as a single product. In one embodiment, packaging different types of application plugins together can be substituted with references in the product definition to the necessary parts. In one embodiment, these parts can be defined also as products.","There are different technology solutions that may implement provisioning of applications in a cloud environment together with an existing platform product provided by an on-demand platform. For example, the Equinox p2 provisioning platform for Open Services Gateway initiative (OSGi\u00ae)-based applications. The p2 platform is part of the Equinox project of Eclipse\u00ae. The Equinox p2 provisioning platform includes a general-purpose provisioning infrastructure that can be used for provisioning a variety of applications.",{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0018","num":"0017"},"figref":"FIG. 1","b":["100","105","110","110","105","115","130","125","115","105","115","120","125","135","130","145","140","140"]},{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0019","num":"0018"},"figref":"FIG. 2","b":"200"},"In one embodiment, the software product may represent an application that requires additional functionality in order to be executed. Application artifacts  are developed for the software application. In one embodiment, the additional functionality can be provided from a cloud computing platform and thus the application can be started in a cloud environment. The application runs as a SaaS on top of the cloud computing platform. A deployment request  can be sent to an orchestrator  to deploy the application artifacts  on the cloud computing platform. In one embodiment, the orchestrator  can manage the lifecycle of developed and deployed software application on the cloud computing platform. In one embodiment, the orchestrator  can be a virtual machine (VM) that takes care to deploy, start, and stop the applications. In another embodiment, the orchestrator  can install the application on different VMs, where the application is accessed by end users. In one embodiment, the orchestrator  can automatically provision more than one VM to host one application. This is performed without the need of an additional interaction, for example, from a user.","The application artifacts  can be provided for deployment directly from an Integrated Development Environment (IDE) or from a customer's repository. In one embodiment, the customer's repository can be accessed from a network location, for example, on a specified uniform resource locator (URL). For example, Eclipse\u00ae provisioning mechanism p2 may be utilized to generate the customer's repository to be a p2 repository. The application artifacts  can be compiled and built. In one embodiment, the application artifacts  can be OSGi\u2122 bundles. In another embodiment, the application artifacts  may be included in one or more Java\u00ae ARchive (JAR or .jar) binary files, or one or more Web application ARchive (WAR) files. The different files may be stored in one or more folders. In one embodiment, the deployment request  can transfer the application artifacts to a deploy service  in the orchestrator . When the deploy service  receives the deployment request , the application artifacts  are analyzed to determine application artifacts requirements. In one embodiment, the metadata of the artifacts can be analyzed. Application metadata is created based on the analysis.","In one embodiment, the application artifacts may include metadata information that can be stored in a \u201cMETA-INF\u201d folder in a \u201cmanifest.mf\u201d file. The \u201cmanifest.mf\u201d file is part of a standard specification to which OSGi\u2122 adds additional metadata. Any non-OSGi\u2122 runtime will ignore the OSGi\u2122 metadata. OSGi\u2122 bundles can be used without restrictions in non-OSGi\u2122 Java\u00ae-based environment.","The deploy service  creates an application repository  and publishes application metadata  and application artifacts  in the application repository . In one embodiment, the application repository  can be published with the Equinox p2 Publisher. According to the Eclipse\u00ae terminology, the p2 Publisher provides means to add deployable entities into p2 repositories from a number of different sources. In another embodiment, the application metadata  describes the application requirements of the received application artifacts . For example, the requirements can be provided from an on-demand runtime platform, a cloud computing platform, or other PaaS offering. In another embodiment, part of the requirements can be provided from another software offering or more than one software offerings, which also have to be included in the deployment process on the cloud computing platform. The application artifacts  correspond to the application artifacts  received from the deployment request . In one embodiment, the application artifacts  can be converted versions of the application artifacts . For example, WAR files can be converted to Web application bundles (WABs), when the software application that is provisioned is an OSGi\u2122-based application.","In one embodiment, the application repository  can be a p2 repository created based on the p2 provisioning mechanism provided by Eclipse\u00ae. In one embodiment, the application metadata  can be p2 metadata that contains useful information about the elements that can be installed. The p2 provisioning process may generate metadata describing installable units (IUs). The application metadata  describes the different elements of a product to be installed. The format of the application metadata  can be, for example, a text file of certain format. In one embodiment, the application metadata  can also describe physical characteristics of the application artifacts . In addition, the application metadata describes requirements of the application artifacts  and their provided capabilities. In one embodiment, the requirements of the application artifacts  can be requirements for functionality that can be provided by already implemented enterprise services, runtime infrastructure, etc. These requirements can be provided by the cloud computing platform that is used for deploying the software product that is defined for the software application.","The below Table 1 shows parts of exemplary application metadata included in file \u201ccontent.xml\u201d, such as the application metadata  that is published in the p2 application repository after analyzing the received application artifacts for deployment. The application metadata  can include configuration information for the described IUs.",{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0026","num":"0025"},"tables":{"@attributes":{"id":"TABLE-US-00001","num":"00001"},"table":{"@attributes":{"frame":"none","colsep":"0","rowsep":"0","pgwide":"1"},"tgroup":[{"@attributes":{"align":"left","colsep":"0","rowsep":"0","cols":"1"},"colspec":{"@attributes":{"colname":"1","colwidth":"266pt","align":"center"}},"thead":{"row":[{"entry":"TABLE 1"},{"entry":{"@attributes":{"namest":"1","nameend":"1","align":"center","rowsep":"1"}}},{"entry":"content.xml"},{"entry":{"@attributes":{"namest":"1","nameend":"1","align":"center","rowsep":"1"}}}]},"tbody":{"@attributes":{"valign":"top"},"row":{"entry":{}}}},{"@attributes":{"align":"left","colsep":"0","rowsep":"0","cols":"1"},"colspec":{"@attributes":{"colname":"1","colwidth":"266pt","align":"left"}},"tbody":{"@attributes":{"valign":"top"},"row":[{"entry":"<?xml version=\u201c1.0\u201d encoding=\u201cUTF-8\u201d ?>"},{"entry":"\u2003\u2003<?metadataRepository version=\u20181.1.0\u2019?>"},{"entry":"\u2003\u2003\u2003\u2003\u2003\u2003\u2003\u2003\u2003\u2003\u2003\u2003\u2003\u2003\u2003\u2003. . . . . . . . . . . .
