title: High data rate wireless packet data communications system
abstract: A wireless packet data communications system that includes a number of modem pool transceivers (MPTs), one or more modem pool controllers (MPCs), and one or more servers. Each MPT receives and processes data packets to generate a modulated signal (e.g., a CDMA spread spectrum signal) suitable for transmission over a terrestrial communications link. Each MPC provides call related processing for one or more MPTs. The servers couple to the MPTs and MPCs via an Internet Protocol (IP) back-bone and provide management of the communications system. The IP back-bone further interconnects the MPTs with one or more data networks and includes a number of routers that route data packets between the data networks and the MPTs. Each MPT can couple to two or more routers for redundancy. Each MPT is operated as an element in an IP network and is associated with an IP address that identifies the MPT. One to three MPTs can be deployed at each cell site to provide wireless data service coverage for up to three sectors at the cell site. The MPCs can either be centralized and coupled to the MPTs via the IP back-bone or distributed about the communications system.

No. 60\/134,976, entitled \u201cHIGH DATA RATE (HDR) SYSTEM,\u201d filed May 20, 1999, which is also incorporated herein by reference in its entirety for all purposes.","I. Field of the Invention","The present invention relates to data communication. More particularly, the present invention relates to a novel and improved high data rate, wireless packet data communications system.","II. Description of the Related Art","The explosive growth of computer networks, such as the Internet, has spawned demands for high data rate infrastructures that can support the enormous amount of data traffic generated by these networks. Approximately concurrent with the growth of the Internet is the deployment and acceptance of wireless communications systems capable of supporting a variety of applications. However, earlier generations of wireless communications systems are generally designed for voice communication and are not efficient at transmitting data traffic generated by the Internet.","An example of such earlier generation wireless communications systems is a code division multiple access (CDMA) system disclosed in U.S. Pat. No. 4,901,307, issued Feb. 13, 1990 to Gilhousen et al., entitled \u201cSPREAD SPECTRUM MULTIPLE ACCESS COMMUNICATION SYSTEM USING SATELLITE OR TERRESTRIAL REPEATERS,\u201d and U.S. Pat. No. 5,103,459, issued Apr. 7, 1992 to Gilhousen et al., entitled \u201cSYSTEM AND METHOD FOR GENERATING WAVEFORMS IN A CDMA CELLULAR TELEPHONE SYSTEM,\u201d both assigned to the assignee of the present invention and incorporated herein by reference. These CDMA systems are typically designed to conform to the \u201cTIA\/EIA\/IS-95 Mobile Station-Base Station Compatibility Standard for Dual-Mode Wideband Spread Spectrum Cellular System,\u201d hereinafter referred to as the IS-95 standard.","An IS-95 compliant CDMA system is capable of supporting voice and data services over the forward and reverse communications links. Typically, each voice call or each data transmission is assigned a dedicated channel having a variable but limited data rate. In accordance with the IS-95 standard, traffic or voice data is partitioned into frames that are 20 msec in duration with data rates as high as 14.4 kbps. The frames are then transmitted over the assigned channel.","Although the IS-95 CDMA system is well suited for voice communication, it is inefficient for data communication, which is typically characterized by long periods of silence punctuated by large bursts of traffic. A newer generation wireless communications system designed to efficiently transmit data is disclosed in the aforementioned U.S. patent application Ser. No. 08\/963,386, now U.S. Pat. No. 6,574,211, issued Jun. 3, 2003 to Padovani et al. This system allows a large portion of the available resource to be used for data transmission to a particular user at any particular moment, thereby greatly increasing the peak data rate.","Given the ever-growing demand for wireless data communication, a high data rate, wireless packet data communications system capable of supporting data traffics, such as those related to the Internet, is highly desirable.","The present invention is a novel and improved high speed, wireless packet data communications system (also referred to as an HDR system) capable of providing wireless Internet services and other packet data services. The HDR system is based on a distributed architecture and includes elements that can be easily deployed and upgraded.","An embodiment of the invention provides a wireless packet data communications system that includes a number of Modem Pool Transceivers (MPTs), one or more Modem Pool Controllers (MPCs), and one or more servers. Each MPT receives and processes data packets to generate a modulated signal (e.g., a CDMA spread spectrum signal) suitable for transmission over a terrestrial communications link. Each MPC provides call related processing for one or more MPTs. The servers couple to the MPTs and MPCs via an Internet Protocol (IP) back-bone and provide management of the communications system. The IP back-bone further interconnects the MPTs with one or more data networks and includes a number of routers that route data packets between the data networks and the MPTs. Each MPT can couple to two or more routers for redundancy.","Each MPT is operated as an element in an IP network and is associated with an IP address that identifies the MPT. To provide a high peak data rate, each MPT can be operated to transmit to one access terminal at any given moment. One to three MPTs can be deployed at each cell site to provide wireless data service coverage for up to three sectors at the cell site. The MPTs are deployable in similar manner as base station transceivers in an existing CDMA system (e.g., IS-95 system). The MPTs can be operated to provide handoff of access terminals to support roaming (i.e., an access terminal can handoff to another MPT having an improved communications path).","The MPCs can either be centralized and coupled to the MPTs via the IP back-bone or distributed about the communications system. Each MPC maintains a protocol stack for each session between an access terminal and the MPTs being controlled by the MPC. The protocol stack identifies the communications parameters for the session and the protocol stack for an inactive (e.g., dormant) access terminal can be stored in a memory.","The servers may include, for example, (1) a RADIUS server that provides authentication, authorization, and accounting functions, (2) an OAM&P server that provides configuration and management functions, (3) a DHCP server that dynamically assigns IP addresses for the access terminals, and (4) an account server that stores user profile information.","The communications system can be operative to provide, for example, wireless Internet services and is capable of achieving a high peak data rate (e.g., at least 2.4 Mbps). The communications system can be deployed as a stand-alone data network, as a data network that is complementary to an existing wireless telephony network (e.g., a CDMA network), or integrated within the CDMA network.","Another embodiment of the invention provides an access terminal for use in a wireless packet data communications system. The access terminal includes an RF module, a modem block, a processor core, and (typically) an interface unit. The RF module receives a modulated signal transmitted over a wireless communications link and conditions the received signal to generate a conditioned signal. The modem block demodulates the conditioned signal to generate data, and the processor core receives and processes the data into packets suitable for transmission to a receiving device. The interface unit provides, for example, an Ethernet or serial interface to the receiving device. The access terminal is operated as an element in an IP network and is associated with an IP address that identifies the access terminal. The access terminal can be assigned a unique identifier and password used to authenticate the access terminal to the communications system. The access terminal can be operated to receive data at a high peak data rate (e.g., at least 2.4 Mbps).","Yet another embodiment of the invention provides a method for providing wireless packet data services in a communications system. In accordance with the method, a session is first initiated between an access terminal and the communications system. A request is then received for a data transmission from the communications system. In response, the requested data is retrieved from a data network and the retrieved data is processed and modulated to generate a modulated signal (e.g., a CDMA spread spectrum signal) suitable for transmission over a terrestrial communications link. The modulated signal is then transmitted to the access terminal. The access terminal is operated as an element in an IP network and is associated with an IP address that identifies the access terminal.","Typically, the access terminal is activated and configured prior to initiating a communications session. The activation and configuration typically include assigning a unique identifier and password to the access terminal to be used for each session. During session initiation, the access terminal can be authenticated via a secure message exchange using, for example, a Challenge Handshake Authentication Protocol (CHAP). The access terminal can also be assigned a static or dynamic IP address to be used for the session.","Other aspects and embodiments of the invention are described in further detail below.","HDR System",{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0044","num":"0043"},"figref":["FIG. 1","FIG. 1"],"b":["100","100","100","110","110","112"]},"Each access terminal  communicates with one or more access points  over a wireless link. Each access point  couples to one or more routers  via high-speed communications links (e.g., T1\/E1, Ethernet, or others). Each router  directs traffics among the access points  and other network elements and networks coupled to it, such as the Internet. To provide redundancy and improved reliability, each access point  may be coupled to two or more routers , and each router  may couple in parallel with another router. Routers  further couple to an Internet Protocol (IP) network  that further couples to a Local Area Network (LAN) . LAN  includes various servers  that support the operation of HDR system  and is described in further detail below. A Packet Data Serving Node (PDSN)  couples to LAN  and to the Internet and performs various functions to support packet data service.","Access terminal  includes a radio modem and a data interface allowing a user to access a packet data network (e.g., PDSN ) through a radio network (e.g., the HDR system). Access terminal  can be implemented in various physical embodiments such as, for example, a modem, a phone, a module, or some other units. The data interface may allow access terminal  to interface with other devices (e.g., a computer, an appliance, Personal Digital Assistance (PDAs), set-top boxes, printers, and so on) via a wireless or wireline link and using various layers, as described below. In the specific example shown in , access terminal A interfaces with a computer A via a wireline link and with a computer B and a telephone C via wireless links.","In an embodiment, access points  support the air-link with access terminals  and provide built-in routing function that can be used to provide IP services. Each access point  appears to the rest of the IP network as a modem pool and a Network Access Point (NAP) with an integrated router. As shown in , multiple access points  can couple to each router  and each access point  can couple to two (or more or fewer) routers  via high-speed links. Routers  form the IP back-bone of HDR system .","Each access point  supports data transmission to a number of access terminals . Each access point  also performs some of the functions typically associated with conventional Base Station Transceiver (BTS), Base Station Controller (BSC), and Mobile Switching Center (MSC), as described below. For a particular session, access terminal  communicates with one or more access points .","The air-link between access terminals  and access points  can be achieved based on various technologies (e.g., CDMA, TDMA, and so on) and using various designs. In an embodiment, the air-link is implemented based on the HDR design described in the aforementioned U.S. patent application Ser. No. 08\/963,386, now U.S. Pat. No. 6,574,211, which is especially suited for packet data transmission. The HDR air-link is designed to be flexible so that multiple architectural options can be supported. For example, sufficient signaling is provided in the HDR air-link such that options ranging from highly integrated architectures to distributed architectures can be supported, as described below.","High-speed communication can be maintained between access points , routers , IP network , and LAN . For example, access points  can couple to routers  via T1\/E1, Ethernet, or some other high-speed links. Routers  and LAN  can each couple to IP network  and the Internet via Ethernet or some other link. Other communications links can also be used to interconnect the elements within the HDR system and are within the scope of the invention.","In the embodiment shown in , LAN  includes a Remote Authentication Dial-In User Service (RADIUS) server A, a Domain Name System (DNS) server B, a Dynamic Host Configuration Protocol (DHCP) server C, an Operating Administration, Maintenance, and Provisioning (OAM&P) server D, and an account server E. RADIUS server A, DNS server B, DHCP server C, and OAM&P server D can be implemented with off-the-shelf servers that perform the functions normally associated with these servers. A brief description of the functions performed by servers A through E is described below.","RADIUS server A performs Authentication, Authorization, And Accounting (AAA) functions. The PDSN communicates with RADIUS server A to authenticate and authorize an access terminal  and to receive accounting information. RADIUS server A also stores profile information and accounting information for users on the HDR system. The accounting information may include, for example, (1) the identity of the network, (2) the identity of the user, the location of the access terminal  (e.g., to the resolution of an access point  or sector), (3) the start\/end time of the communication at that location, (4) the number of octets sent\/received at that location, (5) the number of packets sent\/received at that location, and others. Records are sent from the access points  to RADIUS server A periodically.","Various accounting mechanisms can be used for the HDR system since it is not dependent on any particular accounting mechanism. For example, the accounting mechanism used to support telephony networks can be adopted to support the HDR system. The RADIUS accounting can also be used and is described in further detail in Internet Engineering Task Force (IETF's) Request for Comment (RFC) 2139, entitled \u201cRADIUS ACCOUNTING,\u201d by C. Rigney, Apr. 1997.","DNS server B translates domain names into IP addresses. When a host needs a domain name resolution, DNS server B sends out a DNS query to try to resolve the domain name. DNS server B may be configured to exchange information with other DNS servers in the IP network.","DHCP server C assigns IP addresses to access terminals , if and as they are needed. The PDSN communicates with DHCP server C and requests IP addresses as necessary.","OAM&P server D can be used for configuration and management of the HDR system. Various management mechanisms can be used for the HDR system since it is not dependent on any particular network management mechanism. For example, the systems currently available to support telephony networks can be adopted to support the HDR system.","In an embodiment, a standard Simple Network Management Protocol (SNMP) interface is used as the network management mechanism for the HDR system. The functions performed by OAM&P server D via the SNMP interface may include, for example, (1) configuration management, (2) performance management, (3) fault management, and others. The access points  can be configured and monitored using off-the-shelf SNMP-based software executed on OAM&P server D.","In an embodiment, the access points  and other elements (e.g., routers , servers , and so on) in the HDR system are each provided with a SNMP Management Information Base (MIB) that supports the framework for SNMP information gathering and storage. The SNMP MIB is designed to fit with off-the-shelf network management systems. Elements fitted with SNMP MIBs are able to communicate statistics and status information to a network manager. The network manager is able to request management information from managed nodes and is able to make changes in the way these nodes handle network traffic. OAM&P server D can thus be used to configure and monitor the access points  in the HDR system.","Account server E is used to store information for users on the HDR system (e.g., confidential information, credit card information).","HDR Architectures","The HDR system may be deployed as an HDR radio network (or simply, an HDR network) that provides services to a particular geographic area. In an embodiment, the HDR network may be implemented with a collection of MPCs and MPTs interconnected by an IP network. This architecture provides a location independent, logical separation of radio network functions. This architecture also translates into flexibility in the implementation of the HDR network since network functions can be placed in different network elements depending on the particular implementation.","In an embodiment, an MPT provides functionality analogous to that of a BTS in an IS-41 network. Each MPT can provide service to one or more MPCs and terminates the radio link in an HDR sector associated with the MPT. The MPT performs physical channel modulation\/demodulation and also provides Medium Access Control (MAC) functions such as, for example, forward link scheduling and reverse link closed loop power control. The MPT further generates and transmits control channel messages. The IS-41 standard is incorporated herein by reference.","In an embodiment, an MPC provides functionality analogous to that of a BSC and a Visitor Location Register (VLR) in an IS-41 network. Each MPC can receive service from one or more MPTs. The MPC terminates the Radio Link Protocol (RLP) that contains user traffic, controls the air-link connection for each of the connected users as they move throughout the network, transports access terminal  specific messages, and provides MAC functions such as, for example, reverse link outer loop power control synchronization.","The MPC performs many of the functions typically performed by a conventional base station controller for a session such as, for example, session control, connection control, and selection functions. In an embodiment, the MPC further maintains a protocol stack for each session, as described below. In an embodiment, for a particular session between an access terminal  and the HDR network, only one MPC has control of the session at any particular moment. An access point  that includes this MPC is referred to as an \u201canchor\u201d access point .","Network interfaces are used to securely connect a network element (e.g., an MPC, an MPT, and so on) to the IP network and provide different transport options. The network interfaces can be implemented to provide IP network Interior Gateway Protocols (IGPs) such as, for example, Routing Information Protocol (RIP), Open Shortest Path First (OSPF) protocol, and so on. The network interface can further be implemented to provide IP security protocols such as, for example, IP Security (IPSec).",{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0065","num":"0064"},"figref":"FIG. 2","b":["200","124","126","124","126"]},"An access terminal  establishes communication with a particular MPT  via an HDR air-link. MPT  is controlled by, and communicates with, an MPC  assigned for the communication. MPC  further communicates with other elements in the IP network (such as a service network) to provide the requested service.","Various functional interfaces can be provided for the MPCs, some examples of which are described below:\n\n","Similarly, various functional interfaces can be provided for the MPTs, some examples of which are described below:\n\n","The HDR network can be implemented using various architectures. For example, the MPC functionality can be centralized and coupled to the MPTs via the IP network. Alternatively, the MPC functionality can be distributed among the MPTs. Some of these architectures are described below. Other architectures are possible and are within the scope of the invention.",{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0070","num":"0078"},"figref":"FIG. 3A","b":["300","300","320","124","142","130","320","124","142","300","124","142"]},{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0071","num":"0079"},"figref":"FIG. 3B","b":["320","320","126","128","126","320","128","126"]},{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0072","num":"0080"},"figref":"FIG. 4A","b":["400","400","420","142","130","420","142","400","142"]},{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0073","num":"0081"},"figref":["FIG. 4B","FIG. 4B"],"b":["420","420","126","124","128","124","126","128"]},"The elements of the HDR network can be implemented in various embodiments depending on the particular HDR architecture employed. For example, one or more MPTs and zero or more MPCs can be integrated into a hardware platform referred to above as an access point . Similar to a conventional wireless network in which the BTS function is local at the cell site, the access point  can be designed to provide the MPT function at the cell site. However, the controller function in the HDR network may be centralized at one location (for a distributed MPT architecture) similar to a conventional wireless network, or distributed at the cell site (for a distributed MPC architecture).","For each session between the access terminal  and the HDR system, the access point  that performs the MPC functions for the access terminal  is designated as the \u201canchor\u201d access point  for that access terminal 's session.","The access points  in the distributed MPT and distributed MPC architectures can be physically implemented in various manners. For example, the access point  can be implemented as a channel card that can be used to upgrade a multi-carrier BTS to implement the HDR system. The access point  can also be implemented as a packaged hardware box that can be deployed using the cell site, tower, and antennas of a pre-existing wireless system or using its own cell site, tower, and antennas. Various other implementations can also be contemplated and are within the scope of the invention.","The HDR system is thus based on a distributed (i.e., decentralized) architecture that allows the system to be scaled with demands. For example, additional access points  can be installed to provide coverage to a new geographic area or to increase system throughput. Also, the access points  can be upgraded or replaced with minimal disruption in service to the rest of the HDR system.","Access Network","The HDR system may be deployed in various manners. For example, the HDR system may be (1) deployed as a stand-alone data network, (2) deployed as a data network complementary to an existing wireless telephony network (e.g., a CDMA network), or (3) integrated into a CDMA system deployment. The stand-alone and complementary HDR system can be implemented with independently packaged access points . The integrated system can be implemented, for example, with HDR channel cards used to upgrade a multi-carrier BTS. As used herein, a CDMA system\/network that is complementary to the HDR system\/network can be any wireless system\/network that conforms to any standards (e.g., an IS-95 standard, a CDMA-2000 standard, or some other standards), or is implemented based on other designs.",{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0079","num":"0087"},"figref":"FIG. 5","b":["500","510","520","530","540"]},"Radio networks  and  provide the radio access for the access terminals  within these networks. PDSN  provides packet data service to the access terminals  and performs conventional network access point functionality such as, for example, the Point-to-Point Protocol (PPP), the RADIUS protocol, and the mobile IP protocol.","As shown in , each radio network interfaces to a service network using one or more of the interfaces defined in the \u201cInter-operability Specification for CDMA Access Network Interfaces,\u201d which is incorporated herein by reference. For packet data services, the interfaces are the Packet Control Function (PCF) node to PDSN traffic interface (A10) and the PCF to PDSN signaling interface (A11). For IS-41 and Public Switched Telephone Network (PSTN) services, the interfaces are the BSC to MSC signaling interface (A1) and the BSC to MSC Pulse Code Modulation (PCM) traffic interface (A2).","For enhanced compatibility and flexibility, the functionality of HDR radio network  is designed to map to the functionality of a radio network in a CDMA wireless IP network. This allows HDR radio network  to be easily integrated with CDMA systems and to connect to the same PDSN . Although HDR radio network  can conform to the same model as CDMA radio network , there are no dependencies between these radio networks. HDR radio network  can thus be deployed independently from, in conjunction with, or integrated with CDMA radio network .","HDR radio network  can also be deployed in conjunction with other wireless radio networks such as, for example, GSM, TDMA, and others.","As noted above, various HDR architectures are provided by the invention including the distributed MPT and distributed MPC architectures described in , respectively. Moreover, the HDR system can be deployed as a stand-alone data network, a data network complementary to an existing CDMA network (e.g., an IS-95 network, a CDMA2000 network, or some other radio networks), or integrated into the CDMA network. The functionality and services provided by the HDR system may also be combined with those of another system such that one access terminal  can be used to obtain voice, data, and other services. In an embodiment, the RF characteristics of the HDR system are designed to be similar to those of CDMA systems. This allows the HDR and CDMA systems to share cell sites, towers, antennas, and other system elements.","Various deployments of the HDR system using various architectures are thus possible. Some of these deployments are described below.",{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0086","num":"0094"},"figref":["FIG. 6A","FIG. 1","FIG. 6A"],"b":["600","120","150","150","134","142","142"]},"The CDMA system includes a number of BTS  coupled to a number of BSC  (only one of each is shown in  for simplicity).

BSC  can further couple to PDSN  via R-P.","As shown in , access points  in the HDR system can be packaged in separate units that can be co-located with existing BTSs . This deployment offers flexibility in allowing the service providers to deploy HDR equipment from manufacturers that may not be the same as their phone network equipment providers. This is possible since the HDR equipment need not be the same as the BTS hardware.","A dual mode access terminal  can be used to receive service from either the CDMA system or the HDR system, or both (and possibly concurrently).

Voice service can be provided by the CDMA system. Data service can be provided by the HDR system, or by the CDMA system at lower data rates in areas where HDR has not yet been deployed. Applications that require simultaneous voice and data can also be accommodated, and handoffs between CDMA and HDR are also possible.","IP Backbone",{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0094","num":"0102"},"figref":"FIG. 7","b":["120","120","120","120"]},"The HDR system is highly available to the users due to its decentralized architecture.

Furthermore, the use of OSPF from the access points  over the backhauls allows alternate links to accommodate the backhaul traffic if one or more backhaul links are out of service. The OSPF protocol is also capable of balancing the traffic load on multiple backhaul links between the access points  and routers (since they are considered equivalent routes) and is further capable of supporting automatic fail-over. The access points  and routers also provide high availability options through the use of hardware redundancy and data mirroring.","Tunneling and Virtual Private Networks","The HDR system can be designed to support a Virtual Private Network (VPN) via \u201cuser initiated\u201d and \u201ccompulsory\u201d tunneling mechanisms that run over IP. VPN uses secure tunneling protocols (i.e., strong encryption and authentication) to provide a secure private channel across a public network such as the Internet. Secure VPN services can be provided, for example, by use of the IPSec protocol.","User initiated tunnels are transparent to the HDR system. Thus, the RADIUS server and access points  behave the same way whether the user connects directly to the HDR system or initiates a tunnel to another network.","Compulsory tunnels are not initiated by the user but are directed by the HDR system. For example, compulsory tunnels may be used to cause the user's traffic to be directed to an Internet Service Provider (e.g., a corporate network) that is different than the service provider for the HDR system.",{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0099","num":"0107"},"figref":"FIG. 8","b":["112","120","120","142","130","142","142","142","152","152","120"]},"Layers","In an embodiment, the HDR system uses the Internet Protocol (IP) as a transport and supports network applications and protocols that are compatible with IP.

Modifications to the HDR physical layer, or other air-links, may also be used and are within the scope of the invention.","In an embodiment, a Radio Link Protocol (RLP) layer is provided as an additional layer on top of the HDR physical layer to provide error detection and error correction for the wireless link. The RLP layer is designed to reduce the air-link frame error rate to a level where higher layer protocols can operate effectively. The RLP layer attempts to achieve a frame error rate in the order of 10. The RLP layer receives data that is to be sent over the air, puts the data in a byte stream for over-the-air transmission, and subsequently puts back the received bytes in the appropriate order after the transmission. The RLP layer keeps track of the byte stream and is able to retransmit missing or erroneous bytes over the air. The RLP layer is unaware of any framing that is done in the layers above it.","In an embodiment, the data link layer employs the Point-to-Point Protocol (PPP) to carry IP. The PPP and the layers above it are not aware that they are utilizing a wireless physical layer and behave in the same manner as for a wire-line data session. During the PPP link set-up, connection parameters and Van Jacobson TCP\/IP header compression are negotiated and an IP address is allocated. PPP also employs a Cycle Redundancy Check (CRC) to identify errors in transmission.","In an embodiment, the network layer utilizes the well-known Internet Protocol (IP) as a transport mechanism. With this connectionless protocol, each IP packet travels independently until it arrives at the host (e.g., the user's computer or the server being accessed). IP packets may arrive out of sequence and are put back together at the host by the higher layers. To simplify the design of the HDR system and provide enhanced compatibility and connectivity with existing networks, the access points  and other elements in the back-bone of the HDR system communicate via IP. The access points  and back-bone elements (e.g., routers, servers, and so on) are assigned static IP addresses. The access terminals  may use static IP addresses or may be assigned dynamic IP addresses at the start of the sessions.","In an embodiment, the transport layer utilizes the Transmission Control Protocol (TCP), the User Datagram Protocol (UDP), some other protocol, or a combination thereof. UDP is a transport protocol that does not provide reliability mechanisms and is typically used when reliability is not required. A UDP datagram consists of a single message that either requests a piece of information or replies to a request. TCP is a reliable transport that keeps track of communication between two hosts (e.g., the user's computer and the server being accessed). Each TCP connection is uniquely identified by the combination of the two pairs of IP address and TCP port numbers (two TCP sockets). TCP also provides error detection and error recovery mechanisms.","Applications","For enhanced flexibility, the HDR system is designed to support numerous mainstream applications that are based on, for example, TCP\/IP or UDP\/IP. These applications include, for example, web browser application, electronic mail application, and others. Generally, communications protocols are established during session initiation. These protocols are then used to support various applications that may be executed by the user on the client. A protocol stack identifies various layers established for a particular session and the particular protocol employed at those layers. The protocol stacks for some example applications are described below for a better understanding.",{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0111","num":"0119"},"figref":"FIG. 10A","b":["142","130","142","130","112","142","10"]},"The protocol stack shown in  represents a specific implementation. The client and web servers execute web applications that run over TCP, IP, and Ethernet. The communication from the client to the web servers is achieved via IP. The air-link between the access terminal  and access point  is achieved using PPP, RLP, and the HDR air-link. Other protocols can also be used to facilitate communication between the hosts and are within the scope of the invention. For example, at the data link layer, Ethernet may be replaced with another protocol (e.g., USB, serial, and so on).","For web browsing application, the information contained in the documents can be transmitted across the Internet using, for example, the HyperText Transport Protocol (HTTP). A variety of end-to-end security protocols can be used to provide a secured web browsing session. For example, Secure Socket Layer (SSL) protocol can be used to provide a secure channel between the two hosts (i.e., the user's computer and the server being accessed). Secure HTTP protocol can also be used to provide security for web documents using the web browser application.",{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0114","num":"0122"},"figref":"FIG. 10B","b":["142","130","142","130","112","142","10"]},"Similar to , the protocol stack shown in  represents a specific implementation.

The communication from the client to the mail servers is achieved via IP, and the air-link between the access terminal  and access point  is achieved using PPP, RLP, and HDR air-link. Other protocols can also be used and are within the scope of the invention.","E-mail can be supported through use of various protocols such as, for example, the Simple Mail Transfer Protocol (SMTP), the Post Office Protocol version 3 (POP3), the Internet Message Access Protocol (IMAP), and others. The user runs an e-mail application (i.e., user agent) on the client, which communicates with the mail servers (i.e., message transfer agents) periodically to send e-mail messages or to check whether new messages have arrived.","Authentication, Encryption, and Data Reliability","The HDR system supports several mechanisms to provide a secure service. These mechanisms include, for example, (1) authentication and authorization of the users by the RADIUS server at session initiation, (2) authentication and encryption of frames sent over the reverse link from the access terminals  to the access points , (3) authentication (and possibly encryption) of management messaging information sent over the HDR system backhauls using the IPSec protocol, (4) prevention of malicious user traffics by fire walls installed on each access point , and possibly other mechanisms. Security features are provided to protect against theft of service and loss of user identity. User data can be protected, for example, by various mechanisms provided at higher layer protocols.","In an embodiment, strong authentication mechanisms are provided at the air-link layer to prevent and deter theft-of-service attacks. In a specific implementation, the access terminal  sends an authentication code with each reverse link packet sent to the access point . The access point  then authenticates each packet received from the access terminal . The authentication codes can be generated using various secure algorithms such as, for example, the SHA-1 hash algorithm or some other algorithm known in the art.","In an embodiment, the HDR system is designed to provide strong encryption mechanisms at the air-link layer that prevent, among other things, the user's identity from being sent over-the-air in the clear. In a specific implementation, the access terminal  encrypts each reverse link packet to prevent eavesdroppers from discovering the user's identity. Various encryption algorithms can be used to encrypt packets and to generate the stream cipher used for encryption. For example, the access terminal  can use the SOBER stream cipher for encryption.",{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0120","num":"0128"},"figref":"FIG. 11A","b":["110","120","110","120"]},"End-to-end security at higher layers can be used to provide a secure communication. Generally, the two communicating hosts (i.e., the client and the server being accessed) cooperate to provide end-to-end security of the user data using one or more security protocols. Any security protocol that is compatible with IP can be used. For example, an application layer security protocol such as Secure Socket Layer (SSL) that is supported by many secure web sites and available on many web browsers can be used for secure web transactions. A network layer security protocol such as Point-to-Point Tunneling Protocol (PPTP) of IPSec (for Virtual Private Networks) can also be used.

In an embodiment, the HDR system utilizes three levels of error detection and correction at the RLP, PPP, and TCP layers. In general, data applications are not as sensitive to delays as voice applications. This allows the HDR system to provide various mechanisms for error detection and data retransmission. The combination of these mechanisms at the RLP, PPP, and TCP layers can provide a low packet error rate comparable to those of conventional wire-line data systems.","The HDR system utilizes the RLP layer to reduce the effective air-link frame error rate to a level (e.g., in the order of 10) where higher layer protocols can operate efficiently. This is described above with reference to . The RLP mechanism uses a Negative Acknowledged (NAK)-based scheme to signal frames received in error, thereby reducing the amount of signaling. In an embodiment, the HDR system employs an enhanced RLP mechanism that sequences octets instead of frames. This enhanced RLP mechanism results in a more efficient retransmission mechanism and can effectively handle complex issues relating to segmentation and re-assembly when a retransmitted frame cannot fit into the payload available at the time of retransmission.","The PPP layer utilizes a Cyclic Redundancy Check (CRC) to provide additional error detection capability. The TCP also offers a significant amount of error detection and correction at the two end points and is a reliable transport mechanism.","Operating States","The access terminals  and access points  allow the HDR system of the invention to provide various wireless packet data services such as, for example, web browsing, electronics mail, and many others.

The account server may also assign and provide to the access terminal  other pertinent information such as, for example, the user's e-mail address, the user's mail server, the news server, the web proxy server, and others.

In an embodiment, confidential information is stored in the account server and may include, for example, the user's credit card number, billing address, and others.","Session Establishment","Once the access terminal  has been activated and configured, a session can be established to access the HDR system. In an embodiment, for ease of use and to provide a seamless user interface, a new session is automatically initiated by the access terminal  whenever it detects that a connection needs to be established. For example, a user may activate a web browser application on the user's computer and start browsing. When the URL of a web site is entered (e.g., www.qualcomm.com), the web browser application attempts to access the appropriate HDR system resources. The access terminal  then initiates a new session with the HDR system. In this manner, the start of the new session and connection requires no action from the user and becomes transparent to the user. The unique identifier and password assigned to the access terminal  are used by the HDR system for identification and authentication functions.","The HDR system is designed to provide a fast connection time. This allows the user's \u201cnatural state\u201d to be dormancy when radio resources are not being used. The fast and transparent connection supported by the HDR system results in a convenient and highly desirable \u201calways-on\u201d user experience. If the user needs to start a new session, the access terminal  automatically starts the new session and connection with the HDR system. The user does not need to dial-in or enter user's unique identifier and password to establish the new session. If the user has already established a session and is dormant, the user can come out of the dormant state by simply sending or receiving information.","In an embodiment, each time a new session is established, the user is authenticated using the unique identity and password that are configured into the access terminal  during the service activation process.

In an embodiment, the PDSN performs the following tasks in a mobile IP session:\n\n","When an access terminal  moves from one PDSN to another during an active packet data session, a new PPP session is established. Mobile IP provides IP layer mobility management function that maintains communications across PDSNs. In order to maintain IP connectivity, the access terminal  initiates a PDSN to PDSN handoff by registering with its home agent, as specified in RFC 2002.

Such operating modes can include, for example, an active move, a dormant mode, and a suspended mode. Other operating modes or additional modes can also be supported and are within the scope of the invention.","Each of the supported operating modes represents a particular operating state of the access terminal . In an embodiment, the dormant mode refers to the period of time when an access terminal  and a radio network have an open session, do not have an open connection, and wherein the access terminal  operates in slotted mode. In slotted mode, the access terminal  only listens to the control channel during its slot and stays asleep the rest of the time to conserve battery power. In an embodiment, the suspended mode refers to the period of time when an access terminal  and a radio network have an open session, do not have an open connection, and wherein the access terminal  does not operate in a slotted mode. The suspended mode is similar to the dormant mode, except that a suspended access terminal  can wake up more quickly than a dormant access terminal  when activity is initiated by the network. The faster wake up time is possible because the access terminal  is not operated in slotted mode.","The dormant and suspended modes allow the HDR system to efficiently utilize the available air-link resources. These modes are entered by the access terminal  during periods of no activity. The dormant and suspended modes allow the HDR system to maintain the logical state of the user's session while releasing the resources associated with the air-link. The logical state may be identified by, for example, the PPP and higher layers as well as the radio link session information. The user's session can be kept alive, for example, based on the system's recognition of the air-link location update of the access terminal .","The dormant and suspended modes are well suited for the bursty nature of packet data services. During idle periods (e.g., when the user is composing an e-mail message), valuable air-link connection resources are not unnecessarily tied up and can be used by other users in the system. These modes effectively increase the number of subscribers that can be accommodated by the HDR system.","In an embodiment, a user enters the dormant or suspended mode based on his activity (or lack of activity), which can be measured by various techniques. For example, inactivity can be measured by a set of idle timers. One idle timer can be maintained by the user in the access terminal  and another timer can be maintained by the service provider at the network level. The smaller of these two timers can cause the user to enter the dormant mode.",{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0159","num":"0177"},"figref":["FIG. 16","FIG. 16"],"b":["110","110"]},"In a specific implementation, to provide a seamless experience, a user can automatically come out of the dormant mode as the user starts sending or receiving data over the air. Since the user's session state information is maintained by the MPC during the dormancy, a connection can be re-established quickly (e.g., less than 0.5 second) and the user can quickly resume activity. The ability to store session state information and quickly re-establish a connection allows the dormant mode to be the \u201cnatural state\u201d of users in the HDR system. Protocol stack is saved for the suspended mode in similar manner as for the dormant mode.","Push Services","The HDR system can be operated to provide \u201cpush services\u201d to users that have become dormant or suspended. The push services may include, for example, information requested by the user (e.g., stock quotes, sport scores, news headlines, weather information, and so on) or information disseminated by the service provider (e.g., advertisement, announcements, and so on).

For example, a portable access terminal  may move its point of attachment for a new session or during dormancy. Pedestrian applications can be considered as portable in nature since they slowly move their point of attachment and the access terminal  can transparently be put in dormant mode while the change in attachment occurs. And finally, a mobile access terminal  moves its point of attachment while it has an active connection with the HDR system.","The HDR system allows a user to move among access points  and from one subnet to the next.

As the access terminal  moves about the HDR coverage area, the two systems can initiate seamless handoff on both the air-link and network sides. The dual-mode access terminal  can be used to provide mobile IP.","On the air-link side, the access point  can signal to the access terminal  when it is near the edge of the coverage area and that the neighboring cells are CDMA cells. This then causes a dual-mode access terminal  to search for both HDR system access point  and CDMA base station (e.g., search for both HDR pilots and CDMA pilots). If a CDMA pilot is detected, the air link may be handed from the HDR system to the CDMA system, for example, in a manner similar to the handoff between IS-95 and AMP systems.

The dual-mode unit can share some of the circuitry such as the RF components and ASICs. Numerous implementations of access terminal  are possible and are within the scope of the invention.","Access Point","Various embodiments of access point  can be designed and are within the scope of the invention. For example,  shows a simplified block diagram of the access point  for a distributed MPT architecture and  shows a simplified block diagram of the access point  for a distributed MPC architecture. In these designs, the access point  includes one or more MPTs  (three MPTs  are shown in ) coupled to a network interface . In the distributed MPC architecture, the access terminal  further includes an MPC  that couples to MPTs  and network interface .","Each MPT  performs data processing and supports a single sector. In the forward path, MPT  receives IP packets from the backhaul link via network interface , processes the IP packets to generate baseband signal, and modulates the baseband signal for transmission. In the reverse path, MPT  conditions, demodulates, and processes the received signal to generate digital data that is sent to the BACKHAUL link via network interface . MPT  also performs some of the Link Access Control (LAC) and Media Access Control (MAC) functions.","MPT  includes an RF transceiver module that perform the RF signal conditioning and interfaces with the antenna. The RF transceiver module includes, for example, the transmit power amplifier, low noise amplifiers, transmit and receive filters, a duplexer, and other RF components. The duplexer multiplexes a receive link with a transmit link on a single antenna. For some low coverage applications, three \u201cpatch\u201d antennas mounted on the MPTs can be utilized instead of conventional antennas.","MPC  performs the radio link controller functions such as, for example, call processing, selection processing, and others. MPC  is also responsible for the Radio Link Protocol (RLP) and some of the Link Access Control (LAC) and Media Access Control (MAC) functions.","Network interface  provides the protocols and transport mechanisms required for access point  to interface with the external IP network. For example, network interface  implements the Point-to-Point Protocol (PPP) and the RADIUS protocol and also includes an integrated router that supports, for example, OSPF and IPSec protocols. Network interface  can also be designed to provide Foreign Agent capability.","Network interface  further provides the physical interfaces for connections to power supplies, the BACKHAULS (e.g., via T1\/E1 or Ethernet), GPS antenna, alarm contacts, and others. Network interface  also typically includes a serial port connection for interfacing to an external computer for local configuration and provisioning. Network interface  may also include an interface to the MPTs. Network interface  performs AC power conversion and conditioning and supplies DC power to other subsystems in access point . Access point  supports external alarm inputs and external relay contact outputs that are configurable by the system operator.","Each access point  is typically associated with a GPS receiver that provides synchronization with the GPS satellite constellation. The GPS receiver can be located (e.g., up to 2000 feet) away from the access point . In the event that synchronization with the GPS satellite constellation is lost, the access point  can \u201cfreewheel\u201d and maintain synchronization with other access points  for a particular time period (e.g., six hours or more).","The MPTs and MPC (if one is present) for access point  can be implemented in multiple units that can be located (e.g., up to 2000 feet) away from each other. In this design, remote I\/O modules can be used to provide the physical interfaces between the units. The remote I\/O modules can interconnect via wireline or wireless links (e.g., RF, optical, and so on).","Access point  can be designed to conform to various specifications depending on the particular system requirements.

The antenna sharing may be achieved with the use of a Receive Multi-Coupler (RMC) unit that supports the sharing of two antennas per sector when operating two frequency assignments (e.g., two 1.25 MHz carriers). In this scenario, one frequency assignment is used by the HDR access point  and the other frequency assignment is used by the CDMA BTS.
