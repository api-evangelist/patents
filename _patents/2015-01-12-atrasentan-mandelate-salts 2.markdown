Atrasentan Mandelate Salts","The present disclosure relates to atrasentan mandelate salts. As with all pharmaceutical compounds and compositions, the chemical and physical properties of atrasentan are important in its commercial development. These properties include, but are not limited to: (1) packing properties such as molar volume, bulk density and hygroscopicity, (2) thermodynamic properties such as melting temperature, vapor pressure and solubility, (3) kinetic properties such as dissolution rate and stability (including stability at ambient conditions, especially to moisture and under storage conditions), (4) surface properties such as surface area, wettability, interfacial tension and shape, (5) mechanical properties such as hardness, tensile strength, compactibility, handling, flow and blend; and (6) filtration properties. These properties can affect, for example, the processing and storage of atrasentan and pharmaceutical compositions comprising atrasentan. Salts, particularly crystalline salts, of atrasentan that improve upon one or more of these properties relative to other salts and\/or solid state forms of atrasentan are desirable.","The atrasentan dosage forms prepared and administered in clinical trials to date have contained crystalline Form II atrasentan monohydrochloride (reported in WO2006\/034084). Form II is the most thermodynamically stable of the three crystalline forms of atrasentan monohydrochloride salts that have been identified (i.e., Form I, Form II, and Form III). Although atrasentan clinical trials have proceeded with crystalline Form II of atrasentan monohydrochloride, efforts have continued to identify alternative atrasentan salts that provide further advantages relative to the monohydrochloride salt.","For example, one property of the crystalline Form I, Form II, and Form III atrasentan monohydrochloride salts that could be beneficially improved is crystal morphology. All of the known atrasentan monohydrochloride salts have a needle morphology that can create challenges during the preparation and formulation of such salts. For example, the needle morphology results in a relatively low bulk powder density that makes powder handling more difficult during the preparation of the atrasentan dosage form. The needle morphology also increases the difficulty of filtration, requiring a longer time in solid-liquid separation. These problems reduce the efficiency of the atrasentan purification (since the mother liquor will be enriched in impurities), increase energy consumption (due to removal of excess residual organic solvent in compliance with International Conference on Harmonization guidelines), and potentially lead to sintering or caking of the solid that may require an additional milling step.","Another property of the monohydrochloride salt that could be beneficially improved is corrosivity. The preparation of the crystalline Form I, Form II, and Form III atrasentan monohydrochloride salts requires the use and handling of corrosive hydrochloric acid and typically is carried out in a glass-lined reactor rather than a standard stainless steel reactor. In addition, during the preparation of the atrasentan monohydrochloride dosage form, the monohydrochloride salt can cause corrosion of the tooling (such as the punch and die of the tablet press) over time. Further, the monohydrochloride salt potentially can decompose to yield hydrogen chloride gas over time and\/or at higher temperatures.","Prior efforts to prepare suitable crystalline forms of atrasentan (including crystalline atrasentan parent, crystalline atrasentan salts other than hydrochloride salts, co-crystals, and crystalline ionic or molecular adducts) have been unsuccessful. Applicant, however, has now succeeded in preparing and isolating crystalline atrasentan mandelate salts and has discovered that such salts have several advantages over the monohydrochloride salt. The mandelate salts exhibit improved crystal morphology and either have a reduced aspect ratio (the ratio of the height of a particle to the cross-sectional dimension of a particle) and are less needle-like or have a plate or prismatic shape. This crystal morphology results in a higher bulk powder density and improved powder handling properties for the mandelate salt. For example, a 120 mg tablet containing 0.75 mg of atrasentan will have a drug loading of 0.67% for the hydrochloride salt (i.e., 0.8025 mg of the hydrochloride salt per tablet) compared to a drug loading of 0.88% for the mandelate salt (i.e., 1.05 mg of the mandelate salt per tablet). As the drug loading increases, the likelihood of achieving acceptable content uniformity also increases. In addition, the improvement in crystal morphology also facilitates solid-liquid separation during filtration.","The mandelate salts also represent an improvement over the hydrochloride salts with respect to corrosivity. There is no need to handle corrosive hydrochloric acid during the preparation of the mandelate salt. Further, the previously-discussed concerns regarding corrosion of tooling and longer-term chemical stability associated with the monohydrochloride salt are materially reduced for the mandelate salt.","Accordingly, in one embodiment the disclosure relates to an atrasentan mandelate salt.

The solution turned pink immediately upon the addition of the atrasentan and no sodium salt of atrasentan was isolated. Because atrasentan generally degrades under basic conditions, it is believed that the atrasentan degraded in the presence of the sodium hydroxide and was not converted into a sodium salt.","Several additional studies were conducted to prepare and isolate atrasentan S-mandelate (particularly crystalline atrasentan S-mandelate) and are described below.","A. Experiment A","About 25 mg of atrasentan parent was suspended in 0.2 mL of an aqueous solution of S-mandelic acid (0.5 M) at room temperature. The suspended solid quickly converted to a gel-like semi-solid when the solution was stirred. After three days of stirring at room temperature, a sample of the suspended semi-solid was inspected under microscope and a few birefringent particles were observed.","B. Experiment B","About 22 mg of atrasentan parent was suspended in 0.25 mL of methanol\/water (50\/50, v\/v) at room temperature. S-Mandelic acid (13.8 mg) was added to the suspension. The suspended solids partially dissolved in the S-mandelic acid and were converted quickly to a gel-like semi-solid. The solution was heated to 40\u00b0 C. and the semi-solid was re-dissolved. The solution was then slowly cooled to room temperature and produced a solid precipitate. The precipitate was isolated, analyzed by PXRD, and determined to be a mixture of an anhydrate of atrasentan S-mandelate (1:1 stoichiometry) and a hemi-hydrate of atrasentan parent.","C. Experiment C","About 100 mg of atrasentan parent was suspended in 1 mL of methanol\/water (1:1, v\/v) at room temperature. S-Mandelic acid (41 mg) was added to the suspension. The majority of the suspended solids dissolved, but a gel-like semi-solid was observed at the bottom of the vial. The suspension was heated to 50\u00b0 C., but the semi-solid remained undissolved. When the suspension was stirred for 10 minutes at 50\u00b0 C., additional precipitation was observed. When the suspension was stirred overnight, the semi-solid partially converted to crystalline particles. A sample of the crystalline particles was analyzed by PXRD and determined to be a mixture of an anhydrate of atrasentan S-mandelate (1:1 stoichiometry) and an anhydrate of atrasentan S-mandelate (2:1 stoichiometry). Additional S-mandelic acid (about 15 mg) was added to the suspension with stirring to further convert the semi-solid to crystalline particles. The resulting crystalline particles were isolated, analyzed by PXRD, and determined to be an anhydrate of atrasentan S-mandelate (1:1 stoichiometry). Increasing the amount of S-mandelic acid present in the suspension resulted in the conversion of the atrasentan S-mandelate (2:1 stoichiometry) to atrasentan S-mandelate (1:1 stoichiometry).","D. Experiment D","About 500 mg of atrasentan parent was dissolved in 2.5 mL methanol at room temperature. S-Mandelic acid (315 mg) was added to the solution. Water was gradually added to the solution in increments of 0.1 mL (to reduce solubility and facilitate precipitation). After a total of 1.5 mL of water had been added to the solution, precipitation of fine particles was observed. An additional amount of S-mandelic acid (about 150 mg) was added to the suspension after 10 minutes followed by an additional amount of water (1 mL). The suspension was then stirred for three hours. The solids present in the suspension were isolated, analyzed by PXRD, and determined to be an anhydrate of atrasentan S-mandelate (1:1 stoichiometry).","E. Experiment E","About 22 mg of atrasentan parent was suspended in 0.25 mL of a methanol\/water (1\/1, v\/v) mixture in a 1 mL scintillation vial at room temperature with stirring. After 9.8 mg of S-mandelic acid had been added to the suspension, the atrasentan was completely dissolved and a semi-solid agglomerate appeared at the bottom of the vial shortly afterwards. The mixture was stirred continuously overnight and the semi-solid agglomerate turned into a white solid that was suspended in the solution. The solid was isolated by filtration and analyzed by PXRD. The PXRD data indicated the solid was a combination of at least two different crystalline forms.","A. Crystallization from Acetonitrile","An excess amount of S-mandelic acid was suspended in acetonitrile (1 mL) to prepare a saturated S-mandelic acid\/acetonitrile solution. After saturation was achieved, the excess S-mandelic acid was removed from the solution by filtration. An excess amount of atrasentan S-mandelate salt (1:1 stoichiometry) was suspended in the S-mandelic acid\/acetonitrile solution at room temperature for three days with stirring. The resulting solid was isolated by filtration and analyzed by PXRD about 10 minutes after isolation (see Example 8).","B. Crystallization from Ethanol","An excess amount of S-mandelic acid was suspended in ethanol (1 mL) to prepare a saturated S-mandelic acid\/acetonitrile solution. After saturation was achieved, the excess S-mandelic acid was removed from the solution by filtration. An excess amount of atrasentan S-mandelate salt (1:1 stoichiometry) was suspended in the S-mandelic acid\/ethanol solution at room temperature for three days with stirring. The resulting solid was isolated by filtration and analyzed by PXRD about 10 minutes after isolation (see Example 8).","C. Crystallization from Pyridine","An excess amount of S-mandelic acid was suspended in pyridine (1 mL) to prepare a saturated S-mandelic acid\/pyridine solution. After saturation was achieved, the excess S-mandelic acid was removed from the solution by filtration. An excess amount of atrasentan S-mandelate salt (1:1 stoichiometry) was suspended in the S-mandelic acid\/ethanol solution at room temperature for three days with stirring. The resulting solid was isolated by filtration and analyzed by PXRD about 10 minutes after isolation (see Example 8).","100.6 mg of atrasentan parent was suspended in 1 mL of a methanol\/water (1\/1, v\/v) mixture in a 4 mL scintillation vial at 50\u00b0 C. with stirring. A semi-solid agglomerate appeared at the bottom of the vial after 31 mg of S-mandelic acid had been added to the suspension. The mixture was stirred continuously for 15 minutes and then the semi-solid agglomerate turned into a white solid that was suspended in the solution. The solid was isolated by filtration and analyzed by PXRD (see Example 8). The solid was found to be a hydrate of atrasentan S-mandelate salt (2:1 stoichiometry).","About 100 mg of atrasentan parent was added to about 1 mL of an R-mandelic acid\/water solution (0.5 M) at room temperature. A gel-like precipitate was observed in the resulting suspension. The suspension was sonicated for 15 minutes and heated to 50\u00b0 C. with stirring. As the suspension was stirred and the temperature maintained at 50\u00b0 C., the gel-like precipitate converted to a white solid. The white solid was isolated, dried, analyzed by PXRD (see Example 8), and determined to be an anhydrate of atrasentan R-mandelate (1:1 stoichiometry).","Atrasentan monohydrochloride (11.42 mg) was added to a 2 mL glass vial containing a mixture of n-butylamine (100 \u03bcL) and isopropanyl acetate (400 \u03bcL) and dissolved by vortexing. A crystalline solid of was collected after the solvent was removed by evaporation under ambient conditions. The crystalline solid was analyzed by PXRD (see Example 8) and determined to be an anhydrate of atrasentan n-butylamine (1:1 stoichiometry).","Although the atrasentan n-butylamine salt was successfully isolated, n-butylamine is generally toxic and an n-butylamine salt is not a pharmaceutically acceptable salt.","The crystal morphology of several different atrasentan salts was assessed by microscopy and the results reported in Table 7-A below.",{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0210","num":"0209"},"tables":{"@attributes":{"id":"TABLE-US-00005","num":"00005"},"table":{"@attributes":{"frame":"none","colsep":"0","rowsep":"0"},"tgroup":{"@attributes":{"align":"left","colsep":"0","rowsep":"0","cols":"3"},"colspec":[{"@attributes":{"colname":"1","colwidth":"63pt","align":"left"}},{"@attributes":{"colname":"2","colwidth":"98pt","align":"left"}},{"@attributes":{"colname":"3","colwidth":"56pt","align":"left"}}],"thead":{"row":[{"entry":"TABLE 7-A"},{"entry":{"@attributes":{"namest":"1","nameend":"3","align":"center","rowsep":"1"}}},{"entry":["ATRASENTAN","ANALYTICAL","CRYSTAL"]},{"entry":["SALT","CHARACTERIZATION","MORPHOLOGY"]},{"entry":{"@attributes":{"namest":"1","nameend":"3","align":"center","rowsep":"1"}}}]},"tbody":{"@attributes":{"valign":"top"},"row":[{"entry":["Parent","Anhydrate","Needle"]},{"entry":["Parent","Quarter-hydrate","Needle"]},{"entry":["Parent","Hemi-hydrate","Prism"]},{"entry":["Hemi-Sulfate","Monohydrate","Needle"]},{"entry":["(1:1 Stoichiometry)","(Example 1, Experiment 2)"]},{"entry":["S-Mandelate","Anhydrate","Prism"]},{"entry":["(1:1 Stoichiometry)","(Example 2, Experiment 4)"]},{"entry":["S-Mandelate","Crystallized From","Prism"]},{"entry":["(1:1 Stoichiometry)","Acetonitrile (Example 3)"]},{"entry":["S-Mandelate","Crystallized From Ethanol","Not"]},{"entry":["(1:1 Stoichiometry)","(Example 3)","Determined"]},{"entry":["S-Mandelate","Crystallized From Pyridine","Not"]},{"entry":["(1:1 Stoichiometry)","(Example 3)","Determined"]},{"entry":["S-Mandelate","Hydrate","Prism"]},{"entry":["(2:1 Stoichiometry)","(Example 4)"]},{"entry":["R-Mandelate","Anhydrate","Prism"]},{"entry":["(1:1 Stoichiometry)","(Example 5)"]},{"entry":["n-Butylamine","Anhydrate","Bar"]},{"entry":["(1:1 Stoichiometry)","(Example 6)"]},{"entry":["Hydrochloride","Crystalline Form I","Needle"]},{"entry":["(1:1 Stoichiometry)","(Reported in WO2006\/034094)"]},{"entry":["Hydrochloride","Crystalline Form II","Needle"]},{"entry":["(1:1 Stoichiometry)","(Reported in WO2006\/034084)"]},{"entry":["Hydrochloride","Crystalline Form III","Needle"]},{"entry":["(1:1 Stoichiometry)","(Reported in WO2006\/034234)"]},{"entry":{"@attributes":{"namest":"1","nameend":"3","align":"center","rowsep":"1"}}}]}}}}},"Microscopic images of (a) atrasentan hemi-sulfate (1:1 stoichiometry), monohydrate, (b) atrasentan S-mandelate salt (1:1 stoichiometry), anhydrate, and (c) atrasentan monohydrochloride salt, crystalline Form II are attached as -A, -B, and -C, respectively.","Several of the atrasentan crystalline forms listed in Table 7-A were analyzed by X-ray powder diffraction (\u201cPXRD\u201d). Specifically, the PXRD studies were performed on a G3000 diffractometer (Inel Corp., Artenay, France) equipped with a curved position sensitive detector and parallel beam optics. The diffractometer was operated with a copper anode tube (1.5 kW fine focus) at 40 kV and 30 mA. An incident beam germanium monochromator provided monochromatic K\u03b11 radiation. The diffractometer was calibrated using the attenuated direct beam at one-degree intervals. Calibration was checked using a silicon powder line position reference standard (NIST 640c). The sample was loaded onto an aluminum sample holder and leveled with a glass slide. The instrument was computer controlled using the Symphonix software (Inel Corp., Artenay, France) and the data was analyzed using the Jade software (version 6.5, Materials Data, Inc., Livermore, Calif.). All studies were conducted at room temperature (i.e., about 25\u00b0 C.).","Tables 8-A through 8-N set out the significant parameters of the main peaks in terms of 2\u0398 values and intensities for the crystalline forms analyzed. It is known in the art that an X-ray powder diffraction pattern may be obtained which has one or more measurement errors depending on measurement conditions (such as equipment, sample preparation or machine used). In particular, it is generally known that intensities in an X-ray powder diffraction pattern may fluctuate depending on measurement conditions and sample preparation. For example, persons skilled in the art of X-ray powder diffraction will realize that the relative intensities of peaks may vary according to the orientation of the sample under testing and on the type and setting of the instrument used. The skilled person also will realize that the position of reflections can be affected by the precise height at which the sample sits in the diffractometer and the zero calibration of the diffractometer. The surface planarity of the sample also may have an effect on the results. A person skilled in the art will appreciate that the diffraction pattern data presented below is not to be construed as absolute and any crystalline form that provides a power diffraction pattern substantially identical to those disclosed below fall within the scope of the present disclosure (for further information see Jenkins, R & Snyder, R.

otherwise indicated, in each Example below: (a) the atrasentan parent tested was the hemi-hydrate, (b) the atrasentan hydrochloride salt tested was the crystalline form II of the monohydrochloride salt, and (c) the atrasentan mandelate salt tested was the anhydrate of the S-mandelate salt (1:1 stoichiometry).","A study is conducted to evaluate the bulk density, tap density, and flow properties of atrasentan parent, atrasentan mandelate salt, and atrasentan hydrochloride salt.","A. General Methods","Bulk and tap density are measured following (USP <616>). Approximately 60 mL of each sample is added into a 100 mL graduated cylinder. The powder is carefully leveled without compacting, and the volume is read directly from the cylinder and used to calculate the bulk density according to the relationship: mass\/volume. The cylinder containing the powder sample is then mechanically tapped using a VanKel Tap Density Tester (Model 50-1200, Varian, Inc., Palo Alto, Calif.) until there is no change in volume. The volume of the sample is then read and used in the calculation of tap density.","Flow properties of each sample are characterized using a Schulze ring shear tester RST-XS (Dietmar Schulze Sch\u00fcttgutmesstechnik, Wolfenb\u00fcttel, Germany). A standard annular cell of a cross-sectional area of 24 cmand a volume of 30 cmis used to measure the yield loci. All experiments are performed at 23\u00b12\u00b0 C. and 33\u00b12% relative humidity to minimize the effects of temperature and moisture on flow properties. During each measurement, the powder is first pre-sheared under a pre-consolidation stress until a steady-state is reached. The pre-sheared powder is then subjected to shear under a normal stress. Thus one shear point of the yield locus, a plot of shear stress at failure as a function of the normal stress, is obtained. To measure another shear point of the yield locus, the sample is then pre-sheared again under the same pre-consolidation stress and sheared to failure under a subsequently increased normal stress. A complete yield locus is then plotted through all measured shear points.","In this study, the procedure is conducted in triplicates with applying pre-consolidation stresses of 1 kPa and four normal stress levels equally spaced between 20 to 60% of the pre-consolidation stress. From each yield locus, major principle stress (\u03c3) and unconfined yield strength (f) are derived by drawing two critical Mohr stress circles with the software RST-CONTROL 95 (Dietmar Schulze Sch\u00fcttgutmesstechnik, Wolfenb\u00fcttel, Germany). The major principle stress (\u03c3) results from the Mohr stress circle which is tangential to the yield locus and intersects at the point of normal and shear stresses at steady state flow. The unconfined yield strength (f) results from the Mohr stress circle which is tangential to the yield locus and runs through the origin. Flow function coefficient (FFC=\u03c3\/f) is used to characterize the flow of a powder.","B. Bulk Density and Tap Density Measurement","Bulk density and tap density were measured for samples of the following materials: (i) unmilled atrasentan hydrochloride salt having the morphology and particle size distribution listed below in Table 10; and (ii) unmilled atrasentan mandelate salt having the morphology and particle size distribution listed below in Table 10. Each sample had a moisture content less than 2% by weight at 80% relative humidity.

A sample (about 5 mg to about 20 mg) of the powder to be tested was loaded onto the tared pan of a DVS Advantage dynamic gravimetric water sorption analyzer (Surface Measurement Systems Ltd, Alperton, United Kingdom). The moisture sorption isotherm for each sample was collected at 10% relative humidity intervals as the relative humidity was adjusted in the following manner: (a) 0% to 90% to 0% to 90% to 40% for the hemi-sulfate salt, and (b) 0% to 90% to 0% for the S-mandelate salt. For each step, the dm\/dt criteria were 0.001% over 5 minutes with a minimum dm\/dt time of 30 minutes and a maximum dm\/dt of 120 minutes. Data was collected isothermally at 25\u00b0 C. with a nitrogen flow rate of 200 cm\/minute. The sample was maintained at 30% relative humidity and analyzed by PXRD.
