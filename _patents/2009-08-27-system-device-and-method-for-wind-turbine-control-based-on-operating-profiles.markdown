Known wind turbines typically include one or more components (e.g., a controller) attached to a wind farm network. Other devices on the network, such as a server, may receive data from the networked components in a wind turbine for uses in facilitating wind farm management.","For example, a wind turbine may be controlled based on operating parameters such as vibration levels at various levels of power output. Such operating parameters are often provided by sensors of the wind turbine. However, known sensors can produce such a large volume of data that extracting useful information from the sensor data may be difficult. Accordingly, it is desirable to provide wind turbine operating information that can be easily interpreted by a human operator and used to optimize wind turbine performance.","This Brief Description is provided to introduce a selection of concepts in a simplified form that are further described below in the Detailed Description.

Graphical interface  populates dimension indicator  with a value appropriate for the operating parameter displayed in parameter indicator .","In the exemplary embodiment, graphical interface  also includes upper bound radio button  and lower bound radio button  for specifying whether a threshold should be an upper bound or a lower bound. Selection of radio buttons  and  is mutually exclusive. If upper bound radio button  is selected, a value less than the value entered in value input field  is considered to be within the threshold. If lower bound radio button  is selected, a value greater than the value entered in value input field  is considered to be within the threshold.","The user may elect to accept the threshold definition in graphical interface  by selecting or engaging an \u201cOK\u201d button . Alternatively, the user may discard the threshold definition in graphical interface  and return to the previous state by selecting or engaging a \u201cCancel\u201d button .","In one embodiment, graphical interface  suggests a threshold by populating value input field  with a value based on statistical information for a selected operating mode. For example, graphical interface  may calculate a suggested value equal to an arithmetic mean for the operating mode plus or minus a predetermined number of standard deviations for the operating mode (e.g., mean plus three standard deviations).","In some embodiments, after the threshold definition in graphical interface  has been accepted, or upon a separate operation (e.g., selecting or engaging an \u201cupload alarms\u201d button, not shown), one or more operating parameter threshold configurations are transmitted to one or more wind turbines. For example, a wind turbine operating threshold may be transmitted to a sensor monitor, via a server and a controller, and saved by the sensor monitor in its memory as an alarm. In addition, or in the alternative, a user may transmit the operating parameter threshold configurations for all displayed thresholds to the sensor monitor.","Described herein are exemplary embodiments of methods and systems that facilitate operation of one or more wind turbines based on operating profiles corresponding to operating modes. Grouping operational data points according to operating mode simplifies the presentation of information to a user, facilitating improved interpretation of the data. Specifically, such presentation facilitates interpretation of how data points cluster by operating mode, how data points vary within an operating mode, how data points compare to existing alarm thresholds, and whether significant outliers exist. Moreover, providing statistical information based on operating modes allows a user to control operation of a wind turbine and\/or set appropriate operating thresholds according to operating mode.","The methods and systems described herein are not limited to the specific embodiments described herein. For example, components of each system and\/or steps of each method may be used and\/or practiced independently and separately from other components and\/or steps described herein. In addition, each component and\/or step may also be used and\/or practiced with other assembly packages and methods.","Some embodiments described involve graphical presentation of operating data. In particular, some embodiments facilitate graphically emphasizing or distinguishing one or more presented elements. Graphical emphasis and distinction may include the use of color (i.e., hue, value, and\/or saturation), shading (e.g., darkening elements other than emphasized elements), a fill pattern (e.g., hatching), line weight, scale (e.g., enlarging an element relative to another), and\/or animation (e.g., blinking), though other forms of graphical emphasis and distinction are also contemplated.","Some embodiments involve the use of one or more electronic or computing devices. Such devices typically include a processor or controller, such as a general purpose central processing unit (CPU), a graphics processing unit (GPU), a microcontroller, a reduced instruction set computer (RISC) processor, an application specific integrated circuit (ASIC), a programmable logic circuit (PLC), and\/or any other circuit or processor capable of executing the functions described herein. The above examples are exemplary only, and thus are not intended to limit in any way the definition and\/or meaning of the term processor.","While the invention has been described in terms of various specific embodiments, those skilled in the art will recognize that the invention may be practiced with modification within the spirit and scope of the claims."],"brief-description-of-drawings":[{},{}],"description-of-drawings":{"heading":"BRIEF DESCRIPTION OF THE DRAWINGS","p":["The embodiments described herein may be better understood by referring to the following description in conjunction with the accompanying drawings.",{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0010","num":"0009"},"figref":"FIG. 1"},{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0011","num":"0010"},"figref":["FIG. 2","FIG. 1"]},{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0012","num":"0011"},"figref":"FIG. 3"},{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0013","num":"0012"},"figref":["FIG. 4","FIG. 2"]},{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0014","num":"0013"},"figref":["FIG. 5","FIG. 2"]},{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0015","num":"0014"},"figref":["FIG. 6","FIG. 2"]},{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0016","num":"0015"},"figref":["FIG. 7","FIG. 2"]}]},"DETDESC":[{},{}]}
