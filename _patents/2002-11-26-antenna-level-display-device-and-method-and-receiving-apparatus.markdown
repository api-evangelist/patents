title: Antenna level display device and method, and receiving apparatus
abstract: An antenna level display device capable of faithfully reflecting any deterioration of a picture quality in receiving a satellite broadcast. In this display device, orthogonal detection of an input signal is executed in a demodulator, and a CN ratio is calculated from a conversion table in a ROM according to the mean value of deflections of mapped points of the received signal on an IQ plane. The demodulated data is compared, in a comparator, with the demodulated data obtained after error correction by a Viterbi decoder, and a CN ratio is calculated on the basis of the bit error rate from a conversion table stored in another ROM. A decision is made to select one CN ratio, which is to be displayed as an antenna level, out of the two calculated CN ratios, and the selected CN ratio is displayed through adaptive switching. Consequently, despite any deterioration of the receiving environment derived from occurrence of phase noise in a converter or the like, it is still possible to display a proper antenna level reflecting the receiving circumstances.

{"@attributes":{"id":"description"},"BRFSUM":[{},{}],"heading":["BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION","SUMMARY OF THE INVENTION","DETAILED DESCRIPTION OF THE PREFERRED EMBODIMENTS"],"p":["The present invention relates to an antenna level display device, an antenna level display method and a receiving apparatus adapted for displaying an antenna level in a digital satellite broadcast receiving tuner or a television receiver having such a tuner therein.","A satellite broadcast receiving tuner or a satellite broadcast receiving apparatus such as a television receiver with an internal tuner is equipped with an antenna level display function for displaying the CN (carrier-to-noise) ratio of an input signal received from a satellite by an antenna. This antenna level display function is utilized to fulfill two broadly classified roles.","The first role is to realize proper directional adjustment of an antenna at the time of installing the antenna and adjusting its direction, in such a manner that the level of the received signal obtained from the antenna becomes maximum. In satellite broadcasting, a parabolic antenna having sharp directivity is used to receive the signal from the satellite. The CN ratio of the received signal is set to a maximum attainable value by properly adjusting the antenna direction while watching the displayed antenna level, so that a wide margin of the CN ratio can be ensured until the reception becomes impossible, hence achieving a satisfactory receiving environment suited to deal with deterioration of the environment due to rainfall or the like.","And the second role is to search for the cause of any disturbance in the reception. Generally, occurrence of a reception disturbance is derived from deterioration of the receiving environment or from some fault in the receiver. It is possible to judge, from the antenna level being displayed, whether the reception disturbance is derived from any environmental deterioration or not. That is, in case the reception disturbance has occurred due to the environmental deterioration, a search is made as to whether the CN ratio of the received signal is sufficiently high or not. And if the antenna level is not sufficient, the disturbance can be judged to result from some environmental deterioration in the reception. In this case, the cause may be such that the antenna is not directed exactly toward the satellite, or there exists a building or the like as an obstacle to the broadcast waves. Also in this case, the cause may include a fault of a converter, breaking of a feeder, failure of a connector and so forth. In contrast therewith, if the antenna level is sufficient, the condition can be so judged that at least the signal from the satellite is properly received by the antenna and that the tuner or the television receiver is probably faulty.","In the conventional analog satellite broadcast receiver, an antenna level is displayed in accordance with the gain of an AGC (Automatic Gain Control) amplifier (as disclosed in, e.g., U.S. Pat. No. 3,134,412). More specifically, an intermediate frequency amplifying stage in the satellite broadcast receiver has an AGC circuit for keeping the level of a received signal constant. In the AGC circuit, the level of the received signal is detected, and then the gain of the AGC amplifier is set in accordance with the detected level of the received signal. And the set gain of the AGC amplifier is displayed as an antenna level.","Thus, in the conventional analog satellite broadcast receiver, the antenna level is displayed on the basis of the gain of the AGC amplifier. However, in a digital satellite broadcast receiver where digital modulation is adopted, a sufficiently high precision is not attainable by displaying the antenna level in accordance with the gain of the AGC amplifier. For this reason, in the known digital satellite broadcast receiver, a CN ratio is calculated from a constellation representing the coordinates of mapped signal points on an IQ plane.","That is, in digital satellite broadcast, 8PSK (Phase Shift Keying) for example is adopted as a modulation mode. In this 8PSK modulation, data are arrayed correspondingly to eight signal points P to P on an IQ plane having an I-axis and a Q-axis orthogonal thereto, as shown in .","Assuming generally that the entire noise included in the signal waves is composed merely of random noise, the points of the received signal are dispersed, as shown in , around signal points S and S which are obtained in an original noiseless state, in a probability distribution conforming with a normal distribution. More specifically, the point of the received signal to be positioned at a signal point S is dispersed as indicated by a curve A in , and also the point of the received signal to be positioned at an adjacent signal point S is dispersed as indicated by a curve A. Due to such dispersion, the received signal within an area L beyond an intermediate point between the signal points S and S of mutually adjacent codes is received as a wrong code.","On the basis of such relationship, the deviation of the received signal point and the CN ratio can be correlated with each other. That is, if the noise included in the signal waves is assumed to be random noise, the deflection of the received signal point on the IQ plane corresponds to the CN ratio.","In calculating the CN ratio from the mean value of the deflections of the received signal points on the IQ plane, the received signal points are mapped on the IQ plane by a demodulator, and then the mean value of the deflections of the individual signal points is measured from the I-signal and the Q-signal. And a measuring system is prepared for setting a modulation signal of a desired CN ratio by superposing random noise. In this measuring system, there is measured the mean value of the deflections of the received signal points. Then a conversion table is formed with regard to the mean value of the measured deflections of the individual signal points and the CN ratio. And the conversion table is stored in a ROM (Read Only Memory).","Upon reception of the input signal, points of the received signal are mapped on the IQ plane by the demodulator, and the mean value of the deflections of the signal points is measured. Then the CN ratio is calculated from the mean value of the deflections of the received signal points by using the conversion table stored in the ROM. And the CN ratio thus obtained from the deflections of the received signal points mapped on the IQ plane is displayed as an antenna level.","In the Japanese digital satellite broadcast, the stationary satellite located above the equator and at 110\u00b0 C. of east longitude is utilized through a network of 12 GHz band, as in the precedent analog satellite broadcast. Therefore, in shifting from the analog satellite broadcast to the digital one, the existing antenna used previously for the analog satellite broadcast is still usable. In shifting from the analog satellite broadcast to the digital one, if the existing antenna for the analog satellite broadcast is used continuously, it is not necessary to purpose a new antenna or to readjust the direction of the antenna either, hence realizing a ready shift from the analog satellite broadcast to the digital one. For this reason, when receiving the digital satellite broadcast, many users continuously use the existing antenna which has been used for receiving the analog satellite broadcast.","However, there is reported a problem that, when receiving the digital satellite broadcast by the antenna used previously for the analog satellite broadcast, a reception disturbance occurs though the displayed antenna level indicates a sufficient CN ratio. The cause of such a problem is considered as follows.","An antenna for receiving a satellite broadcast is equipped internally with a converter for converting a received signal of 12 GHz band into an intermediate frequency signal of 1 GHz band. Some of the known converters in the antennas for receiving the analog satellite broadcast contain much phase noise. However, since the analog satellite broadcast is transmitted through frequency modulation of analog video signal, high tolerance is ensured against the residual FM noise and therefore proper reception can still be achieved even by an antenna equipped with a converter containing much phase noise.","Meanwhile in 8PSK modulation employed for the digital satellite broadcast, the distance between signal points is short and, when the phase noise is great, it is erroneously judged to be an adjacent code by the demodulator, so that the reception characteristic may be deteriorated. Therefore, if the digital satellite broadcast is received by the antenna used originally for receiving the analog satellite broadcast, a reception disturbance may be caused by the phase noise in the converter.","When such a reception disturbance has occurred due to some harmful influence of the phase noise in the converter, an adequate measure may be taken with facility if the antenna level being displayed reflects faithfully the deterioration of the CN ratio derived from the phase noise.","That is, as mentioned, one role of displaying the antenna level is to search for the cause of a reception disturbance upon occurrence of such disturbance. Therefore, the antenna level is confirmed when a reception disturbance has occurred due to some harmful influence of the phase noise in the converter for example. At this time the carrier level to the noise is lowered, so that if the deterioration of the CN ratio derived from the phase noise is faithfully reflected, the CN ratio being displayed as an antenna level is also lowered. And when the antenna level is lowered, it is seen that the cause is not concerned with at least the satellite broadcast receiver or the television receiver and that the cause is derived from deterioration of the receiving environment of the antenna system, whereby an adequate measure may be taken with facility.","However, in the conventional digital satellite broadcast receiver where the noise is assumed to be random noise as mentioned, the CN ratio is calculated from the deflections of the signal points on the IQ plane, so that the deterioration of the CN ratio due to the phase noise fails to be faithfully reflected.","More specifically, in the known method of measuring the CN ratio in the digital satellite broadcast, the noise is assumed to be random noise conforming with a normal distribution, but the noise superposed on the actual received signal is not limited to random noise alone and may include phase noise therein as described. The phase noise partially includes deviations of frequency components.","If the noise is random one conforming with a normal distribution, the points of the received signal are distributed in the shape of a true circle, as shown in . However, if some phase noise is included, the points of the received signal are not distributed in the shape of a true circuit and are dispersed in the circumferential direction, as shown in  (Reference paper: IEEE Trans. On Consumer Electronics, Vol. 41, No. 3, August 1995, \u201cQAM FOR TERRESTRIAL AND CABLE TRANSMISSION\u201d). Therefore, if any phase noise is included in the received signal, exact evaluation of the CN ratio is not attainable according to the known CN ratio conversion table prepared on an assumption that the points of the received signal are distributed in the shape of a true circle.","Thus, in the conventional display of an antenna level in the digital satellite broadcast, the CN ratio fails to be faithfully measured with regard to the phase noise. And therefore, when a reception disturbance has occurred due to the phase noise in the converter for example, the measured CN ratio may erroneously be displayed as a sufficient antenna level. Consequently, the expense burden on both consumers and manufacturers for search, inspection and so forth is rendered great.","There may be contrived a method of adding frequency deviation noise as a new item of phase noise and displaying the same. However, if the random noise and the phase noise are both displayed, the general user is obliged to comprehend the information of such two noises and to deal with them separately, whereby the burden is further increased.","There is known a method of indicating the antenna level by counting the number of actual errors as an index to faithfully represent the harmful influence exerted on the picture quality by the deterioration of the received signal. However, if this method of indicating the antenna level by counting the number of errors is adopted, there arises another problem that the time required for measuring the CN ratio becomes longer with a rise of the CN ratio.",{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0025","num":"0024"},"figref":["FIG. 10","FIG. 10"]},"Thus, in the method to indicate the antenna level by counting the number of errors, longer-time measurement is necessary with a rise of the CN ratio, so that it becomes difficult to adjust the antenna position while watching the displayed antenna level. More specifically, in initial setting, the user adjusts the antenna direction in a manner to maximize the antenna level while watching the displayed antenna level. In this case, it is desired that the time required for attaining a reflection of the CN ratio in the antenna level should be within a range of 0.5 to 1 second. Further, when the antenna position is to be adjusted, reduction of the CN ratio due to attenuation by rainfall or the like needs to be taken into consideration in the digital satellite broadcast, so that it is important to set the antenna level as high as possible at the time of adjusting the antenna level, and the CN ratio needs to be given a wide margin to an unreceivable state. However, in the system of measuring the CN ratio from the bit error rate, it is impossible to achieve proper measurement of the CN ratio in a short time particularly when the CN ratio is high, whereby proper adjustment of the antenna direction is not attainable while watching the indicated antenna level.","It is therefore an object of the present invention to provide an antenna level display device, an antenna level display method and a receiving apparatus capable of displaying, in reception of a satellite broadcast, a proper antenna level which faithfully reflects any deterioration of a picture quality.","And another object of the present invention resides in providing an antenna level display device, an antenna level display method and a receiving apparatus adapted for displaying, when determining the direction of an antenna, a stable antenna level with a sufficiently fast response.","According to a first aspect of the present invention, there is provided an antenna level display device which includes first CN ratio calculating means for calculating a CN ratio based on the deflections of mapped points of a received signal on an IQ plane; second CN ratio calculating means for calculating a CN ratio based on the error rate of the received signal; deciding means for selecting, as an antenna level to be displayed, either the CN ratio calculated by the first CN ratio calculating means and based on the deflections of the mapped points of the demodulated received signal on the IQ plane, or the CN ratio calculated by the second CN ratio calculating means and based on the error rate; and display means for displaying the CN ratio selected as an antenna level by the deciding means.","According to a second aspect of the present invention, there is provided an antenna level display method which includes a step of calculating a CN ratio based on mapped points of a received signal on an IQ plane; a step of calculating a CN ratio based on an error rate; a step of selecting, as an antenna level to be displayed, either the CN ratio based on the mapped points of the received signal on the IQ plane or the CN ratio based on the error rate; and a step of displaying the selected CN ratio as an antenna level.","And according to a third aspect of the present invention, there is provided a receiving apparatus to receive a digital television broadcast. This apparatus includes demodulating means for demodulating a received signal of a digital television broadcast; first CN ratio calculating means for calculating a CN ratio based on the deflections of mapped points of the demodulated received signal on an IQ plane; second CN ratio calculating means for calculating a CN ratio based on the error rate of the demodulated received signal; deciding means for selecting, as an antenna level to be displayed, either the CN ratio calculated by the first CN ratio calculating means and based on the deflections of the mapped points of the received signal on the IQ plane, or the CN ratio calculated by the second CN ratio calculating means and based on the error rate; and display means for displaying the CN ratio selected by the deciding means as an antenna level.","Two techniques are known with respect to detection of a CN ratio. One is carried out by calculating the CN ratio in accordance with the mean value of the deflections of mapped points of a received signal on an IQ plane, and the other is carried out by calculating the CN ratio in accordance with the bit error rate. In the former case of calculating the CN ratio in accordance with the mean value of the deflections of mapped points of a received signal on an IQ plane, high-precision measurement of the CN ratio can be performed stably even in a high C\/N area, but exact evaluation is not attainable with regard to any unexpected noise other than random noise. Meanwhile in the latter case of calculating the CN ratio in accordance with the bit error rate, deterioration of the received signal can be exactly evaluated regardless of the kind of noise, although the response time characteristic is inferior in a high C\/N area.","Therefore, the CN ratio to be displayed is selectively judged from the CN ratio measured in accordance with the mean value of the deflections of mapped points of the received signal on the IQ plane and the CN ratio measured in accordance with the bit error rate, and then the selected one is adaptively switched to be displayed. Consequently, even in case the receiving environment is deteriorated due to some phase noise in the converter or the like, it becomes possible to properly display the antenna level which reflects the receiving circumstance faithfully. And in adjusting the antenna direction while watching the displayed antenna level, the antenna level can be displayed stably with a fast response.","The above and other features and advantages of the present invention will become apparent from the following description that will be given with reference to the illustrative accompanying drawings.","Hereinafter some preferred embodiments of the present invention will be described in detail with reference to the accompanying drawings.  shows an example of a digital satellite broadcast receiving apparatus where the present invention is applied. In , radio waves of a digital satellite broadcast transmitted via a satellite of 12 GHz band for example are received by a parabolic antenna  and then are converted by a converter , which is connected to the parabolic antenna , into a first intermediate frequency signal of 1 GHz band for example. The output of this converter  is supplied to a tuner circuit  via a cable .","A channel selection signal is supplied to the tuner circuit  from a microprocessor . In response to the channel selection signal thus obtained from the microprocessor , the tuner circuit  selects a signal of a desired carrier frequency out of the entire received signals, and then the signal of the selected carrier frequency is converted into a second intermediate frequency signal.","The intermediate frequency signal is supplied from the tuner circuit  to an AGC circuit . The intermediate frequency signal from the tuner circuit  is amplified by the AGC circuit , where the gain is so controlled that the level of the received signal is maintained constant. And the output of the AGC circuit  is supplied to a demodulation circuit .","The demodulation circuit  is capable of performing demodulation in BPSK (Binary Phase Shift Keying), QPSK (Quadrature Phase Shift Keying) and 8PSK (8 Phase Shift Keying) modes.","That is, in digital satellite broadcast, hierarchical transmission is executed in BP-SK, QPSK and 8PSK modes. In the 8PSK mode where the amount of information per symbol is increased, the error rate is deteriorated if there occurs attenuation due to rainfall. Meanwhile in the BPSK or QPSK mode, although the quantity of information per symbol is decreased, the error rate is not so deteriorated despite an attenuation caused due to rainfall.","On the transmitter side, one TS packet is assigned correspondingly to one slot, and individual TS packets are mapped on a frame consisting of 48 slots. A modulation mode and an encoding rate may be allocated to each slot. And the kind of the modulation mode and the encoding rate allocated to each slot are transmitted by a TMCC (Transmission and Multiplexing Configuration Control) signal. A super-frame is composed in unit of eight frames, and interleaving is executed at the position of each slot.","A transport stream is demodulated in the demodulation circuit . The output of the demodulation circuit  is supplied to a Viterbi decoder , which then executes error correction of an inner code. Subsequently the output of the Viterbi decoder  is supplied to an error corrector , which then executes error correction of an outer code.","More specifically, the error correction encoding system employed for digital satellite broadcast includes Reed-Solomon code (204, 188) as an outer code and Trelice code or convolutional code as an inner code. The Viterbi decoder  executes error correction of the inner code, and the error corrector  executes error correction of the outer code based on Reed-Solomon code.","The ouput of the error corrector  is supplied to a descrambler , where CAS (Condition Access System) control is executed.","That is, in the case of limited reception, the transport stream is encrypted. Individual information is stored in an IC card , which is loaded via a card interface .","The descrambler  is supplied with the information of the received ECM (Encryption Control Message) and EMM (Entitlement Management Message) sections, and also with descramble key data stored in the IC card . In the case of limited reception, descrambling is executed in the descrambler  by using the received ECM, EMM and the information of the IC card .","A modem  is provided, and billing information is sent to a program broadcast center via the modem  by means of a telephone line.","The transport stream descrambled in the descramber  is sent to a demultiplexer .","The demultiplexer  separates a stream of desired packets from the received transport stream. A packet identifier (PID) is described in the header of the packet. And in the demultiplexer , the packets are separated, in accordance with the PID, into a video PES (Packetized Elementary Stream) packet, an audio PES packet, a data packet, a PSI (Program Specific Information) packet, and an SI (Specific Information) packet of a desired program.","The video PES packet of the desired program is sent to a video decoder , and the audio PES packet thereof is sent to an audio decoder . Meanwhile the data packet, PSI packet and SI packet are sent to a microprocessor .","The video decoder  receives the video PES packet from the demultiplexer  and then decodes the information in conformity with the MPEG (Moving Picture Coding Experts Group) b  format, thereby reproducing the video signal. The video signal thus reproduced is delivered from an output terminal .","The audio decoder  receives the audio PES packet from the demultiplexer  and then decodes the information in conformity with the MPEG2-AAC (MPEG2 Advanced Audio Coding) format, thereby reproducing the audio signal. The audio signal thus reproduced is delivered from an output terminal .","A manual input is given by means of an input key . Here, the input key  includes various keys and switches arrayed on a panel of a receiver for example. A manual input can also be given by the use of an infrared remote controller  as well. A light sensor  is provided for sensing an infrared command signal emitted from the infrared remote controller , and the output signal from the light sensor  is sent to the microprocessor .","Each of setting modes is executed by a display unit . The display unit  includes, e.g., a liquid crystal display disposed on the panel, LEDs (Light Emitting Diodes) and so forth. Further a display signal from the microprocessor  is supplied to an OSD (On Screen Display) circuit , whose output is then combined with the video signal by an adder . Thus, each of the various setting modes can be displayed in the picture being received.","In the digital satellite broadcast receiver described above, the present invention is adapted for displaying an antenna level on the screen by means of the display unit  or the OSD circuit .",{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0065","num":"0064"},"figref":"FIG. 2"},"In , the received signal is outputted via an AGC circuit , and the output of the AGC circuit  is supplied to a demodulation circuit . The demodulation circuit  includes a local oscillator , multipliers A and B, a 90\u00b0 C. phase shifter , low pass filters A and B, A\/D converters A and B, and a PSK demodulator .","The above local oscillator , multipliers A, B and 9\u00b0 C. phase shifter  constitute an orthogonal detection circuit. The output of the AGC circuit  is supplied to the multipliers A and B. Meanwhile a carrier signal is outputted from the local oscillator . The output of the local oscillator  is supplied to the multiplier A while being supplied via the 90\u00b0 C. phase shifter  to the multiplier B.","The multiplier A multiplies the received signal by the carrier signal obtained from the oscillator . And the multiplier B multiplies the received signal by the 90\u00b0 C. phase shifted carrier signal. An I-axis signal component and a Q-axis signal component are obtained from the multipliers A and B respectively. The outputs of the multipliers A and B are supplied respectively to the low pass filters A and B, wherein the unrequired band components are removed. The outputs of the low pass filters A and B are supplied respectively to the A\/D (Analog to Digital) converters A and B, wherein the I-axis signal component and the Q-axis signal component are digitized. The outputs of the A\/D converters A and B are supplied to the PSK demodulator .","The digitized I-axis and Q-axis signal components are mapped on the IQ plane by the PSK demodulator . And the digital signal is demodulated from the codes allocated to the mapped signal points. Subsequently the digital signal thus demodulated is outputted as a transport stream.","The PSK demodulator  has another function of measuring the mean value of the deflections of the signal points from the demodulated I-axis and Q-axis signal components. The mean value of the deflections of the received signal points is supplied from the PSK demodulator  to a microprocessor . Then the microprocessor  calculates the CN ratio from the mean value of the deflections of the received signal points.","That is, there is prepared a measuring system which is capable of generating a signal modulated to a CN ratio of a desired strength by superposing random noise. This measuring system measures the mean value of the deflections of the signal points on the IQ plane obtained from the PSK demodulator  in the demodulation circuit . As shown graphically in , there is drawn up, from the measured mean value of the deflections of the signal points on the IQ plane, a conversion table related to the mean value (CNRead) of the deflections of the signal points and the CN ratio (CNreg). This conversion table is held in a ROM  of the microprocessor .","Upon reception of a broadcast signal in , the mean value (CNRead) of the deflections of the signal points on the IQ plane obtained from the received signal is supplied from the PSK demodulator  to the microprocessor . As described, the microprocessor  has a ROM  containing a conversion table of the CN ratio (CNreg) to the mean value (CNRead) of the deflections of the signal points. By accessing the table in the ROM , there is calculated the CN ratio (CNreg) corresponding to the mean value (CNRead) of the deflections of the signal points obtained from the received signal.","The data demodulated in the PSK demodulator  is supplied to a Viterbi decoder , which then executes error correction of the inner code by soft decision and maximum likelihood decode. The output of the Viterbi decoder  is supplied to an RS error corrector , which then executes error correction of the outer code based on Reed-Solomon code.","The demodulated data after error correction of the inner code is obtained from the Viterbi decoder , and the output thereof is supplied to a data generator . Subsequently the output of the data generator  is supplied to a comparator . Meanwhile, the demodulated data obtained from the PSK demodulator  prior to the error correction is also supplied to the comparator .","In the comparator , the demodulated data prior to the error correction is compared with the demodulated data obtained after the error correction of the inner code, whereby any bit error is detected. And the output of the comparator  is supplied to a bit error counter  wherein bit errors are counted, so that a bit error rate is calculated.","In the data generator , the data obtained from the Viterbi decoder  is so processed as to enable a comparison of the pre-correction data with the post-correction data. More specifically, a convolutional code is attached as an inner code to the received data prior to error correction. However, since error correction of the inner code is executed in the Viterbi decoder , any convolutional code is not attached to the outut of the Viterbi decoder . Therefore, a convolutional code is attached in the data generator  for enabling a comparison of the pre-correction data with the post-correction data.","The output of the bit error counter  is supplied to the microprocessor , wherein the CN ratio is calculated in accordance with the number of the counted bit errors obtained from the output of the bit error counter .","That is, as in the aforementioned case of calculating the CN ratio from the mean value of the deflections of the received signal points, there is prepared a measuring system which is capable of generating a signal modulated to a desired CN ratio by superposing random noise. This measuring system measures a bit error rate from the output of the bit error counter . Consequently, as shown graphically in , there is drawn up a conversion table related to the bit error rate (BERRead) and the CN ratio (CNBER). This conversion table is held in a ROM  of the microprocessor .","Upon reception of a broadcast signal in , the bit error rate (BERRead) obtained from the received signal is outputted from the bit error counter . And the bit error rate (BERRead) is supplied to the microprocessor . As described, the microprocessor  has a ROM  containing a conversion table of the CN ratio (CNBER) to the bit error rate (BERRead). By accessing the conversion table in the ROM , there is calculated the CN ratio (CNBER) corresponding to the bit error rate (BERRead) of the received signal.","Thus, in this example, one CN ratio is calculated from the mean value of the deflections of the received signal points, and another CN ratio is calculated from the bit error rate. Then in a decider  of the microprocessor , the CN ratio more adapted to the receiving circumstances is selected on the basis of the CN ratio obtained from the deflections of the received signal points and also on the basis of the CN ratio obtained from the bit error rate. And the CN ratio thus selected is displayed as an antenna level on the display unit  (or the OSD circuit ).","It is generally usual that the signal environment is judged to be good or bad with reference to the CN ratio, and therefore the CN ratio is employed as a most reliable scale for evaluation of an antenna level. Assuming that the kind of the noise included in the received signal is random noise as described, since the noise conforms with a normal distribution, a set of points of the received signal extends radially in the shape of a true circle in accordance with an increase of the noise intensity. It has been customary heretofore that the radius and the CN ratio are made to have a mutual correspondence of 1:1, and a conversion table is drawn up with regard to the mean value of the deflections of the received signal points and the CN ratio. However, this method is premised on an assumption that the noise in the signal is random noise conforming with a normal distribution. And in case the noise includes some phase noise for example, the calculated CN ratio fails to exactly reflect the signal environment.","In this embodiment, therefore, both the CN ratio calculated from the mean value of the deflections of the mapped points of the received signal on the IQ plane, and the CN value calculated from the bit error rate, are selectively used to display the proper CN ratio that faithfully reflects the signal environment.",{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0083","num":"0082"},"figref":["FIG. 5","FIG. 5"],"sub":["\u2014","\u2014"]},"In , first the mean value (CNRead) of the deflections of the mapped points of the received signal on the IQ plane is obtained from the PSK demodulator  (step ST), and the CN ratio (CNreg) obtained from the deflections of the mapped points of the received signal on the IQ plane is calculated by accessing the ROM  (step ST).","Then the bit error rate (BERRead) is obtained from the output of the bit error counter  (step ST), and the CN ratio (CNBER) based on the bit error rate is calculated from the bit error rate (BERRead) by accessing the ROM .","Subsequently the CN ratio (CNreg) obtained from the mean value (CNRead) of the deflections of the mapped signal points on the IQ plane is compared with the CN ratio (CNBER) obtained from the bit error rate (CNBER) (step ST).","It is supposed here that generally the CN ratio (CNreg) obtained from the mean value of the deflections of the signal points is substantially equal to the CN ratio (CNBER) obtained from the bit error rate.","If the result of such a comparison at step ST indicates that the CN ratio (CNreg) obtained from the deflections of the mapped signal points on the IQ plane is equal to the CN ratio obtained from the bit error rate, or the CN ratio (CNreg) obtained from the deflections of the signal points is lower than the CN ratio (CNBER) obtained from the bit error rate, then the CN ratio (CNreg) obtained from the deflections of the signal points is selected to be displayed (i.e., CN=CNreg) (step ST), and the selected CN ratio is displayed as an antenna level on the display unit  (or the OSD circuit ) (step ST).","In general, the CN ratio (CNreg) obtained from the mean value of the deflections of the signal points is substantially equal to the CN ratio (CNBER) obtained from the bit error rate, whereby the result of the decision made at step ST signifies that the CN ratio (CNreg) obtained from the deflections of the mapped signal points on the IQ plane is equal to the CN ratio (CNBER) obtained from the bit error rate. In this case, the displayed antenna level is represented by the CN ratio (CNreg) obtained from the deflections of the mapped signal points on the IQ plane.","However, if there exists some other factor than the random noise such as phase noise for example, it may occur that the CN ratio (CNBER) obtained from the bit error rate is lowered while the CN ratio (CNreg) obtained from the deflections of the mapped signal points on the IQ plane is not so changed.","In case the result of the decision at step ST signifies that the CN ratio (CNBER) obtained from the bit error rate is lower than the CN ratio (CNreg) obtained from the deflections of the mapped signal points on the IQ plane, the CN ratio (CNBER) obtained from the bit error rate is selected to be displayed (i.e., CN=CNBER) (step ST), and the selected CN ratio is displayed as an antenna level on the display unit  (or the OSD circuit ) (step ST).","Due to the processing routine mentioned above, when the CN ratio is high to ensure a fast response and a high resolution (i.e., when the bit error rate is low), the antenna level is displayed by using the CN ratio (CNreg) obtained from the mean value of the deflections of the mapped signal points on the IQ plane, similarly to display of the antenna level in the known digital satellite broadcast receiver. In case the picture quality is deteriorated by some other noise, such as phase noise, than the random noise, the CN ratio (CNBER) obtained by conversion from the bit error rate is displayed as an antenna level which reflects deterioration of the signal.","In general, an error correction code is functionally inferior in correcting continuous burst noise rather than any noise caused at random timing. Therefore, momentary and successive bit errors derived from burst noise have such characteristic that the picture quality deterioration is sharper than that relative to the random noise caused with the same probability. Consequently, despite the same bit error rate, the picture quality deterioration is rendered different depending on the kind of the noise.","Calculation of the CN ratio from the bit error rate may be executed by shortening the time of evaluation of the bit error rate and achieving a fast response to the bit errors generated successively in a short period of time.","However, if the time of evaluating the bit error rate is shortened, the CN ratio is rendered unstable when the entire CN ratio is high as a whole, hence lowering the precision. More specifically, when the CN ratio is high, it follows the burst errors as obvious from , although a long time is required for measurement. Therefore, if the time of evaluating the error rate is shortened, the antenna level fails to serve as a reference value since the precision becomes extremely rough.","In contrast therewith, the CN ratio based on the mean value of the deflections of the mapped signal points on the IQ plane is calculated by measuring all the mapped signal points, hence acquiring a set of signal points at the highest bit rate in the entire stream flowing in the receiver. Further, as such signal points are averaged, a stable value is attainable. Consequently, when the CN ratio is high, it is possible to perform high-precision measurement of the CN ratio. On the other hand, it becomes impossible, during the averaging process, to discriminate between the burst noise and the random noise.","In view of the above problem, there may be contrived a technique of using, as a high-stability index, the CN ratio obtained from the mean value of the deflections of the mapped signal points on the IQ plane while using, as a fast-response index, the CN ratio obtained from the bit error rate.","This method is carried out fundamentally by executing the flowchart of , wherein \u201cCNreg\u2266CNBER\u201d in the branch process at step ST is replaced with \u201cCNreg\u2266CNBER+CNmargin\u201d. Due to the additional provision of CNmargin, the instability of the CN ratio (CNBER) obtained from the bit error rate is truncated to a certain degree as an error (CNmargin). And when the C\/N is high, the CN ratio (CNreg) obtained from the mean value of the deflections of the mapped signal points on the IQ plane is selectively used to attain a stable antenna level. Meanwhile, if any fall of the CN ratio (CNBER) based on the bit error rate beyond CNmargin can be read out, it is regarded as occurrence of a burst error, and therefore the CN ratio (CNBER) based on the bit error rate is selectively used, so that the antenna level can also reflect the signal deterioration derived from the burst error.","In the digital satellite broadcast, it is possible to perform transmission by multiplexing a plurality of moduation modes such as BPSK, QPSK and 8PSK. The characteristic of the CN ratio to the bit error rate is different in accordance with each of the individual modulation modes, and error correction can be executed within different ranges of the CN ratio respectively.","The characteristic of the CN ratio to the bit error rate is typically such that, when the CN ratio is high, an errorless state is kept continuously with the bit error rate being substantially zero, and when the CN ratio is lowered below a certain degree and under the limit of an error correction code, the detectable error rate is saturated. Consequently, in converting the CN ratio from the bit error rate, there is a limitation with regard to the area where the relationship between the bit error rate and the CN ratio changes linearly.","In the present digital satellite broadcasting, many services are transmitted in the 8PSK mode, while TMCC data are transmitted invariably in the BPSK mode. Thus, two modulation modes of 8PSK and BPSK are employed substantially in most transponders.","There may be contrived an improved method which calculates a higher-precision CN ratio by selectively switching the characteristic curves of the CN ratio and the bit error rate in such two modulation modes and utilizing merely the selected portions where a superior linearity is obtainable.",{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0103","num":"0102"},"figref":["FIG. 6","FIG. 6"],"b":["1","2"]},"Therefore, when the CN ratio is obviously low, BPSK is selected and the bit error rate (BERRead) therein is measured. And the CN ratio (CNBER) is calculated from the read bit error rate (BERRead) in accordance with the curve B that represents the relationship between the bit error rate and the CN ratio in BPSK.","In case the CN ratio has risen gradually and reached a certain point where the calculated CN ratio (CNBER) is over a predetermined value T, measuring the bit error rate is switched from BPSK to 8PSK. And the CN ratio (CNBER) is calculated from the read bit error rate (BERRead) in accordance with the curve B that represents the relationship between the bit error rate and the CN ratio in 8PSK.","Contrary to the above, when the CN ratio is obviously high, 8PSK is selected and the bit error rate (BERRead) therein is measured. And the CN ratio (CNBER) is calculated from the read bit error rate (BERRead) in accordance with the curve B that represents the relationship between the bit error rate and the CN ratio in 8PSK.","In case the CN ratio has fallen gradually and reached a certain point where the calculated CN ratio (CNBER) is under a predetermined value T, measuring the bit error rate is switched from 8PSK to BPSK. And the CN ratio (CNBER) is calculated from the read bit error rate (BERRead) in accordance with the curve B that represents the relationship between the bit error rate and the CN ratio in BPSK.","Thus, only the partial characteristics each having a superior linearity are selectively utilized by switching the conversion tables of the CN ratio and the bit error rate in the two modulation modes, hence achieving satisfactory detection of the CN ratio to the bit error rate with the better characteristics. And a hysteresis characteristic is attained in each of the modulation switching point T where the CN ratio is ascendant and the modulation switching point T where the CN ratio is descendant, thereby realizing more stable CN ratio conversion with higher precision.","In the above embodiment, calculation of the CN ratio from the bit error rate is executed by comparing the demodulated data prior to error correction with the demodulated data obtained after correction of the inner code by Viterbi decoding and then counting the data to calculate the error rate. However, the error rate may be calculated from the data of the outer code.","As described, detection of the CN ratio is performed by a method of calculating the CN ratio in accordance with the mean value of the deflections of the mapped points of the received signal on the IQ plane, or by a method of calculating the CN ratio in accordance with the bit error rate. In one case of calculating the CN ratio from the deflections of the mapped points of the received signal on the IQ plane, high-precision measurement of the CN ratio can be achieved stably even in a high C\/N area, but exact evaluation is not attainable with regard to any other unexpected noise than ramdom noise. Meanwhile in another case of calculating the CN ratio from the bit error rate, any deterioration of the received signal can be exactly evaluated regardless of the kind of the noise, although the response time characteristic is inferior in a high C\/N area.","In the present invention, therefore, the CN ratio to be displayed is determined selectively in accordance with the result of a decision made about the CN ratio measured on the basis of the mean value of the deflections of the mapped signal points on the IQ plane, and also about the CN ratio measured on the basis of the bit error rate, and the result is adaptively switched to display the selected CN ratio. Consequently, even if the receiving environment is deteriorated due to some phase noise in the converter or the like, it is still possible to display the proper antenna level that faithfully reflects the receiving circumstances. And in adjusting the direction of the antenna while watching the antenna level, the stable antenna level can be displayed with a fast response.","Although the present invention has been described hereinabove with reference to some preferred embodiments thereof, it is to be understood that the invention is not limited to such embodiments alone, and a variety of other changes and modifications will be apparent to those skilled in the art without departing from the spirit of the invention.",{"@attributes":{"id":"h-0005","num":"0000"},"figref":["FIG. 1","FIG. 2"]},{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0113","num":"0112"},"b":"7"},{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0114","num":"0113"},"b":"8"},{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0115","num":"0114"},"b":"19"},{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0116","num":"0115"},"b":"25"},{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0117","num":"0116"},"b":"57"},{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0118","num":"0117"},"b":"58"},{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0119","num":"0118"},"b":"59"},{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0120","num":"0119"},"b":"63"},{"@attributes":{"id":"h-0006","num":"0000"},"figref":"FIG. 3"},"Deflection of signal point","C\/N [db]",{"@attributes":{"id":"h-0007","num":"0000"},"figref":"FIG. 4"},"Bit error rate","C\/N [dB]",{"@attributes":{"id":"h-0008","num":"0000"},"figref":"FIG. 5"},"Start\n\n","Bit error rate C\/N [dB]",{"@attributes":{"id":"h-0009","num":"0000"},"figref":"FIG. 7"},"Q-axis I-axis",{"@attributes":{"id":"h-0010","num":"0000"},"figref":"FIG. 8"},"Inter-code distance",{"@attributes":{"id":"h-0011","num":"0000"},"figref":"FIG. 9"},"Q-axis I-axis",{"@attributes":{"id":"h-0012","num":"0000"},"figref":"FIG. 10"},"C\/N [dB] Bit error rate\n\n"],"brief-description-of-drawings":[{},{}],"description-of-drawings":{"heading":"BRIEF DESCRIPTION OF THE DRAWINGS","p":[{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0035","num":"0034"},"figref":"FIG. 1"},{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0036","num":"0035"},"figref":"FIG. 2"},{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0037","num":"0036"},"figref":"FIG. 3"},{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0038","num":"0037"},"figref":"FIG. 4"},{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0039","num":"0038"},"figref":"FIG. 5"},{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0040","num":"0039"},"figref":"FIG. 6"},{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0041","num":"0040"},"figref":"FIG. 7"},{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0042","num":"0041"},"figref":"FIG. 8"},{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0043","num":"0042"},"figref":"FIGS. 9A and 9B"},{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0044","num":"0043"},"figref":"FIG. 10"}]},"DETDESC":[{},{}]}
