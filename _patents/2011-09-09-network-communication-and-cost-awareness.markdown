For example, users may interact with a desktop computer, a mobile phone, a tablet computer, and so on to interact via wired or wireless networks.","Conventional techniques that were employed to access these networks, however, were often inefficient and therefore could consume a significant amount of resources, including power, processing, and network resources. Consequently, these conventional techniques could limit functionality available to a user of the device.","Network communication and cost awareness techniques are described. In one or more implementations, functionality is exposed through one or more application programming interfaces (APIs) that is accessible to a plurality of applications of the computing device to perform network communication. Data is returned to one or more of the plurality of applications regarding a cost network used to perform the network communication.","In one or more implementations, functionality is exposed through one or more application programming interfaces (APIs) of an operating system that are accessible to a plurality of applications of the computing device to perform network communication. The functionality to perform network communication is managed by the operating system using one or more policies.","In one or more implementations, one or more computer-readable storage media comprise instructions stored thereon that, responsive to execution by a computing device, causes the computing device to implement an operating system configured to expose functionality via one or more application programming interfaces (APIs) to a plurality of applications of the computing device to perform a download via a cost network while at least a portion of a respective application that requested communication is in a suspended state.","This Summary is provided to introduce a selection of concepts in a simplified form that are further described below in the Detailed Description. This Summary is not intended to identify key features or essential features of the claimed subject matter, nor is it intended to be used as an aid in determining the scope of the claimed subject matter.","Overview","Conventional techniques that were utilized to perform downloads were often fractured and did not address considerations other than performing the download itself. Consequently, these convention techniques did not address considerations relating to use of cost networks, such as possible financial implications to a user of excessive downloads and \u201cgoing over a cap.\u201d Further, these conventional techniques typically did not address power consumption considerations in performing the download.","Network communication and cost awareness techniques are described. In one or more implementations, functionality is exposed via application programming interfaces that may be used to manage usage of a cost network. For example, these APIs may be involved in network communication performed by applications of a computing device, such as to act as an intermediary to one or more network interface devices. As such, the functionality may aware of the network communication performed by the applications, including interaction with a cost network. The functionality may then be used to help manage usage of the cost network, such as to inform of an amount of usage, automatically cease downloads when \u201cover a cap,\u201d and so on.","This functionality may also be employed for a variety of techniques that do not (but may) involve cost networks. For example, these techniques may manage network usage using policies that may relate to a variety of different considerations, such as power considerations, download rates, type of data involving in network communication, and so on. In another example, these techniques may be employed while at least a part of an application is in a suspended state, which may serve to further conserve resources of a computing device. A variety of other examples are also contemplated, further discussion of which may be found in relation to the following figures.","In the following discussion, an example environment is first described that may employ the techniques described herein. Example procedures are then described which may be performed in the example environment as well as other environments. Consequently, performance of the example procedures is not limited to the example environment and the example environment is not limited to performance of the example procedures.","Example Environment",{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0021","num":"0020"},"figref":"FIG. 1","b":["100","100","102","104","106","108","110","112","114","112","112"]},"The computing device  may be configured in a variety of ways. For example, the computing device  may be configured as a computer that is capable of communicating over the network , such as a desktop computer, a mobile station, an entertainment appliance, a set-top box communicatively coupled to a display device, a wireless phone, a game console, and so forth. Thus, the computing device  may range from full resource devices with substantial memory and processor resources (e.g., personal computers, game consoles) to a low-resource device with limited memory and\/or processing resources (e.g., traditional set-top boxes, hand-held game consoles). Additionally, although a single computing device  is shown, the computing device  may be representative of a plurality of different devices, such as multiple servers utilized by a business to perform operations (e.g., a server farm), a remote control and set-top box combination, an image capture device and a game console, and so on.","Although the network  is illustrated as the Internet, the network may assume a wide variety of configurations. For example, the network  may include a wide area network (WAN), a local area network (LAN), or an intranet and thus the network interface device  may be configured to access these networks via a wired connection. The network  may also be configured for access via wireless techniques, such as a wireless wide area network (WWAN), a wireless local area network (WLAN), a cellular network (e.g., a 3G, 4G, LTE network), and so on. The network interface device  may be representative of physical devices and also virtual network devices, such as those used to support a virtual private network, tunneling, and so on. Thus, although a single network  is shown, the network  may be representative of a plurality of networks.","The computing device  is further illustrated as including an operating system . The operating system  is configured to abstract underlying functionality of the computing device  to applications ,  that are executable on the computing device . For example, the operating system  may abstract processing system , memory , power source  (e.g., battery or wired connection), and\/or display device  functionality of the computing device  such that the applications ,  may be written without knowing \u201chow\u201d this underlying functionality is implemented. The applications , , for instance, may provide data to the operating system  to be rendered and displayed by the display device  without understanding how this rendering may be performed.","Likewise, the operating system  may also abstract network connection functionality to the applications ,  through use of a network manager module . The network manager module  is representative of functionality to manage usage of the network interface device  by the applications ,  as well as operation of the network interface device , itself. For example, the network manager module  may manage communication of applications ,  with one or more endpoints  via the network , such as a network service that may be used to manage a website, store data (e.g., images), communicate messages, and so on. Although the network manager module  and its corresponding cost awareness module  and integration module  are illustrated as part of the operating system , it should be readily apparent that this functionality may be implemented by a variety of different entities. Examples of such entities include standalone applications, third-party plugins, and so on.","The network manager module  may incorporate a variety of different functionality to perform this management. For example, the network manager module  may incorporate a cost awareness module  that is representative of functionality to manage interaction with a cost network. The network interface device , for instance, may be configured to interact with a cost network that allots different amounts of data communication for different fees, such as a flat rate for a capped amount with additional fees for overages, a tiered structure, and so on.","Accordingly, the cost awareness module  may employ techniques to manage interaction with these cost networks. The cost awareness module  may do so by exposing functionality via an application programming interface such that the applications ,  may leverage these techniques without having to incorporate the functionality themselves. Further discussion of functionality of the cost awareness module  may be found in relation to .","The network manager module  is further illustrated as including an integration module . The integration module  is representative of functionality to integrate the functionality of the network manager module  with execution of the applications , . For example, the integration module  may support techniques to manage and maintain network connections with the endpoint . This may include pausing and resuming performance of a download, scheduling network communication, and so on. Further discussion of functionality of the integration module  may be found in relation to .","Thus, the network manager module  may be used to expose application programming interfaces to a plurality of applications ,  to access functionality to perform network communication. Further, these application programming interfaces may be configured to communicate back to the applications ,  as well as to the network interface device . Thus, a variety of different techniques may be implemented for management of network  access, such as cost awareness, resource usage (e.g., by a processing system , memory , power source , and display device ), maintenance of network connections, and so on. A variety of other functionality is also contemplated. For example, the network manager module  may support a progressive download and playback, e.g., by hooking into a stream layer such that data may be composed as downloaded.","Generally, any of the functions described herein can be implemented using software, firmware, hardware (e.g., fixed logic circuitry), or a combination of these implementations. The terms \u201cmodule,\u201d \u201cfunctionality,\u201d and \u201clogic\u201d as used herein generally represent software, firmware, hardware, or a combination thereof. In the case of a software implementation, the module, functionality, or logic represents program code that performs specified tasks when executed on a processor (e.g., CPU or CPUs). The program code can be stored in one or more computer readable memory devices. The features of the network broker techniques described below are platform-independent, meaning that the techniques may be implemented on a variety of commercial computing platforms having a variety of processors.","For example, the computing device  may also include an entity (e.g., software) that causes hardware of the computing device  to perform operations, e.g., processors, functional blocks, and so on. For example, the computing device  may include a computer-readable medium that may be configured to maintain instructions that cause the computing device, and more particularly hardware of the computing device  to perform operations. Thus, the instructions function to configure the hardware to perform the operations and in this way result in transformation of the hardware to perform functions. The instructions may be provided by the computer-readable medium to the computing device  through a variety of different configurations.","One such configuration of a computer-readable medium is signal bearing medium and thus is configured to transmit the instructions (e.g., as a carrier wave) to the hardware of the computing device, such as via a network. The computer-readable medium may also be configured as a computer-readable storage medium and thus is not a signal bearing medium. Examples of a computer-readable storage medium include a random-access memory (RAM), read-only memory (ROM), an optical disc, flash memory, hard disk memory, and other memory devices that may use magnetic, optical, and other techniques to store instructions and other data.",{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0033","num":"0032"},"figref":["FIG. 2","FIG. 1"],"b":["200","126","122","200","122","116"]},"The network manager module  is illustrated as exposing functionality to a plurality of applications , , e.g., via one or more application programming interfaces. As previously described, this functionality may relate to network communication  over a network  using one or more network interface devices . For example, the network manager module  may be configured as a central point that manages interaction of the applications ,  with network interface devices  configured to access wireless (e.g., Wi-Fi, Cellular) or wired networks. Thus, the network manager module  may have an \u201cawareness\u201d of the network communication  performed by the network interface device  for the applications ,  and even services of the operating system , itself.","Therefore, the applications ,  may \u201coffload\u201d management of network communication , which may be used to support a variety of features. In one or more implementations, privileges of the application that corresponds to the network communication  are maintained to perform the network communication, thereby protecting against elevation of privileges that may be exploited by malicious parties and reducing a chance of \u201cleakage\u201d across processes.","One such feature may permit network communication to be performed on behalf of the applications ,  while the applications are in a suspended state. Thus, resource usage of the applications ,  may be minimized. The applications ,  may be placed in a suspended state due to a variety of different factors.","For example, the operating system  may be configured to place the applications ,  in a suspended state when focus is moved to another application. The focus may be moved by minimizing a user interface of the application, movement of the user interface (e.g., window) from a foreground in a desktop user interface as shown in the display device  in  in which focus is given to an email application and not a browser or word processing application. The focus may also be moved through navigation away from the user interface of the application ,  in an immersive environment, e.g., a user interface corresponding to the applications ,  is \u201coff screen.\u201d Thus, the operating system  may conserve resources of the computing device  by suspending execution of applications that are not available, directly, for user interaction.","The applications ,  themselves may also be configured to increase efficiency of resource usage of the computing device . For example, application  may be vectored to form different parts that may be executed separately. An illustrated example of this for application  includes vectoring of network functionality  as separate from other functionality  of the application , such as functionality involved in the generation of a user interface for the application . Thus, the network functionality  may be keep active while the other functionality  (e.g., UI functionality) of the application  is suspended. Therefore, all or a part of the application  may be suspended during operation of the network manager module  to perform network communication  on behalf of the application . In other words, the execution of the network manager module  may be \u201csandboxed away\u201d from execution of the applications , , e.g., through implementation on different processes.","The network manager module  may also support a variety of other functionality that may be exposed for usage by the applications , . Examples of such functionality are illustrated in  through a report module  and a policy module .","The report module  is representative of functionality of the network manager module  to \u201creport back\u201d to the applications , . For example, the report manager module  may provide information to an application  regarding network communication  that corresponds to the application . This may include a status of an upload or download performed for the application , amount of time used to perform the communication, whether the communication is completed, and so forth.","In another example, this report module  may provide information that relates to network usage by other applications. The report module , for instance, may report the status of a download or upload performed for application  to application . This information may also include data describing overall usage (e.g., usage by both applications , ), such as amount of an allocation of a cost network that has been consumed by the applications , , whether a cost threshold has been reached, a current cost of network communication  (e.g., which may be indicated per application, indicate a particular network), amount of data uploaded or downloaded over particular connections, and so on. Thus, the report module  may keep the applications ,  informed as to network communication  performed by the computing device .","The policy module  is representative of functionality of the network manager module  to employ one or more policies to manage network communication . The policy may involve a variety of different factors that may be used to manage network communication . In one such example, the policy may be configured to specify a rate of communication (e.g., download) to be employed for a particular application, over a particular network, at particular times, and so on. In another such example, the policy may be used to mark data to be communicated to change host or network behavior (e.g., in accordance with IPv6) regarding communication of the data. The policy module , for instance, may mark content as involving media which may be handled differently by the network  than other data, e.g., using prioritization.","In an additional example, a policy may specify how the network manager module  addresses power consumption considerations. The policy, for instance, may specify network communication  is performed at specified times, a network interface device  is woken at specified intervals from a suspended state to perform communications, use of coalesced communications from a plurality of applications, and so on. Additional discussion of scheduling, which may support power considerations, may be found in relation to .","In a further example, the policy may specify how data is to be obtained. The policy, for instance, may indicate that the data is to be downloaded via a Wi-Fi connection, if available, but not via a cost network such as a 3G, 4G, LTE cellular network. Thus, in such instances the policy may be configured so that the data may be downloaded for reduced cost and may even involve reduced consumption of resources, e.g., a lower powered radio of the network interface device .","In yet another example, a policy may specify how the network manager module  addresses a cost network. The policy, for instance, may specify that network communication  is prohibited when a cost threshold is reached, may cause output of a user interface that includes a prompt and an option that is selectable to \u201cok an overage,\u201d and so forth. A variety of other examples of policies and functionality that may be managed through use of policies may be found in relation to the following figure.",{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0046","num":"0045"},"figref":["FIG. 3","FIG. 1","FIG. 3"],"b":["300","124","122","122","118","120","302","304"]},"The pause\/resume module  is representative of functionality of the computing device  to pause and\/or resume network communication. An application , for instance, may involve network communication with a \u201cone time URL,\u201d such as to provide login credentials, interact with a secure site, and so on. Accordingly, the pause-resume module  may be configured to persist state between the application  and the endpoint , even when confronted with a network  outage.","The pause\/resume module , for instance, may persist data available before a start of a network communication, which may include request headers provided by the application, cookies, a request entity body (e.g., for POST\/PUT requests), a method name (e.g., for HTTP requests such as GET, POST), a destination path (e.g., a final location of downloaded file), a temporary path (e.g., location of the partially downloaded file).","Data may also be persisted that is received after a response from the endpoint , such as response headers, information whether communication is configured to be resumed or not, and so on. Other data that may be persisted may include data that may change during a network communication may include state of communication (e.g., \u201cuploading,\u201d \u201cdownloading,\u201d \u201cpaused\u201d), a current work item identifier, and so on.","Thus, if the endpoint  becomes unavailable during a network communication, the pause\/resume module  may be used to \u201ccontinue where it left off\u201d so that data does not need to be communicated again, even in an instance of a \u201cone time URL.\u201d Naturally other examples are also contemplated without departing from the spirit and scope thereof and it should be readily apparent that these techniques are equally applicable for network availability, computing device  initiated pause event (e.g., due to a policy), and so on.","The scheduling module  is representative of functionality of the computing device  to integrate with the applications ,  to schedule network communication. This scheduling may be performed by leveraging policies as previously described to address a variety of situations.","The scheduling module , for instance, may be used to coalesce communications to be performed for the applications , . The scheduling module  may then cause the network interface device  to wake at intervals and communicate the coalesced communications, e.g., in parallel. In this way the integration module  may be used to efficiency manage power consumption of the network interface device . Other scheduling may also be performed by the scheduling module , including scheduling when inbound communications are to be provided to one or more of the applications ,  from the network interface device .","Example Procedures","The following discussion describes network communication and cost awareness techniques that may be implemented utilizing the previously described systems and devices. Aspects of each of the procedures may be implemented in hardware, firmware, or software, or a combination thereof. The procedures are shown as a set of blocks that specify operations performed by one or more devices and are not necessarily limited to the orders shown for performing the operations by the respective blocks. In portions of the following discussion, reference will be made to the environment  of  and the systems ,  of , respectively.",{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0055","num":"0054"},"figref":["FIG. 4","FIGS. 1-3"],"b":["400","402","122","118","120","114"]},"Data is returned to one or more of the plurality of applications regarding a cost network used to perform the network communication (block ). The report module , for instance, may return data regarding bandwidth usage, which applications ,  use an allocation and how much is used, a notification that a cost threshold is to be exceeded, and so on. This data may be returned to the applications , , output in a user interface for viewing by a user, and so on.","The functionality to perform network communication is managed using one or more policies (block ). As previously described, policies may be utilized to describe and address a variety of scenarios. For example, the policy may be configured to manage the functionality based on one or more power consumption considerations, manage a rate of a download, manage a download based on availability of particular networks, coalesce downloads for the plurality of applications, cause a plurality of downloads to be performed in parallel for the plurality of applications, and so on.","Example System and Device",{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0059","num":"0058"},"figref":["FIG. 5","FIG. 1"],"b":["500","102","500"]},"In the example system , multiple devices are interconnected through a central computing device. The central computing device may be local to the multiple devices or may be located remotely from the multiple devices. In one embodiment, the central computing device may be a cloud of one or more server computers that are connected to the multiple devices through a network, the Internet, or other data communication link. In one embodiment, this interconnection architecture enables functionality to be delivered across multiple devices to provide a common and seamless experience to a user of the multiple devices. Each of the multiple devices may have different physical requirements and capabilities, and the central computing device uses a platform to enable the delivery of an experience to the device that is both tailored to the device and yet common to all devices. In one embodiment, a class of target devices is created and experiences are tailored to the generic class of devices. A class of devices may be defined by physical features, types of usage, or other common characteristics of the devices.","In various implementations, the computing device  may assume a variety of different configurations, such as for computer , mobile , and television  uses. Each of these configurations includes devices that may have generally different constructs and capabilities, and thus the computing device  may be configured according to one or more of the different device classes. For instance, the computing device  may be implemented as the computer  class of a device that includes a personal computer, desktop computer, a multi-screen computer, laptop computer, netbook, and so on.","The computing device  may also be implemented as the mobile  class of device that includes mobile devices, such as a mobile phone, portable music player, portable gaming device, a tablet computer, a multi-screen computer, and so on.
