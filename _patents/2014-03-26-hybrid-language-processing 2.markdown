{"@attributes":{"id":"description"},"BRFSUM":[{},{}],"heading":["BACKGROUND","BRIEF SUMMARY","DETAILED DESCRIPTION"],"p":["Field","The subject matter disclosed herein relates to electronically interpreting user commands and more particularly relates to hybrid language processing.","Description of the Related Art","Computing devices typically include natural language processing capabilities. This ability to electronically interpret user commands provides enhanced ability to operate the computing device.","However, in many circumstances, the interpretation of terms included in the natural language may depend on where the term is used. In some examples, specific terms may have one meaning to a specific user, but may not have significant meaning in a general sense. For example, \u201cBill's House\u201d may have specific meaning to a computing device with a contact list that includes \u201cBill,\u201d but may not have meaning away from the local computing device. For example, without local information regarding the identity of \u201cBill,\u201d a general language processor may not be able to determine who or where Bill is.","In another example, a command such as \u201ccall Mary\u201d may be interpreted locally to be a command to call a contact with a name \u201cMary.\u201d In other examples, a natural language command may be more complex. For example, an inquiry such as \u201cHow do I get from Bill's House to Oracle Arena?\u201d Such a command may not be interpreted locally because \u201cOracle Arena\u201d may not be known at the local computing device. Such a command may not be interpreted generally because \u201cBill's House\u201d may not be known to a general language processor.","An apparatus for hybrid language processing is disclosed. In one embodiment, the apparatus includes a processor, and a memory that stores code executable by the processor. In one embodiment, the code includes code that identifies one or more user specific terms in a user generated portion of text, code that modifies the portion of text by replacing one or more of the user specific terms with general tokens, and code that converts the modified portion of text to one or more commands to be executed by the processor. A method and computer program product also perform the functions of the apparatus.","As will be appreciated by one skilled in the art, aspects of the embodiments may be embodied as a system, method or program product. Accordingly, embodiments may take the form of an entirely hardware embodiment, an entirely software embodiment (including firmware, resident software, micro-code, etc.) or an embodiment combining software and hardware aspects that may all generally be referred to herein as a \u201ccircuit,\u201d \u201cmodule\u201d or \u201csystem.\u201d Furthermore, embodiments may take the form of a program product embodied in one or more computer readable storage devices storing machine readable code, computer readable code, and\/or program code, referred hereafter as code. The storage devices may be tangible, non-transitory, and\/or non-transmission. The storage devices may not embody signals. In a certain embodiment, the storage devices only employ signals for accessing code.","Many of the functional units described in this specification have been labeled as modules, in order to more particularly emphasize their implementation independence. For example, a module may be implemented as a hardware circuit comprising custom VLSI circuits or gate arrays, off-the-shelf semiconductors such as logic chips, transistors, or other discrete components. A module may also be implemented in programmable hardware devices such as field programmable gate arrays, programmable array logic, programmable logic devices or the like.","Modules may also be implemented in code and\/or software for execution by various types of processors. An identified module of code may, for instance, comprise one or more physical or logical blocks of executable code which may, for instance, be organized as an object, procedure, or function. Nevertheless, the executables of an identified module need not be physically located together, but may comprise disparate instructions stored in different locations which, when joined logically together, comprise the module and achieve the stated purpose for the module.","Indeed, a module of code may be a single instruction, or many instructions, and may even be distributed over several different code segments, among different programs, and across several memory devices. Similarly, operational data may be identified and illustrated herein within modules, and may be embodied in any suitable form and organized within any suitable type of data structure. The operational data may be collected as a single data set, or may be distributed over different locations including over different computer readable storage devices. Where a module or portions of a module are implemented in software, the software portions are stored on one or more computer readable storage devices.","Any combination of one or more computer readable medium may be utilized. The computer readable medium may be a computer readable storage medium. The computer readable storage medium may be a storage device storing the code. The storage device may be, for example, but not limited to, an electronic, magnetic, optical, electromagnetic, infrared, holographic, micromechanical, or semiconductor system, apparatus, or device, or any suitable combination of the foregoing.","More specific examples (a non-exhaustive list) of the storage device would include the following: an electrical connection having one or more wires, a portable computer diskette, a hard disk, a random access memory (RAM), a read-only memory (ROM), an erasable programmable read-only memory (EPROM or Flash memory), a portable compact disc read-only memory (CD-ROM), an optical storage device, a magnetic storage device, or any suitable combination of the foregoing. In the context of this document, a computer readable storage medium may be any tangible medium that can contain, or store a program for use by or in connection with an instruction execution system, apparatus, or device.","Code for carrying out operations for embodiments may be written in any combination of one or more programming languages, including an object oriented programming language such as Java, Smalltalk, C++ or the like and conventional procedural programming languages, such as the \u201cC\u201d programming language or similar programming languages. The code may execute entirely on the user's computer, partly on the user's computer, as a stand-alone software package, partly on the user's computer and partly on a remote computer or entirely on the remote computer or server. In the latter scenario, the remote computer may be connected to the user's computer through any type of network, including a local area network (LAN) or a wide area network (WAN), or the connection may be made to an external computer (for example, through the Internet using an Internet Service Provider).","Reference throughout this specification to \u201cone embodiment,\u201d \u201can embodiment,\u201d or similar language means that a particular feature, structure, or characteristic described in connection with the embodiment is included in at least one embodiment. Thus, appearances of the phrases \u201cin one embodiment,\u201d \u201cin an embodiment,\u201d and similar language throughout this specification may, but do not necessarily, all refer to the same embodiment, but mean \u201cone or more but not all embodiments\u201d unless expressly specified otherwise. The terms \u201cincluding,\u201d \u201ccomprising,\u201d \u201chaving,\u201d and variations thereof mean \u201cincluding but not limited to,\u201d unless expressly specified otherwise. An enumerated listing of items does not imply that any or all of the items are mutually exclusive, unless expressly specified otherwise. The terms \u201ca,\u201d \u201can,\u201d and \u201cthe\u201d also refer to \u201cone or more\u201d unless expressly specified otherwise.","Furthermore, the described features, structures, or characteristics of the embodiments may be combined in any suitable manner. In the following description, numerous specific details are provided, such as examples of programming, software modules, user selections, network transactions, database queries, database structures, hardware modules, hardware circuits, hardware chips, etc., to provide a thorough understanding of embodiments. One skilled in the relevant art will recognize, however, that embodiments may be practiced without one or more of the specific details, or with other methods, components, materials, and so forth. In other instances, well-known structures, materials, or operations are not shown or described in detail to avoid obscuring aspects of an embodiment.","Aspects of the embodiments are described below with reference to schematic flowchart diagrams and\/or schematic block diagrams of methods, apparatuses, systems, and program products according to embodiments. It will be understood that each block of the schematic flowchart diagrams and\/or schematic block diagrams, and combinations of blocks in the schematic flowchart diagrams and\/or schematic block diagrams, can be implemented by code. These code may be provided to a processor of a general purpose computer, special purpose computer, or other programmable data processing apparatus to produce a machine, such that the instructions, which execute via the processor of the computer or other programmable data processing apparatus, create means for implementing the functions\/acts specified in the schematic flowchart diagrams and\/or schematic block diagrams block or blocks.","The code may also be stored in a storage device that can direct a computer, other programmable data processing apparatus, or other devices to function in a particular manner, such that the instructions stored in the storage device produce an article of manufacture including instructions which implement the function\/act specified in the schematic flowchart diagrams and\/or schematic block diagrams block or blocks.","The code may also be loaded onto a computer, other programmable data processing apparatus, or other devices to cause a series of operational steps to be performed on the computer, other programmable apparatus or other devices to produce a computer implemented process such that the code which execute on the computer or other programmable apparatus provide processes for implementing the functions\/acts specified in the flowchart and\/or block diagram block or blocks.","The schematic flowchart diagrams and\/or schematic block diagrams in the Figures illustrate the architecture, functionality, and operation of possible implementations of apparatuses, systems, methods and program products according to various embodiments. In this regard, each block in the schematic flowchart diagrams and\/or schematic block diagrams may represent a module, segment, or portion of code, which comprises one or more executable instructions of the code for implementing the specified logical function(s).","It should also be noted that, in some alternative implementations, the functions noted in the block may occur out of the order noted in the Figures. For example, two blocks shown in succession may, in fact, be executed substantially concurrently, or the blocks may sometimes be executed in the reverse order, depending upon the functionality involved. Other steps and methods may be conceived that are equivalent in function, logic, or effect to one or more blocks, or portions thereof, of the illustrated Figures.","Although various arrow types and line types may be employed in the flowchart and\/or block diagrams, they are understood not to limit the scope of the corresponding embodiments. Indeed, some arrows or other connectors may be used to indicate only the logical flow of the depicted embodiment. For instance, an arrow may indicate a waiting or monitoring period of unspecified duration between enumerated steps of the depicted embodiment. It will also be noted that each block of the block diagrams and\/or flowchart diagrams, and combinations of blocks in the block diagrams and\/or flowchart diagrams, can be implemented by special purpose hardware-based systems that perform the specified functions or acts, or combinations of special purpose hardware and code.","The description of elements in each figure may refer to elements of proceeding figures. Like numbers refer to like elements in all figures, including alternate embodiments of like elements.",{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0034","num":"0033"},"figref":"FIG. 1","b":["100","102","104","120"]},"In one embodiment, the processor  may include any type of microprocessor capable of executing executable code. The processor  may include one or more cores, dies, chips, or the like. The processor  may implement a reduced instruction set, or a complex instruction set, or other, or the like. Of course, one skilled in the art may appreciate other types of configurations of processors and this disclosure is meant to include all such processors.","In one embodiment, the apparatus  may include a memory  that stores code executable by the processor. The memory  may include volatile memory, non-volatile memory, or other, or the like. The memory , may include a wide variety of storage memory types, such as, but not limited to, read only memory, random access memory, solid state memory, or other, or the like, as one skilled in the art may appreciate.","In one embodiment, the apparatus  may include a hybrid language module . In one embodiment, the hybrid language module  may include code that identifies one or more user specific terms in a user generated portion of text. In one embodiment, the user generated portion of text includes results of a speech to text processor. In one example, the apparatus  may receive an audio signal that represents the portion of text. The apparatus  may convert the audio signal to the portion of text. In another embodiment, the hybrid language module  may receive the portion of text from a remote computing device, or other, or the like. Of course, one skilled in the art may appreciate a wide variety of different ways in which speech from a user may be converted to text. In another embodiment, the user generated portion of text may include a user entering text into the apparatus  using a keyboard, or other text input device. Therefore, user generated may include any way that a user may cause a portion of text to be generated.","In one embodiment, the hybrid language module  may parse the text in order to determine sentences. The hybrid language module  may analyze the sentences to determine subjects, objects, verbs, or the like, as one skilled in the art may appreciate. In one embodiment, an object, or subject of a sentence may include more than one term. For example, the terms \u201cHenry Wilson\u201d may correlate to a single token. In another embodiment, each word in the sentence may be an individual token.","In another embodiment, the hybrid language module  may parse the text into a plurality of tokens. As previously described, the tokens may include more than one term. The tokens may be compared with user specific terms to determine if any of the tokens have user specific meaning. In one example, the hybrid language module  may compare the tokens to contacts in a contact list at the apparatus. In response to a token matching an entry in a list of contacts, the hybrid language module  may identify the token as having a user specific meaning. In other examples, the hybrid language module  may look up tokens in a local library of terms.","In one embodiment, the local library of terms may include users in a contact list, searched terms at a web browser, names of installed applications, or other keywords that may have local significance or meaning.","In one embodiment, the hybrid language module  may replace user specific terms with general tokens that are general terms. User specific terms may include terms that have local meaning beyond a general meaning. User specific terms may include terms that may be translated to general language that may be understood by a general language processor. For example, a general language processor may not be able to resolve \u201cMike's House,\u201d but may be able to resolve a complete address for \u201cMike's House.\u201d Therefore, the user specific term may include \u2018Mike's House,\u201d whereas the general tokens may be general language that includes the complete address for \u201cMike's House.\u201d","In one example, the hybrid language module  may have identified a user specific token as \u201cMike's House.\u201d The hybrid language module  may replace \u201cMike's House\u201d with general tokens that include a complete address based on an entry in a contact list. For example, the hybrid language module  may replace \u201cMike's House\u201d with \u201c543 East 899 North, Salt Lake City, Utah.\u201d","In another example, the hybrid language module  may replace \u201cMike's House\u201d with a general token that is a template token. For example, the hybrid language module  may replace \u201cMike's House\u201d with the template token \u201cLOCATION.\u201d Of course, other template tokens may be used to represent user specific terms, such as, but not limited to, PRODUCT, ACTION, COMMAND, BUSINESS, PERSON, or other, or the like. As used herein, a template token may be capitalized so as to indicate that the term is a template token.","In one example, the portion of text may include \u201crecommend the ThinkPad Tablet to Jane.\u201d The hybrid language module  may identify \u201cJane\u201d as a user specific term, and may replace \u201cJane\u201d with a general token that may be a template token, such as, \u201cPERSON.\u201d The hybrid language module  may replace \u201cJane\u201d with \u201cPERSON\u201d resulting in the modified portion of text including \u201crecommend the ThinkPad Tablet to PERSON.\u201d In one embodiment, a general language processor may be able to interpret \u201crecommend the ThinkPad Tablet to PERSON,\u201d while a general language processor may not be able to interpret \u201crecommend the ThinkPad Tablet to Jane.\u201d","Furthermore, the hybrid language module  may replace \u201cThinkpad Tablet\u201d to \u201cPRODUCT\u201d resulting in the modified portion of text including \u201crecommend the PRODUCT to PERSON.\u201d The hybrid language processor may convert the portion of text to a \u201crecommend\u201d command. In one example, the recommend command may include an email, a telephone call, a text message, a social networking post, a post on another server, or the like. Therefore, the command \u201crecommend PRODUCT to PERSON\u201d may include emailing recommending text regarding the PRODUCT to the PERSON.","In this example, the hybrid language module  may replace the template tokens (PRODUCT, PERSON) with general information. For example, the hybrid language module  may replace \u201cPRODUCT\u201d with the ThinkPad Tablet, and may replace \u201cPERSON\u201d with Jane's email. Therefore, a resulting command may include emailing recommending text regarding the ThinkPad Tablet to Jane's email.","In another example, the hybrid language module  may replace the user specific terms with general tokens that include general language. In a similar example, the hybrid language module  may replace the \u201cJane\u201d token with general language that includes Jane's email before the general language processor converts the portion of text to a command. In one embodiment, the command may be executed by the processor .","In one embodiment, the hybrid language module  may further modify the portion of text by replacing one or more user specific terms with general language and template tokens. In one example, the hybrid language module  may generate a structure that includes the portion of text, the modified portion of text, the user specific terms, template tokens, or other related tokens, or the like.","For example, where the portion of text includes \u201cRecommend my tablet to Bill,\u201d the hybrid language module  may modify the portion of text by replacing user specific terms (i.e. \u201cmy tablet\u201d and\/or \u201cBill\u201d), with template tokens (i.e. \u201cPRODUCT\u201d and\/or \u201cPERSON\u201d). The hybrid language module , may generate a structure that includes the portion of text before modifications, the modified portion of text, template tokens, general language, general tokens, or other related text, or other tokens, or the like. Therefore, the hybrid language module  may include any and\/or all related text information in a logical structure to encapsulate the information.","For example, the hybrid language module  may generate a structure as follows:",{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0051","num":"0050"},"tables":{"@attributes":{"id":"TABLE-US-00001","num":"00001"},"table":{"@attributes":{"frame":"none","colsep":"0","rowsep":"0"},"tgroup":[{"@attributes":{"align":"left","colsep":"0","rowsep":"0","cols":"2"},"colspec":[{"@attributes":{"colname":"offset","colwidth":"21pt","align":"left"}},{"@attributes":{"colname":"1","colwidth":"196pt","align":"left"}}],"thead":{"row":{"entry":[{},{"@attributes":{"namest":"offset","nameend":"1","align":"center","rowsep":"1"}}]}},"tbody":{"@attributes":{"valign":"top"},"row":{"entry":[{},"{"]}}},{"@attributes":{"align":"left","colsep":"0","rowsep":"0","cols":"2"},"colspec":[{"@attributes":{"colname":"offset","colwidth":"35pt","align":"left"}},{"@attributes":{"colname":"1","colwidth":"182pt","align":"left"}}],"tbody":{"@attributes":{"valign":"top"},"row":[{"entry":[{},"\u201ctext\u201d: \u201cRecommend my PRODUCT to PERSON\u201d,"]},{"entry":[{},"\u201cPRODUCT\u201d: {"]}]}},{"@attributes":{"align":"left","colsep":"0","rowsep":"0","cols":"2"},"colspec":[{"@attributes":{"colname":"offset","colwidth":"63pt","align":"left"}},{"@attributes":{"colname":"1","colwidth":"154pt","align":"left"}}],"tbody":{"@attributes":{"valign":"top"},"row":[{"entry":[{},"\u201cmaker\u201d: \u201cLenovo\u201d,"]},{"entry":[{},"\u201cname\u201d: \u201cThinkPad Tablet\u201d"]}]}},{"@attributes":{"align":"left","colsep":"0","rowsep":"0","cols":"2"},"colspec":[{"@attributes":{"colname":"offset","colwidth":"49pt","align":"left"}},{"@attributes":{"colname":"1","colwidth":"168pt","align":"left"}}],"tbody":{"@attributes":{"valign":"top"},"row":{"entry":[{},"},"]}}},{"@attributes":{"align":"left","colsep":"0","rowsep":"0","cols":"2"},"colspec":[{"@attributes":{"colname":"offset","colwidth":"35pt","align":"left"}},{"@attributes":{"colname":"1","colwidth":"182pt","align":"left"}}],"tbody":{"@attributes":{"valign":"top"},"row":{"entry":[{},"\u201cPERSON\u201d: {"]}}},{"@attributes":{"align":"left","colsep":"0","rowsep":"0","cols":"2"},"colspec":[{"@attributes":{"colname":"offset","colwidth":"63pt","align":"left"}},{"@attributes":{"colname":"1","colwidth":"154pt","align":"left"}}],"tbody":{"@attributes":{"valign":"top"},"row":[{"entry":[{},"\u201cname\u201d: \u201cBill Murray\u201d,"]},{"entry":[{},"\u201cemail\u201d: \u201cbill@murray.com\u201d,"]},{"entry":[{},"\u201cphone\u201d: \u201c800-777-1234\u201d"]}]}},{"@attributes":{"align":"left","colsep":"0","rowsep":"0","cols":"2"},"colspec":[{"@attributes":{"colname":"offset","colwidth":"49pt","align":"left"}},{"@attributes":{"colname":"1","colwidth":"168pt","align":"left"}}],"tbody":{"@attributes":{"valign":"top"},"row":{"entry":[{},"}"]}}},{"@attributes":{"align":"left","colsep":"0","rowsep":"0","cols":"2"},"colspec":[{"@attributes":{"colname":"offset","colwidth":"21pt","align":"left"}},{"@attributes":{"colname":"1","colwidth":"196pt","align":"left"}}],"tbody":{"@attributes":{"valign":"top"},"row":[{"entry":[{},"}"]},{"entry":[{},{"@attributes":{"namest":"offset","nameend":"1","align":"center","rowsep":"1"}}]}]}}]}}},"In one example, the structure may include braces to logically identify corresponding fields. In other examples, the structure may be enclosed in braces, brackets, bars, or other symbols, or the like. In another example, various fields or values may be enclosed in tags as one skilled in the art may appreciate. In one example, the encapsulated structure may include hyper-text markup language, a script object notation, other notation, or the like. The structure may include a \u201ctext\u201d field that may include the user generated portion of text. The \u201ctext\u201d field may include a modified portion of text that may include template tokens, such as, but not limited to \u201cPRODUCT,\u201d \u201cPERSON,\u201d or other template tokens as described herein.","The structure may include a brace delineated field to encapsulate a user specific meaning for a template token. In one example, the structure may include a \u201cPRODUCT\u201d field. Encapsulated in the \u201cPRODUCT\u201d field may be product related information, such as, but not limited to, make, model, count, version, price, sales date, or the like. In another example, the structure may include a delineated \u201cPERSON\u201d field. The \u201cPERSON\u201d field, in one example, may include name, age, gender, race, religion, size, height, weight, hobbies, phone number, related usernames, email, address, or other identifying information, any combination of the foregoing, or the like. Of course, other template tokens may be used to represent other information, for example, template tokens may include, PLACE, LOCATION, TIME, PRODUCT, PERSON, DATE, APPLICATION, DEVICE, SOFTWARE, OPERATING SYSTEM, VERSION, or other, or the like. Therefore, in certain embodiments, the template tokens may represent any information relative to the general tokens, user specific meanings, or other, or the like.","The structure may encapsulate additional information to further describe the template tokens. For example, as depicted in the structure above, the hybrid language module  may generate a structure that includes identifying information for a PERSON, such as, but not limited to, a name, an email, a phone number, or the like. For example, the structure may include the PERSON's name, \u201cBill Murray,\u201d the PERSON's email, \u201cbill@murray.com,\u201d and\/or the PERSON's phone number, \u201c800-777-1234,\u201d or other, or the like.","In one embodiment, the hybrid language module  may transmit the generated structure to a remote server  for conversion.
