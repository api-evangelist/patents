{"@attributes":{"id":"description"},"BRFSUM":[{},{}],"heading":["FIELD OF THE INVENTION","BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION","SUMMARY","DETAILED DESCRIPTION OF AN ILLUSTRATIVE IMPLEMENTATION"],"p":["This invention relates in general to the field of information deployment and configuration between cooperating parties. More particularly, this invention relates to the automated super effective and efficient deployment (SEED) of information and configuration variables between cooperating parties.","To succeed in the modern, competitive business environment, companies are working to maximize efficiency and decrease resource expenditure. Companies have adopted and implemented various technologies to increase operational efficiency. The use of technology can often make the difference between success and failure in the ultra-competitive business environment. From mobile telephones to fully integrated mobile personal digital assistants (PDAs) the business world is keen to adopt and incorporate new technologies to better serve their clients and to realize a competitive edge over market competitors. Most often clients\/partners provide the incentive to the corporate world to evaluate, adopt, and implement technologies. As clients\/partners become more technologically aware, so too must the companies servicing them. Hallmark evidence of the impact of technology on the corporate world is simply found by looking at the numerous electronic mail computing applications that exist today. It is difficult to think of a time when the corporate world did not rely on e-mail as a primary mode of communication.","The infrastructure that allows for the communication of electronic mail, also serves a basis for other intra-enterprise and inter-enterprise applications that allow for information and knowledge sharing. The infrastructure described is networked computing environments. With the proliferation of computer networks, a plethora of computing applications allowing for knowledge sharing and the communication of information have been developed. From project management computing applications, to data storage document management computing applications, to business process management and communication computing applications, computer networks have allowed companies today to perform processes more efficiently and optimally. A recent addition to this list of helpful tools is the business process server computing application. The business process server computing application enabled the electronic development and management of business processed within and between organizations. With the business process server computing application, information technology organizations can easily build distributed business processes that integrate applications and partners, as well as quickly establish reliable, secure trading relationships with customers and key partners using public computer networks (such as the Internet).","Currently, companies employ business process server computing applications for knowledge sharing and information communication between themselves and various partners. In this context, the business process computing application serves as a relationship management and fostering tool. As a management tool, current implementations of business process server computing applications tend to be passive in nature, often requiring expert manual oversight for updates to any configurations between the cooperating parties. The benefits realized by current implementations of business process server computing applications are astounding. Companies can share various data with their partners\/client that assist with various business processes including but not limited to: transaction fulfillment, inventory management, customer relationship management, billing, and accounting.","However, there are many shortcomings with existing business process server computing applications. May of the problems arise with trading partners and are caused by a lack of both user experience and technical expertise when handling electronic data exchanges. A number of challenges are often encountered including: each cooperating party requiring significant amounts of support when testing the business process server computing application across the various cooperating parties, the deployment of new and existing technologies taking longer than anticipated, project status often not visible to the account representative during the testing process, and the support of non-cooperating parties. As more parties cooperate with a particular implementation of a business process server computing application, configuration management and configuration information deployment become tantamount to the success of the application and its general efficacy.","From the foregoing, it is appreciated that there exists a need for a system and methods that ameliorate the shortcomings of existing practices.","A system and methods allowing for the deployment of configuration information associated data between cooperating parties cooperating to operate a business process server computing application are provided. In an illustrative implementation, a networked computing environment operating either within and\/or between enterprises executes a business process server computing application. The business process computing application is a distributed computing application operating in whole and\/or in part in one ore more cooperating computing environments. The computing application comprises a configuration management and configuration management deployment tool that operates to ensure seamless persistent configuration between the various parties cooperating to operate the business process server computing application.","In operation, the configuration management and configuration information communication\/deployment tool is integrated within the cooperating parties local computing environments. Upon integration, the cooperating party selects using the configuration management and configuration information communication\/deployment tool packages for local installation in the computing environment supporting the business process server computing application. Generally, these packages are associated with the specific business implementation streams needed by the cooperating party to conduct their business with other cooperating parties operating the business process server computing application.","The configuration management and configuration information communication\/deployment tool allows cooperating partners to then perform a closed loop test on the local computing environment after installing the desired packages to ensure that channels and ports have been correctly configured. Furthermore, the configuration management and configuration information communication\/deployment tool allows the cooperating party to run a bouncer test (e.g. a transaction simulation test) with the business process server computing application installation, passing data through the computer network environment and with other cooperating parties operating the business process server computing application and then receiving data through their local installation to verify the proper configuration.","Upon completing the tests, the cooperating party may use the configuration management and configuration information communication\/deployment tool to send a request to a cooperating party to realize one or more functions offered by the business process server computing application. If the request is accepted, the function is performed. If the request is rejected, an e-mail originated by the business process server computing application is send to the requesting party providing the reason for the rejection of the request as well as providing additional configuration management information that if implemented would resolve any outstanding conflicts or problems.","Additional features and advantages of the invention will be made apparent from the following detailed description of illustrative embodiments that proceeds with reference to the accompanying drawings.","Overview","Business process server computing applications are a recent addition to the corporate computing landscape. With business process server computing applications, companies may leverage knowledge and communication vital transaction information with partners\/clients to facilitate and foster the business relationship. For example, in the stream of commerce context, a supplier of a widget that may be used in the manufacture of wadgets may cooperate with one or more manufacturers of wadgets through a business process server computing application to facilitate the order, transaction, fulfillment, delivery, and inventory control of needed widgets. These functions which may, in the paper world, be tracked by various transaction documents such as purchase orders, invoices, delivery status reports, and inventory reports having such information are electronically managed by a business process server computing application such that the information in these reports and invoices (and the reports and invoices themselves\u2014e.g. templates of a purchase order, invoice, delivery status report, inventory report, etc.) is electronically generated, managed, and stored by the business process server computing application.","In operation, the business process computing application acts to manage and foster relationships between cooperating parties. Specifically, the business process computing application serves as an data exchange between cooperating parties that offers various information representative of the relationship between the various cooperating parties. As an exchange, a certain amount of expertise is required to install and configure the application by the cooperating parties to reflect one or more changes of the nature, scope, and operation of these described relationships (e.g. supplier\/buyer\u2014business-to-business, supplier\/buyer\u2014business-to-consumer, etc.).","Current implementations of business process server computing applications are configuration static in that they require significant expenditure of resources in the form of labor and time to integrate one or more changes to one or more relationships between the cooperating parties operating the business process server computing application. Such expenditure can be extremely costly in the form of lost revenues to trading partners.","The present invention aims to ameliorate the shortcomings of existing implementations by offering a comprehensive configuration management and configuration information communication\/deployment system and methods that cooperate with business process server computing applications to more efficiently and automatically configure and\/or re-configure the business process server computing applications to be responsive to business practice changes. As such, changes in business practices can more easily and reliably be propagated and deployed between and among cooperating parties operating a business process server computing application.","It is appreciated that although a business process server computing application is described to support the inventive concepts described herein, that such computing application is merely offered for illustration purposes as the inventive concepts described herein may be applied to various computing applications operating in various computing environments including but not limited to c-commerce exchanges, data warehousing computing applications, and information technology provisioning applications.","Exemplary Computing Environment",{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0024","num":"0023"},"figref":"FIG. 1","b":["100","100","100","100"]},"The invention is operational with numerous other general purpose or special purpose computing system environments or configurations.

Computer readable media can be any available media that can be accessed by computer  and includes both volatile and non-volatile media, removable and non-removable media. By way of example, and not limitation, computer readable media may comprise computer storage media and communication media.

By way of example, and not limitation, communication media includes wired media such as a wired network or direct-wired connection, and wireless media such as acoustic, RF, infrared and other wireless media. Combinations of any of the above should also be included within the scope of computer readable media.","The system memory  includes computer storage media in the form of volatile and\/or non-volatile memory such as ROM  and RAM . A basic input\/output system  (BIOS), containing the basic routines that help to transfer information between elements within computer , such as during start-up, is typically stored in ROM .

Individuals and business users alike are provided with a seamlessly interoperable and web-enabled interface for applications and computing devices, making computing activities increasingly web browser or network-oriented.","For example, MICROSOFT\u00ae's NET platform includes servers, building-block services, such as Web-based data storage and downloadable device software. Generally speaking, the .NET platform provides (1) the ability to make the entire range of computing devices work together and to have user information automatically updated and synchronized on all of them, (2) increased interactive capability for Web sites, enabled by greater use of XML rather than HTML, (3) online services that feature customized access and delivery of products and services to the user from a central starting point for the management of various applications, such as e-mail, for example, or software, such as Office .NET, (4) centralized data storage, which will increase efficiency and ease of access to information, as well as synchronization of information among users and devices, (5) the ability to integrate various communications media, such as e-mail, faxes, and telephones, (6) for developers, the ability to create reusable modules, thereby increasing productivity and reducing the number of programming errors, and (7) many other cross-platform integration features as well.","While exemplary embodiments herein are described in connection with software residing on a computing device, one or more portions of the invention may also be implemented via an operating system, application programming interface (API) or a \u201cmiddle man\u201d object between a coprocessor and requesting object, such that services may be performed by, supported in, or accessed via all of .NET's languages and services, and in other distributed computing frameworks as well.","Efficient Information Deployment",{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0040","num":"0039"},"figref":"FIG. 3","b":["1","1","1","2","3","4","5","6","7","8","9","2","3","4","5","6","7","8","9","1"]},"In an illustrative implementation, an exemplary business process server computing application may operate among the various cooperating parties shown in  to facilitate one or more portions of a business process between one or more of the shown cooperating parties. For example, cooperating party  CP may be the supplier of a screw that is used in the manufacture of various products manufactured by the cooperating parties CP, CP, CP, CP, CP, CP, and CP. In turn, the cooperating parties may produce products or product components that are needed by other cooperating parties independent of CP.","For example, CP may manufacture a cartridge for use in a printing machine produced by CP. The exemplary business process server computing application (not shown) may operate among the cooperating parties to facilitate one or more portions of a contemplated transaction between these cooperating parties. These portions may include but are not limited to the creation, management, and tracking of a purchase order for a screw (or a printing cartridge), the creation, management, and tracking of an invoice for shipped screws, and the creation, management, and tracking delivery reports. In the event that business process change needs to be integrated (e.g. an invoice has changed in form and substance) among cooperating parties, the business process server computing application employs a configuration management and configuration information communication\/deployment (CMCICD) tool to automatically integrate the change among the operating portions of the distributed business process server computing application. Stated differently, the business process server computing application (not shown) may operate among cooperating parties as a distributed computing application such that one or more portions of the business process server computing application operates local to each of the cooperating parties.",{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0043","num":"0042"},"figref":"FIG. 4","b":["1","1","1","1","420","1","1","2","2","3","3","2","2","430","3","3","440","2","2","2","3","410"]},"In operation, the business process server computing application manages information between the cooperating parties as required and defined by the relationships that exist between these cooperating parties. The business process server computing application is generally robust easily operating in disparate computing environments having disparate communication preferences. For example, if cooperating party  is a supplier and cooperating party  is a buyer, business process server computing application may create, manage, track, and store information pertinent to the sale and\/or purchase of goods between the supplier (cooperating part ) and the buyer (cooperating party ). The information that is created, managed, and tracked between the cooperating parties may be changed to respond to a change in business practice. For example if the seller chooses to report the sale of a good in a different way that requires a new invoice, the seller may employ the CMCICD tool (that too like the business process server computing application is robust to operate in disparate computing environments that have varying communication requirements\u2014moreover, the CMCICD tool facilitates the operation of the business process server computing application by providing a change environment management tool) operating in his\/her computing environment to propagate and deploy the change among the cooperating parties. The cooperating party initiating the change may notify the cooperating parties via the business process server computing application. Once notified, the cooperating parties may execute their CMCICD tool to select the package(s) (e.g. template information, schemas, implementation guidelines, and test data) in line with the desired change and execute the CMCICD tool to update the business process server application so that it performs the steps necessary to reflect the desired change. In the example provided, the buyer cooperating party  may employ the CMCICD tool operating on client computer CP client and cooperating with business process server computing application operating on computer server CP server to reconfigure the business process server computing application running on computer server CP to perform the functions and operations to coincide with the use of the new invoice offered by seller cooperating party .","Figure shows the processing performed to automatically update the configuration of one or more portions of an exemplary business process server computing application operating in a computing environment. As shown, processing begins at block  and proceeds to block  where a check is performed to determine if a configuration change is to be implemented. If there is no configuration change, processing reverts to block . However, if there is a configuration change, processing proceeds to block  where the configuration management and configuration information communication\/deployment (CMCICD) tool is initiated among cooperating parties. The cooperating party implementing the change then selects the desired packages (as described above) at block . Once the packages are selected, they are installed in the computing environment local to the cooperating party implementing the change. A closed loop test is then performed at block . Subsequently, a bouncer test to ensure the proper configuration of computing hardware is performed at block . A check is then made at block  by the exemplary business process server computing application to make sure that the test was successful. If the installation of the package (s) and the tests are not successful, processing proceeds to block  where the configuration is modified. From there processing reverts to block  and proceeds there from.","However, if at block  it is determined that the tests are successful, processing proceeds to block  where a transaction request is sent by the business process server computing application operating in the computing environment of the cooperating party implementing the change. A check is then performed at block  to determine if the request is accepted by other cooperating parties operating the business process server computing application. If the request has been accepted, processing proceeds to block  where the cooperating parties are configured according to the desired change. Transactions having the desired change may then be processed at block . From there processing terminates at block .","However, if at block  it is determined that the transaction request has not been accepted, processing proceeds to block  where the requesting party is notified (e.g. via e-mail) of the problem or problems in the request and suggests solutions to the problems. The suggested solutions may be created by the exemplary business process server computing application. The problem or problems are rectified at block  according to one or more of the suggestions and processing then reverts to block .","As mentioned above, while illustrative implementations of the systems and methods described herein have been described in connection with various computing devices and network architectures, the underlying concepts may be applied to any computing device or system in which it is desirable to perform and execute debugger causality.
