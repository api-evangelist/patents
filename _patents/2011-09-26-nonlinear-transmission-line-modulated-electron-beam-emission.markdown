abstract: A method to modulate the density of an electron beam as it is emitted from a cathode, the method comprised of connecting a source of pulsed input power to the input end of a nonlinear transmission line and connecting the output end directly to the cathode of an electron beam diode by a direct electrical connection.

In grid-controlled microwave tubes, such as inductive output tubes and planar triodes, this is done by applying a dc voltage between the cathode and anode of a vacuum diode and then using a control grid with a time varying voltage bias a very short distance (as little as \u02dc0.1 mm) from the cathode. The control grid bias determines the amount of current that is released from the cathode. The highest frequency of these tubes is limited by the electron transit time in the cathode to grid region. The requirement for a cathode control grid increases expense and complexity as well as introducing additional failure methods (such as inadvertent shorting of the cathode to the grid due to contaminates or warping of the grid or cathode).","In many accelerators, a modulated electron beam is created using laser light pulses to eject electrons from a photocathode. The laser system and associated focusing optics add considerable cost and complexity to accelerator cathodes.","This invention provides a novel and more efficient way to modulate the current density of an electron beam emitted from a cathode without the need for complicated control grids or laser-based photoemission techniques used in current microwave tubes and accelerators.","The present invention provides a novel and more efficient way to modulate the current density of an electron beam emitted from a cathode without the need for complicated control grids or laser-based photoemission techniques currently in use. The current density is modulated by coupling a vacuum diode to a nonlinear transmission line (NLTL). This connection may be made from the NLTL to the cathode or from the NLTL to the anode of the electron beam diode.","A dispersive NLTL can be used to convert a pulsed voltage input into a modulated output at microwave frequencies. A non-dispersive NLTL, or shockline, can be coupled to the cathode to produce an electron beam with a very sharp density gradient on the leading edge of the beam. Because the NLTL can be incorporated into the power system, this invention enables one to directly modulate the input voltage pulse to the cathode in a controllable and repeatable manner at high frequencies (>500 MHz) and provides a technique that is simpler, less expensive, and more robust than current methods.",{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0018","num":"0017"},"figref":"FIG. 1","b":["1","2","3","1","4","3","5","6","3","5","3","7","5","3","5","7","5","3","8"]},"The nonlinearity of the electromagnetic response of the nonlinear transmission line may be due to nonlinear dielectric materials, nonlinear magnetic materials, or a combination of nonlinear dielectric and nonlinear magnetic materials.
