The Government has certain rights in this invention.","The invention relates to power electronics, and in particular to optically-triggered power devices for power electronic systems.","Next-generation photonic power electronic systems based on optically-triggered devices (OTDs) provide key advantages over conventional electrically-triggered devices (ETD) based switching power systems. First, optical switching enhances the possibility of system integration by reducing the problems associated with electromagnetic-interference (EMI) effects. Second, for two- and higher-level electrically-triggered (ET) switching converters, different designs of low- and high-side drivers are required; the latter is especially difficult to design for medium and high-power applications. For an optically-triggered (OT) converter, the designs of high- and low-side drivers remain the same yielding simple design, enhanced reliability, and monolithic integration. Third, unlike an OTD, as the switching frequency of an ETD increases, parasitic oscillations may be induced in the driver circuit owing to coupling effects between the device capacitance and the parasitic inductance of the gate connection and also due to transmission-line effects. Fourth, in an OTD, there is complete isolation between the gate driver and the power stage. As such, very high di\/dt and dv\/dt, which cause significant reliability problems in an ETD at a high switch frequency, have no impact on an OTD. Therefore, the basic architecture of the gate driver in an OTD is simple. Fifth, an OTD based converter does not suffer from gate-driver failure due to short-circuiting.","Additionally, recent research has shown that tangible reductions in weight, volume, and cost are possible through an application of emerging photonic technologies for vehicle power management systems, such as those based on fly-by-light (FBL) architecture. An electrically isolated flight control mode based on photonic technology could provide a lightweight, electromagnetic interference (EMI) resistant system.","However, to realize such photonic power electronics, device technologies need to be developed that address the following key issues: i) wavelength of operation; ii) electrical gain; iii) switching speed; and iv) high-temperature operability. Short wavelength (<400 nm) requirements, necessary for wide-band gap materials, are incompatible with fiber-optic distribution of control signals due to strong absorption and dispersion losses. To reduce the power requirements, volume, and weight of the optical triggering source, high electrical (device) gain and quantum efficiency is desirable. A fast turn-on and turn-off of the OTD along with low on resistance is needed to efficiently support high-frequency repetitive switching in power electronics. A low-loss rapid switching capability also enhances the power density of the power system, which is desirable for most applications. Finally, high-temperature operability is often required to address the robustness of the power converter and high power density.","The light-triggered thyristors and optothyristors are two known examples of photoconductive power devices designed for power electronics. However, both of these devices feature the inherent thyristor like latch-up problem leading to uncontrollable and slow turn-off which is not desirable for a fast repetitive switching device. Moreover, vertical devices like optothyristor employ a semi-insulating thick layer instead of controllably doped layer. This results in large voltage drop across the device during conduction. For switching devices in power electronic applications, this drop is unacceptable from the efficiency point of view and the voltage-sustaining layer must be doped controllably so as to maintain an optimum balance between on-state conduction drop and off-state voltage blocking capability.","The present invention is directed to optically-triggered power systems and devices. The optically-triggered power system in accordance with one embodiment of the present invention includes a controller for generating electrical control signals, a converter for converting the electrical control signals to optical control signals and at least one power device being optically activated upon being exposed to a corresponding optical control signal from the converter.","The power device of the present invention includes a pair of terminals and a P-body region provided adjacent an N source region. An optical window is provided at least partially over the P-body region, and an N drift region is provided between the two terminals. The P-body region causes current to conduct between the first and second terminal through the N drift region when the optical control signal is incident on the optical window.","The invention is directed to photogeneration (generation of electron-hole pairs by shining light of suitable wavelength on a semiconductor) and recombination mechanism to trigger a power semiconductor device from off-state to on-state and vice versa without any electrical signal applied to its controlling gate terminal. This precludes the need to have an electrical gate terminal. As the photogeneration is an instantaneous process, an almost zero delay between the shining of light and initiation of device turn-on is resulted. The turn-off speed is primarily governed by the recombination lifetime of the photogenerated carriers.","Using primary device materials of very short lifetime such as GaAs, fast repetitive switching capability by reducing both turn-on and turn-off time is achieved. The advantages over the existing technology have been made possible by integrating optically active nature of a III-V compound semiconductor, e.g., GaAs, to P-N junction based power device structure and thus triggering a switching power semiconductor device through direct optical control using one or multiple optical source of monochromatic wavelength.","Turning now to , a direct optically-triggered power electronic system  in accordance with one embodiment of the present invention includes a controller  for outputting electrical control signals. A converter  receives the electrical control signals from the controller  and converts them into optical signals, i.e., light signals. The converter  includes a number of laser drivers  for generating the optical signals having the same or different wave lengths and same or different intensities. The optical signals from the converter  are then carried by optical waveguides  such as optical fibers  to optically-triggered power devices  which operate or trigger when the optical signals are received","In the preferred embodiment, the controller  is an electronic circuit which generates suitable timing signals for controlling the turn-on and turn-off of the power devices  in the power electronics system . It receives information on the electrical state of the power electronics system (e.g. voltage at different nodes, current through different branches of the circuit) through suitable sensors and processes that information to generate those control signals.","The converter  may be a semiconductor laser diode which accepts input electrical current signals and generate output light pulses accordingly. It may also be a light-emitting diode. It may also be a multi-stage device, for example, a solid-state laser system pumped by a laser diode. In this case, the laser diode accepts the input electrical signals, converts them to optical signals, which is fed to the solid-state laser. Solid-state laser then generates the final output optical signals. Nevertheless, the overall device takes input electrical signals and generates output optical signals following the input signals","Referring to , the optically-triggered power devices  and  includes two electrical terminals ,  attached respectively to a source region  and a drain region , and an optical window . The power devices  also include epitaxial layers of a P-type layer  of AlGaAs, an N-type layer  of GaAs and an N\u2014AlGaAs surface barrier layer  (in the optical window ) from the bottom respectively grown on top of semi-insulating GaAs substrate  (shown in ).","GaAs was chosen as the primary device material because of its direct bandgap nature, higher mobility, and fast photogeneration-recombination dynamics. The doping and thickness values of these layers have been chosen such as to realize the superjunction charge-balance, i.e., the total positive charge contributed by P-type layer  nullifies the total negative charge contributed by the N-type layers  on top of it. This ensures complete depletion of a drift region  formed by the GaAs N-type layer , and makes the breakdown voltage of the power devices ,  linearly dependent on the drift length L. In the blocking or open state, the applied voltage is supported by the reverse biased P-N junction between a P-body region  and the N-drift  region.","The source and the drain regions ,  below the terminals ,  are highly-doped areas. For the power device  such as an optically-triggered power transistor (OTPT) (), both are N-type, and for the power device  such as an optically-gated bipolar transistor (OGBT) (), the source region  is an N-type and the drain region  is a P-type. These regions ,  inject the carriers (electron and holes) into their respective power devices ,  from the circuit (not shown) through the electrical contacts, i.e., the terminals , .","The optical window , in the embodiment shown in , includes an anti-reflecting layer  between the electrodes, preferably made of suitable dielectric material, such as SiN, of particular thickness, e.g., approximately 100 nm thick, that result in minimum amount of reflection of light. The diffused P-body region  of the power device  is realized by a zinc diffusion method, and creates an almost parallel-plate like junction with the N-drift  region. The thin AlGaAs surface barrier layer  is used to suppress Fermi-pinning effects and surface recombination velocity effects which may degrade the overall device performance, lowering the optical triggering efficiency. The AlGaAs surface barrier layer , being transparent to the operating wavelength of the optical signals, does not cause photogeneration.","When triggering light  shines on the optical window , the conduction starts by photogeneration in the P-body region . For the power device  such as the OTPT shown in , the optical window  spreads over the drift length Lbetween the drain and source regions , , and photogenerated carriers electrically connects the terminals  and  via a conducting channel . When the triggering light  shuts off, photogenerated carriers recombine and the channel  ceases to turn the power device  off.","For the power device  such the OGBT shown in , the optical window  only covers the region around the P-body region  and photogenerated electrons  act as the base current for the lateral P-N-P transistor  to turn the device on. The forward biased P-N junction on the drain region  side of the power device  injects holes  into the drift region  that modulates its conductivity and start current conduction, i.e., the holes  starts a process called \u201coptically-initiated conductivity modulation.\u201d When the light shuts off, the base current to the P-N-P transistor ceases due to recombination and the power device  turns off.","This additional carrier injection by the P-N-P transistor  helps to achieve gain for the OGBT type power device . The optical window  needs to cover only the P-body region  to create a photogenerated channel to supply electrons. This is unlike the OTPT type power device  where direct photogenerated carriers help to build the device current without any additional electrical gain. This makes OTPT turn-on very fast, limited only by laser driver  (shown in ) trigger rise time. For the OGBT type power device , the hole injection from the P drain region  build up the primary device current but that introduces a delay and the turn-on becomes slower. Turn-off for both the devices is limited by the recombination lifetime which is around approximately 1-10 ns for moderately doped GaAs.",{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0032","num":"0031"},"figref":["FIG. 4","FIG. 5"],"b":"21","sub":["drift ","drift "]},{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0033","num":"0032"},"figref":"FIGS. 6 and 7","b":["20","21","20","21"]},"Superjunction charge-balance in the OTPT type power device , for example, ensures flat electric field in the completely depleted drift region  (see ) at the instant of breakdown. This enhances the breakdown voltage for same active device area and thus keeps specific on-state resistance low. Following charge-balance condition needs to be satisfied for the highest breakdown voltage,\n\n\u2003\u2003(1)\n","If the superjunction condition is satisfied by controlling the thickness and doping density of the epitaxial layers, then the breakdown voltage becomes almost independent of GaAs layer doping. Also the breakdown voltage becomes a linear function of the length of the drift region  () and can be extended indefinitely by increasing the drift length. Deviation from the optimum condition, however, may result in a decrease in the breakdown voltage. Sensitivity studies show that the decrease in breakdown voltage varies with the percentage charge-imbalance. Positive (negative) imbalance denotes more P (N)-type charge than N (P)-type charge.","For commercial vertical power MOSFETs, the relation between Vand R, i.e., the \u201csilicon limit\u201d, is given by\n\nR\u221dV\u2003\u2003(2)\n\nFor OTPT, for example, physics-based analyses yield two transcendental equations, which couple Vand Rthrough the common quantity L.

Because of the coupling between equations (3) and (4) and dependence of Ron G(which is a function of P), the Rvs. Vcurve can be modulated with varying P. This modulation is unique to direct optically-controlled power devices like OTPT and has no analogue in ETDs. While equations (4) and (5) have been derived with respect to the OTPT type power device , it should be understood that these equations can be similarly derived for any lateral structure power devices including the OGBT type power device . The lateral structure as used herein is a power device structure in which current flows laterally between the two terminals  and , i.e., parallel to the junction formed between the P-type GaAs layer  and the N-type GaAs layer .","Turning now to , a power device  in accordance with another embodiment of the present invention includes two electrical terminals ,  attached respectively to a source region  and a drain region , and an optical window . The power device  has a vertical structure in which current flows vertically between the two terminals, which are provided at the opposite sides of the power device, in contrast to power devices ,  that have the terminals  and  on the same side.","As with the lateral structure power devices , , the optical window  also includes an N\u2014AlGaAs surface barrier layer  provided substantially over an N-drift region  and a diffused P-body region . A an anti-reflecting layer , preferably of SiN and approximately 100 nm thick, is provided over the N\u2014AlGaAs layer  to minimize reflection of light incident on the anti-reflecting layer . The thickness of the anti-reflecting layer  may change depending on the optical signal wavelength and the material of at least the surface barrier layer .","The N-drift region  is provided in an epitaxial layer of GaAs  extending from the N\u2014AlGaAs surface barrier layer  of the optical window  to the drain region . The diffused P-body region  is provided between the source region  and the GaAs layer , and is realized by a zinc diffusion method. The N\u2014AlGaAs surface barrier layer  is used to suppress Fermi-pinning effects and surface recombination velocity effects which may degrade the overall device performance, lowering the optical triggering efficiency. The surface barrier layer , being transparent to the operating wavelength of the opertical signals, does not cause photogeneration.","When triggering light  shines on the optical window , electron-hole pairs are created by photogeneration in the P-body region . Photogenerated electrons form a channel through the P-body region  and connect the source region  conductively to the drain region , thereby starting a current flow between the drain region and the source region through the N drift region . This places the power device  in an on-state. Majority of the photogenerated holes diffuse to the N source region  and get recombined with excess electrons there. Some carriers undergo surface recombination also. When the triggering light  is removed, the electrons in the P-body region  gets recombined rapidly with the excess holes in the P-body region. The channel ceases to exist in the P-body region  and the device goes back to the off-state.","The vertical structure power device , shown in , generally exhibits a higher gain, i.e. device current per unit photogenerated current compared to its lateral equivalent, shown in . This is because the effective optical window area in the vertical structure is only A, =ZL, where Z is the width of the device in the Z-dimension (along the line perpendicular to the plane of the paper) and Lis the channel length. In the lateral structure, the window area is A=Z(L+L), where Lis the drift region length.","On the other hand, lateral structure offers parallel-plate like P-N junction, which is theoretically a good junction profile to support reverse bias, and ease of implementing superjunction (SJ) charge-balancing (by maintaining precise relation between the depth (d, and d) and doping densities (NI, and N) of GaAs and AlGaAs layers by one-step epitaxial growth. This charge-balance ensures that the full drift region remains depleted regardless of its doping level and results in high breakdown voltage which is linearly dependent on drift region length but independent of drift doping density. The SJ structure has been demonstrated to help power device achieve higher breakdown voltage for same on-state resistance.","While the vertical structure power device  has been described with respect to GaAs as the primary material, other materials such as silicon carbide (SiC) and Indium Nitride (InN) may also be used in the vertical structure power devices. For example, the bandgap of InGaN can be tailored to any value between 0.7 eV (that of pure InN) and 3.2 eV (that of pure GaN) by varying indium content. At x=0.55, the bandgap corresponding to 800-850 nm wavelength is obtained. For pure InN, 0.7-0.8 eV is obtained, which corresponds to approximately 1.55 \u03bcm wavelength, the primary niche of optical communication.","Examples of the vertical structure power devices having other primary materials are shown in .

Specific illustrations of device structures for this embodiment are shown in .","In the second embodiment, shown in , the MPD receives one optical control signal (S) for turn-on and turn-off (as same as the first embodiment) through a first optical window and a second optical signal (S) through another optical window. The second signal does not take part in actively controlling the device conduction state but is used to dynamically modulate its electrical performance parameters such as on-state resistance or turn-on and turn-off time. For example, the second light could be of different wavelength to excite certain trap-centers in the bandgap of the material, used to fabricate the device, which modulates the recombination lifetime of the material. This results in significant changes in the device optical gain, on-state resistance and switching speed (especially turn-off time). Another way, the second optical signal can modulate the potential barrier of a particular P-N junction present in the device structure to alter device on-state resistance or optical gain. The signals Sand Scan differ in intensity and\/or wavelength.","In the third embodiment (), the overall device comprises of, apart from the MPD, a secondary optical amplifier structure which is optically coupled to the main power device. The function of this amplifier is to receive a low-intensity optical signal and amplify it to feed to the main power device. This way, a low optical power source (LED or low-power laser) may be used to trigger the device thereby reducing the overall power electronic system cost and driver complexity.","In the fourth embodiment (), the overall device comprises of, apart from the MPD, a secondary wavelength converter structure which is optically coupled to the main power device. The function of this amplifier is to receive an optical signal of a certain wavelength and convert it to an optical signal of different wavelength to feed to the main power device. This way, an optical source of industry-standard wavelength range (800-850 nm or 1350-1550 nm) can be used to directly control MPD made of wide bandgap device like SiC, GaN eliminating the need to have expensive and complex short wavelength (300-400 nm) optical sources.","This embodiment is different from the device structures shown in , ,  etc. Those are device structure comprising wide bandgap material and a smaller bandgap material to enable the device to be triggered by a long wavelength signal. The device, due to the presence of smaller bandgap material, absorbs long wavelength light. But the fourth embodiment converts the incoming optical signal to a short wavelength and the MPD absorbs the short wavelength light.","While specific embodiments of the present invention have been shown and described, it should be understood that other modifications, substitutions and alternatives are apparent to one of ordinary skill in the art.
