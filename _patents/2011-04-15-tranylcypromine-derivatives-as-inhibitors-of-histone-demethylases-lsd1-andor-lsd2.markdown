BIOLOGICAL TESTING"],"p":["This application is a 371 of PCT\/EP2011\/055990, filed Apr. 15, 2011, which claims the benefit of U.S. Provisional Patent Application No. 61\/325,952, filed Apr. 20, 2010, the contents of each of which are incorporated herein by reference.","The present invention relates to tranylcypromine derivatives and to their use as therapeutic agents, particularly for the prevention and\/or treatment of diseases and conditions associated with the activity of histone demethylases LSD1 and LSD2, such as the diseases characterized by deregulation of gene transcription, cell differentiation and proliferation, e.g. tumors, viral infections. The invention also relates to the preparation of these compounds, as well as to compositions containing them and to therapeutic use thereof.","Alterations in the structural and functional states of chromatin are involved in the pathogenesis of a variety of diseases. The biochemical and enzymatic processes that catalyze the insertion and elimination of the post-translational modifications on the nucleosomes have become the subject of research as potential targets for the so-called epigenetic therapies (Urdinguio R G, Sanchez-Mut J V, Esteller M. Epigenetic mechanisms in neurological diseases: genes, syndromes, and therapies. 8:1056-1072, 2009). The discovery of an increasing number of histone demethylases has highlighted the dynamic nature of the regulation of histone methylation, a key chromatin modification that is involved in eukaryotic genome and gene regulation. Histone lysine demethylases represent very attractive targets for epigenetic drugs and are gaining increasing attention. A lysine can be mono-, di-, and tri-methylated. Each modification on the same amino acid can specifically exert different biological effects. The recent discovery of histone lysine demethylases has revealed two types of enzymatic mechanisms (Anand R, Marmorstein R. Structure and mechanism of lysine-specific demethylase enzymes. 282:35425-35429, 2007). The iron-dependent enzymes can demethylate lysine side chains in all three methylation states and many demethylases in this family have now been characterized. Conversely, the oxidative chemistry that underlies the function of flavin-dependent histone demethylases makes it impossible for these enzymes to act on a trimethylated lysine and restricts their activity to mono- and di-methylated substrates. Mammals contain two flavoenzyme demethylases: LSD1 and LSD2. LSD1 was the first discovered histone demethylase and is typically (but not always) associated with the co-repressor protein CoREST. LSD1\/CoREST can associate to histone deacetylases 1\/2 (HDAC1\/2) forming a multienzyme unit that is recruited by many chromatin complexes that are typically involved in gene repression regulation (Ballas N, et al. Regulation of neuronal traits by a novel transcriptional complex. 31:353-365, 2001). LSD1 erases the methyl groups from mono- and di-methyl Lys4 of histone H3, which is a well-characterized gene activation mark. The enzyme is an interesting target for epigenetic drugs as suggested by its overexpression in solid tumors (Schulte J H, et al. Lysine-specific demethylase 1 is strongly expressed in poorly differentiated neuroblastoma: implications for therapy. 69:2065-2071, 2009), its role in various differentiation processes (Hu X, et al. LSD1-mediated epigenetic modification is required for TAL1 function and hematopoiesis. 106:10141-10146, 2009), its involvement in herpes virus infection (Gu H, Roizman B. Engagement of the lysine-specific demethylase\/HDAC1\/CoREST\/REST complex by herpes simplex virus 1. 83:4376-4385, 2009), and its association to HDAC1, a validated drug-target. LSD2 is a more recently discovered demethylase which, like LSD1, displays a strict specificity for mono- and di-methylated Lys4 of H3. However, the biology of LSD2, which remains only partly characterized, proposed to differ from that of LSD1 since LSD2 does not bind CoREST and it has not been found so-far in any LSD1-containing protein complex (Karytinos A, et al. A novel mammalian flavin-dependent histone demethylase. 284:17775-17782, 2009).","LSD1 and LSD2 are multi-domain proteins which share a similar catalytic domain (45% sequence identity) that is structurally homologous with the monoamine oxidases (MAOs) A and B. Tranylcypromine, (\u00b1)-trans-2-phenylcyclopropyl-1-amine (tPCPA), a MAO inhibitor used as antidepressive drug, is also able to inhibit LSD1 (Schmidt D M, McCafferty D G. trans-2-Phenylcyclopropylamine is a mechanism-based inactivator of the histone demethylase LSD1. 46:4408-4416, 2007).",{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0007","num":"0005"},"chemistry":{"@attributes":{"id":"CHEM-US-00002","num":"00002"},"img":{"@attributes":{"id":"EMI-C00002","he":"21.34mm","wi":"28.96mm","file":"US08765820-20140701-C00002.TIF","alt":"embedded image","img-content":"chem","img-format":"tif"}}}},"Gooden et at (18, 3047-3051, 2008) describes a synthetic route to substituted trans-2-arylcyclopropylamines as inhibitors of LSD1 and MAOs.

None of disclosed compounds are within the instant invention.","Hence there is a need to identify small molecules as potent and selective inhibitors of the LSD1 and\/or LSD2 histone demethylase, which are useful in the prevention or therapy of diseases and conditions associated with the activity of the histone demethylases.","The compounds of the present invention are small molecules endowed with potent histone demethylases inhibitory activity, which are useful in the treatment of a variety of diseases in which deregulation of gene transcription, cell differentiation and proliferation is observed, e.g. tumors, viral infections.","The present invention is directed towards compounds that are endowed with LSD1 and\/or LSD2 histone demethylases inhibiting activity and are useful in the prevention or therapy of diseases and conditions associated with the activity of the LSD1 and\/or LSD2 histone demethylases.

In case the acylating agent or the Z-protected aminoacid bears reactive groups like hydroxyl, carboxyl, thiol or amino groups, they may need to be protected by protecting groups such as t-butoxycarbonyl, benzyl, benzyloxycarbonyl, methyl, trimethylsilyl and similar and, at a certain step of the synthesis, deprotected to obtain again the free reactive group.

In particular, ethyl 2-(4-nitrophenyl)cyclopropyl-1carboxylate was obtained as a mixture of cis and trans by coupling of commercially available 4-nitrostyrene with ethyl diazoacetate (EDA), in the presence of copper (I) chloride (CuCl) in dry CHCl(Scheme 1). The two isomers can be isolated by using known procedures for the separation of compounds, for example by chromatographic separation, recrystallization techniques, as well as other methods well known to the person skilled in the art. Alkaline hydrolysis of the ethyl ester furnished the corresponding carboxylic acids, which were in turn converted into the related t-butoxy carbamates through reaction with trietylamine, diphenylphosphoryl azide, t-butanol, and di-t-butyldicarbonate in dry benzene. Reduction of the nitro group of these last compounds with sodium hypophosphite, palladium on carbon, and potassium carbonate gave the compounds of formula (II).",{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0093","num":"0097"},"chemistry":{"@attributes":{"id":"CHEM-US-00036","num":"00036"},"img":{"@attributes":{"id":"EMI-C00036","he":"140.55mm","wi":"131.49mm","file":"US08765820-20140701-C00036.TIF","alt":"embedded image","img-content":"chem","img-format":"tif"}}}},"The compounds of the present invention were found to be effective LSD1 and LSD2 inhibitors and exhibit anti-tumor activity on leukemic cells when taken alone, and synergistic activities with anti-leukemia drugs when given in combination.","It is an object of the present invention a compound of formula I being an inhibitor of LSD1 and\/or LSD2 histone demethylase.","Preferably, the compound of the invention is for use in therapy or as pro-apoptotic agent, still preferably the compound is for use as a medicament for the prevention and\/or treatment of diseases characterized by deregulation of gene transcription, cell differentiation and proliferation.","In a preferred embodiment, the compound of the invention is for use as an anti-tumoral agent.","In a further preferred embodiment, the compound is for use as an anti-viral agent.","It is an object of the invention a method for preventing and\/or treating diseases and conditions associated with the activity of histone demethylase LSD1 and\/or LSD2, in particular tumors, viral infections, by administering to a mammal in need of such treatment a therapeutically effective amount of a compound of general formula (I) as defined above.","Preferably, the tumor is selected from: neuroblastoma, prostate cancer, breast cancer, acute myeloid leukemia, T-lineage acute lymphoblastic leukemia, bladder cancer, lung cancer and colorectal cancer.","Still preferably, the viral infection is caused by Herpes Simplex Virus.","It is an object of the invention a pharmaceutical composition comprising one or more compounds of general formula (I), as defined above, alone or in combination with other active compounds, and at least one pharmaceutically acceptable excipient.","Preferably, the pharmaceutical composition comprises an effective amount of the compound of the invention formulated in unit dosage form.","The term \u201cexcipient\u201d herein means any substance, not itself a therapeutic agent, used as a carrier or vehicle for delivery of a therapeutic agent to a subject or added to a pharmaceutical composition to improve its handling or storage properties or to permit or facilitate formation of a dose unit of the composition into a discrete article such as a tablet, capsule, pill, powder, granule, pellet, lozenge, pastille, elixir, syrup, solution, suspension, emulsion, drop, lotion, spray, tincture, cream, ointment, gel, unguent, suppository and transdermal devices for oral, enteral, parenteral or topical administrations.","The term \u201cunit dosage forms\u201d refers to physically discrete units suitable as unitary dosages for human subjects and other mammals, each unit containing a predetermined quantity of active material calculated to produce the desired therapeutic effect, in association with a suitable pharmaceutical excipient.","A person skilled in the art is aware of a whole variety of such excipients suitable to formulate a pharmaceutical composition. Suitable pharmaceutically acceptable excipients are well known to those skilled in the art. Excipients include, by way of illustration and not limitation, diluents, solubilizers, fillers, agglutinants, disintegrants, disintegration inhibitors, absorption accelerators, adjuvant, binders, carriers, suspensing\/dispersing agents, film formers\/coatings, adhesives, antiadherents, wetting agents, lubricants, glidants, preservatives, sorbents, buffering agents, surface active agents, substances added to mask or counteract a disagreeable taste or odor, flavorings, colorants, fragrances, aromatising agents, sweeteners, substances added to improve appearance of the composition, and the like. The choice of excipient will to a large extent depend on factors such as the particular mode of administration, the effect of the excipient on solubility and stability, and the nature of the dosage form.","The pharmaceutical compositions of the present invention can be administered by a variety of routes including oral, parenteral, intravenous, by infusion, subcutaneous, intramuscular, intraperitoneal, transmucosal (including buccal, sublingual, nasal, transurethral and rectal), topical, transdermal, by inhalation, ocular routes (including ocular implants, reservoir implants and injectable therapies such as intravitreal administration), permucous or percutaneous or using any other route of administration.","They will thus be presented in the form of solids or liquids, injectable solutions or suspensions or multi-dose bottles, in the form tablets, plain or coated tablets, sugar or film coated tablets, capsules, wafer capsules, gel capsules, pills, cachets, sachets, powders, granules, caplets, lozenges, bolus, dragees, electuary, past, suppositories or rectal capsules, syrups, elixirs, emulsions, solutions, suspensions, creams, ointments, liniments, lotions, drops, sprays, patches, for percutaneous use in a polar solvent, or for permucous use.","For example, the solid oral forms may contain, together with the active compound, diluents, e.g., alkaline-earth metal carbonates, magnesium phosphate, lactose, dextrose, saccharose, sucrose, cellulose, microcrystalline cellulose derivatives, starches, corn starch or potato starch, modified starches and the like; lubricants, e.g., silica, talc, stearic acid, magnesium or calcium stearate, and\/or polyethylene glycols; binding agents, e.g., starches, arabic gum, gelatine methylcellulose, carboxymethylcellulose or polyvinyl pyrrolidone; disintegrating agents, e.g., starch, alginic acid, alginates or sodium starch glycolate; effervescing mixtures; dyestuffs; sweeteners; wetting agents, such as lecithin, polysorbates, laurylsulphates; and, in general, non-toxic and pharmacologically inactive substances used in pharmaceutical formulations. These pharmaceutical preparations may be manufactured in known manner, for example, by means of mixing, granulating, tabletting, sugar-coating, or film-coating processes.","The liquid dispersions for oral administration may be, e.g., syrups, emulsions and suspensions. As an example the syrups may contain, as a carrier, saccharose or saccharose with glycerine and\/or mannitol and sorbitol.","The suspensions and the emulsions may contain, as examples of carriers, natural gum, agar, sodium alginate, pectin, methylcellulose, carboxymethylcellulose, or polyvinyl alcohol.","The suspension or solutions for intramuscular injections may contain, together with the active compound, a pharmaceutically acceptable carrier, e.g., sterile water, olive oil, ethyl oleate, glycols, e.g., propylene glycol and, if desired, a suitable amount of lidocaine hydrochloride.","The solutions for intravenous injections or infusions may contain, as a carrier, sterile water or preferably they may be in the form of sterile, aqueous, isotonic, saline solutions or they may contain propylene glycol as a carrier.","The suppositories may contain, together with the active compound, a pharmaceutically acceptable carrier, e.g., cocoa butter, polyethylene glycols, a polyoxyethylene sorbitan fatty acid ester surfactants, salicylates or lecithin.","The inhalation aerosols may contain, together with the active compound, propellant gas, such as hydrofluoroalkanes. The propellant-driven formulations may also contain other ingredients such as co-solvents, stabilizers and optionally other excipients. The propellant-free inhalable formulations comprising the compounds of the invention may be in form of solutions or suspensions in an aqueous, alcoholic or hydroalcoholic medium and they may be delivered by jet or ultrasonic nebulizers known from the prior art or by soft-mist nebulizers.","The above described components for pharmaceutical composition administered are merely representative. Further materials as well as processing techniques and the like are set out in Part 5 of Remington's Pharmaceutical Sciences, 20Edition, 2000, Merck Publishing Company, Easton, Pa., which is incorporated herein by reference. Compound of this invention of formula (I) can also be administered in sustained release forms or from sustained release drug delivery systems. A description of representative sustained release materials can also be found in the incorporated materials in Remington's Pharmaceutical Sciences.","The pharmaceutical compositions containing the compounds of the invention are usually prepared following conventional methods and are administered in a suitable pharmaceutical form.","Solid oral compositions can be prepared by conventional mixing, filling or compression. It is possible to repeat the mixing operations in order to disperse the active agent in compositions containing high amounts of fillers. These operations are conventional.","Liquid oral preparations can be formulated e.g. as aqueous or oily suspensions or solutions, emulsions, syrups or elixir, or can be presented as freeze dried product to be regenerated by addition of water or a suitable vehicle before use. Said liquid preparations can contain conventional additives such as suspending agents, e.g. sorbitol, syrup, methylcellulose, gelatine, hydroxyethylcellulose, carboxymethylcellulose, alluminium stearate gel or hydrogenated edible fats, emulsifying agents, e.g. lecithin, sorbitan monooleate, or acacia; non-aqueous vehicles (which may include edible oils), e.g. almond oil, fractionated coconut oil, oily esters such as glycerin esters, propylene glycol, or ethyl alcohol; preservatives, e.g. methyl or propyl p-hydroxybenzoate or sorbic acid and, if desired, conventional flavours and dyes.","For parenteral administration, it is possible to prepare fluid dosage units, containing the compound and a sterile vehicle. The compound, depending on the chosen vehicle and concentration, can be suspended or dissolved. Parenteral solutions are normally prepared by dissolving the compound in a vehicle, sterilizing by filtration, filling suitable vials and sealing. Advantageously it is also possible to dissolve in the vehicle suitable adjuvants such as local anesthetic, preservatives and buffering agents. In order to increase stability, the composition can be frozen after filling the vial and removing water under vacuum. Parenteral suspensions are prepared substantially in the same way, with the difference that the compound can be suspended rather than dissolved in the vehicle, and they can be sterilized by treatment with ethylene oxide before being suspended in the sterile vehicle. Advantageously, it is possible to include a surfactant or a wetting agent in the composition with the aim of easing the uniform distribution of the compound of the invention.","The compounds of the invention can also be administered topically. Topical formulations may comprise, for example, an ointment, cream, gel, lotion, solution, paste or the like, and\/or may be prepared so as to contain liposomes, micelles, and\/or microspheres. Ointments, as it is well known in the art of pharmaceutical formulation, are semisolid preparations that are typically based on petrolatum or other petroleum derivatives. Examples of ointments include oleaginous ointment bases, for example, vegetable oils, fats obtained from animals, and semisolid hydrocarbons obtained from petroleum, emulsifiable ointment bases, for example, hydroxystearin sulfate, anhydrous lanolin and hydrophilic petrolatum, emulsion ointment bases, for example, cetyl alcohol, glyceryl monostearate, lanolin and stearic acid and water-soluble ointment bases prepared from polyethylene glycols of varying molecular weight. Creams, as also well known to those skilled in the art, are viscous liquids or semisolid emulsions, and contain an oil phase, an emulsifier and an aqueous phase. The oil phase is generally comprised of petrolatum and a fatty alcohol such as cetyl or stearyl alcohol. The aqueous phase usually contains a humectant. The emulsifier in a cream formulation is chosen among non-ionic, anionic, cationic or amphoteric surfactants. Single-phase gels contain organic macromolecules distributed substantially uniformly throughout the carrier liquid, which is typically aqueous, but also, preferably, contain an alcohol and, optionally, an oil. Preferred gelling agents are crosslinked acrylic acid polymers (such as \u201ccarbomer\u201d polymers, e. g., carboxypolyalkylenes that may be obtained commercially under the Carbopol trademark). Also preferred are hydrophilic polymers such as polyethylene oxides, polyoxyethylene-polyoxypropylene copolymers and polyvinylalcohol; cellulosic polymers such as hydroxypropyl cellulose, hydroxyethyl cellulose, hydroxypropyl methylcellulose, hydroxypropyl methylcellulose phthalate, and methylcellulose; gums such as tragacanth and xanthan gum; sodium alginate; and gelatin. For the preparation of uniform gels, dispersing agents such as alcohol or glycerin can be added, or the gelling agent can be dispersed by trituration, mechanical mixing, and\/or stirring.","The compounds of the invention may also be administered via transdermal release. Typical transdermal formulations include conventional aqueous and non aqueous vectors, such as creams, oils, lotions or pastes or can be provided as membranes or medicated plasters. In an embodiment, a compound of the invention is dispersed in a pressure-sensible plaster adhering to the skin. This formulation allows the compound to be spread from the plaster to the patient through the skin. In order to obtain a sustained drug release through the cutis, natural rubber and silicon can be used as pressure-sensitive adhesives.","The compounds of formula (I) of the present invention, suitable for administration to a mammal, e.g., to humans, can be administered as the sole active agent or in combination with other pharmaceutical active ingredients by the usual routes and the dosage level depends on a variety of factors including the activity of the specific compound employed; the age, body weight, general health, sex and diet of the individual being treated; the time and route of administration; the rate of excretion; other drugs which have previously been administered; and the severity of the particular disease undergoing therapy, as is well understood by those skilled in the art.","For example, a suitable dosage adopted for oral administration of a compound of formula (I) may range from about 30 to 500 mg per dose, from 1 to 5 times daily. In general lower doses will be administered when a parental route is employed. Thus, for example, for intravenous administration a dose in the range, for example, 0.5 mg to 30 mg per kg body weight will be generally used.","The compounds of the invention can be administered in a variety of dosage forms, e.g., orally, in the form of tablets, sugar or film coated tablets, capsules, cachets, as a powder or granules; as a syrups, emulsions, solution or a suspension in an aqueous or non-aqueous liquid, as an oil-in-water liquid emulsion or a water-in-oil liquid emulsion, as a bolus, electuary or paste; rectally, in the form of suppositories; parenterally, e.g., intramuscularly, or through intravenous injection or infusion. Preferably, the compounds of general formula (I) alone or combined with other active ingredients may be administered for the prevention and\/or treatment of any disease wherein histone demethylases LSD1 and LSD2 inhibition is required. Said diseases include tumors, viral infections.","Unless otherwise indicated, all the starting reagents were found to be commercially available or easily obtainable following literature procedures, and were used without any purification. All solvents were reagent grade and, when necessary, were purified and dried by standard methods. Concentration of solutions after reactions and extractions involved the use of a rotary evaporator operating at reduced pressure of ca. 20 Torr. Organic solutions were dried over anhydrous sodium sulfate. Analytical results are within \u00b10.40% of the theoretical values.","TLC was performed on aluminum-backed silica gel plates (Merck DC, Alufolien Kieselgel 60 F254) with spots visualized by UV light.","The H NMR and C NMR spectra were acquired with a Bruker 400 MHz.
