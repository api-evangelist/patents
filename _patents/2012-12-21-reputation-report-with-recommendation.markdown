Unfortunately, the search results may be inaccurate or provide an incomplete picture of the second person. The first person may make important and potentially erroneous decisions about the second person based on the search results.","The invention can be implemented in numerous ways, including as a process; an apparatus; a system; a composition of matter; a computer program product embodied on a computer readable storage medium; and\/or a processor, such as a processor configured to execute instructions stored on and\/or provided by a memory coupled to the processor. In this specification, these implementations, or any other form that the invention may take, may be referred to as techniques. In general, the order of the steps of disclosed processes may be altered within the scope of the invention. Unless stated otherwise, a component such as a processor or a memory described as being configured to perform a task may be implemented as a general component that is temporarily configured to perform the task at a given time or a specific component that is manufactured to perform the task. As used herein, the term \u2018processor\u2019 refers to one or more devices, circuits, and\/or processing cores configured to process data, such as computer program instructions.","A detailed description of one or more embodiments of the invention is provided below along with accompanying figures that illustrate the principles of the invention. The invention is described in connection with such embodiments, but the invention is not limited to any embodiment. The scope of the invention is limited only by the claims and the invention encompasses numerous alternatives, modifications and equivalents. Numerous specific details are set forth in the following description in order to provide a thorough understanding of the invention. These details are provided for the purpose of example and the invention may be practiced according to the claims without some or all of these specific details.

As shown, such sources include search engines -, blog server , and social networking site , other sources can also be used, such as news sites, people search sites. Data can include text (in various formats) as well as image or other applicable types of information. Reputation report platform  can obtain the data from sources - in a variety of ways, including by scraping publicly available information, by using one or more Application Programming Interfaces (APIs), and\/or by using authorization\/credentials provided by individuals such as Alice and Bob. As one example of the latter case, Bob may have an account on social networking site  but have privacy settings on his profile that limit the profile's visibility to the public. Bob can provide credentials or other authorization to reputation report platform  so that platform  can access Bob's profile, and also, potentially, view other information on site  that would be visible to Bob when logged into the site but not otherwise visible to platform .",{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0015","num":"0014"},"figref":["FIG. 2","FIG. 2"],"b":["102","202","204","206","208","102","102","102","102","102"]},"Generating a Reputation Report",{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0017","num":"0016"},"figref":"FIG. 3","b":["300","102","302","102","104","102","102","302","210","302","102"]},"At , documents potentially associated with the individual whose reputation report has been requested are retrieved. As one example, after receiving Alice's request at , report coordinator  instructs search module  to perform a search via search engine  for documents pertaining to Alice (e.g., by instructing search module  to perform a search for \u201cAlice Smith\u201d). In some embodiments, prior to the commencement of process , Alice has registered for an account on platform  and has filled out profile information (e.g., listing her full name as \u201cAlice Smith.\u201d) In other embodiments, process  commences when Alice types her full name into an interface provided by platform , irrespective of whether Alice has signed up for an account.","The results returned by search engine  are an example of documents retrieved at . Portion  of the process can be performed in a variety of manners, and can be performed before and\/or after the processing performed at . For example, in some embodiments search module  queries multiple sources (e.g. search engines  and ) regarding Alice. Search module  can also be configured to query different types of sources (e.g. search engines and social networking sites). Search results can be obtained and stored (e.g., in storage ), in which case at least some documents retrieved at  are retrieved from storage  rather than a service such as search engine .","At , a set of codings for at least some of the documents retrieved at  is performed. In some embodiments, Alice is asked to code at least some of the documents. An interface for performing the coding is shown in . As will be explained in more detail below, examples of codings include \u201cthis document does not pertain to me,\u201d and \u201cthis is negative information about me.\u201d In some embodiments, a default coding of \u201cneutral\u201d is employed. Also as will be explained in more detail below, the codings can be multi-dimensional. For example, a newspaper article describing Alice's volunteer work at a local animal shelter can be coded as a \u201cpositive\u201d document from a \u201ctrustworthy\u201d source, while a social networking rant by a former boyfriend can be coded as a \u201cnegative\u201d document pertaining to her \u201cromantic life.\u201d Also, as explained above, a third party can use the interface shown in  on Alice's behalf.","In some embodiments, the documents are at least partially coded by platform . For example, a classifier  can be employed to determine a preliminary coding of at least some of the documents, and Alice can optionally be asked to confirm or adjust the preliminary coding. As one example, classifier  can use sentiment analysis techniques to determine whether a document is positive or negative. As another example, classifier  can be configured to use the domain from which a result is retrieved to impute a coding. For example, classifier  can be configured with a list of \u201cpositive\u201d sites and \u201cnegative\u201d sites, such that if an individual's name appears on a charitable organization's page (i.e. \u201cpositive\u201d) the result can be automatically coded as positive and if it appears on a sex-offender registry site (i.e. \u201cnegative\u201d) the result can be automatically coded as negative. As yet another example, classifier  can be configured to automatically code domains as \u201ctrustworthy\u201d or not (or neutral) based on a predefined list, or based on other information, such as a site's Page Rank. As yet another example, classifier  can be configured to automatically code results as \u201ccredible\u201d or not based on their age. For example, an article that has been available online for a long period of time can be treated as more credible than one that was recently added. Classifier 's coding can also be used without confirmation from Alice. As another example, platform  can be configured to use a service such as Amazon's Mechanical Turk to perform coding and\/or preliminary coding.","At , a reputation assessment is made by assessor  based at least in part on the coded documents, and at , a report is generated. An example of a reputation report is shown in . In some embodiments, the report includes recommendations, such as recommendations for improving one's online reputation. The report can also include one or more reputation scores, discussed in more detail below.",{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0023","num":"0022"},"figref":"FIG. 4","b":["400","400","306","300","212"]},"The first result () is about a different Alice Smith, so Alice selects \u201cThis is not me\u201d from dropdown . Name confusion can cause the reputations of others (i.e., other Alice Smiths) to impact Alice's reputation. The second result () is a positive news article about Alice, so she selects \u201cPositive\u201d from dropdown . The third result () is a third party website page that reveals Alice's telephone number, so she selects \u201cPrivate Info Exposed\u201d from dropdown . Other examples of labels Alice can use to code documents include \u201cNegative\u201d (indicating that the document says harmful things about Alice) and \u201cWorth Monitoring\u201d (indicating that the document is worth monitoring to make sure it does not become an issue in the future). Also included for each result presented in interface  is a checkbox (e.g. ) that allows Alice to indicate whether she controls the content. For example, if a result displayed in interface  is from Alice's personal blog (e.g. hosted on server ) or her profile on a social networking site (e.g., site ), Alice would check the checkbox adjacent to that result. If the result displayed was authored by someone else (e.g. appearing in a newspaper), Alice would not check the checkbox. In some embodiments, whether or not Alice controls a result is determined by platform . For example, if the result is Alice's profile on a social networking site, platform  can automatically conclude that Alice is able to modify the result.","As mentioned above, in some embodiments, platform  supports multi-dimensional coding. Using result  as an example, an example of a multi-dimensional coding is \u201cPositive\u201d and \u201cTrustworthy.\u201d The second dimension (trustworthy) indicates that the source\u2014a newspaper\u2014is considered a trustworthy source of information. As a contrasting example, a blog page set up under a pseudonym on a free site might be coded as \u201cUntrustworthy.\u201d Other examples of second dimensions (i.e., combined with \u201cPositive\u201d or \u201cNegative\u201d to form multi-dimensional codings) include topical\/biographical areas, such as \u201cHealth,\u201d \u201cRomantic Relationships,\u201d \u201cEthics,\u201d \u201cCompetence,\u201d and \u201cFinance.\u201d An article praising a surgeon's good outcomes could be coded as \u201cPositive\u2014Competence\u201d and a blog post ridiculing an individual for losing a large sum of money in Las Vegas could be coded as \u201cNegative\u2014Finance.\u201d","As Alice scrolls down the page presented in interface , she will be presented with additional results to code. For example, the top 20 results returned by search engine  are presented in interface . In some embodiments, if Alice codes more than a threshold number of results as not pertaining to her () additional results are shown (i.e. the next 20 results) and she is asked to code those as well. As needed, results from other sources can also be presented to ensure that a sufficient number of results pertaining to Alice have been coded. For example, the top 20 results from search engine  are presented, followed by the top 10 results from search engine , and any results found on server  or site .",{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0027","num":"0026"},"figref":"FIG. 5","b":["500","310","300","500","500","502","132","500","502","132","132","102"]},"In region  of the report, the percentage of results (e.g. the top 20 results reviewed by Alice in interface ) that are negative\/harmful is displayed. According to report , 5% of the top results for \u201cAlice Smith\u201d are negative.","In region  of the report, the percentage of results (e.g., the top 20 results reviewed by Alice in interface ) that are controllable\/editable by Alice are shown. According to report , 30% of the top results for \u201cAlice Smith\u201d are pages such as blog posts written by Alice, Alice's profile on social networking site , and\/or other places where Alice can modify what appears there.","In region , Alice is alerted that personal information about her is exposed. In example report , region  shows either a \u201cyes\u201d or a \u201cno.\u201d Alice's report includes a \u201cyes\u201d in this region because her phone number is publicly available on a people search site. In other embodiments, region  displays other information, such as by explicitly stating which information is exposed (e.g., phone number, birthday, home address) and\/or the number of sites that expose her information.","In region , Alice is alerted that at least some of the results in the top 20 results for \u201cAlice Smith\u201d are not about her, but are about at least one other individual named Alice Smith. As with region , the information presented in region  can take a variety of forms. For example, in some embodiments region  indicates the percentage of pages about Alice vs. other people sharing her name.","Region  of report  includes an assessment of Alice's reputation. In particular, it highlights to her that one of the results in the top 20 results is negative and explains why that is problematic. Additional assessment information (e.g., warning her about the exposure of her personal information) is available to Alice by clicking on region .","Region  of report  includes individualized recommendations for how Alice can improve her online reputation, based on an analysis of the top results. In particular, Alice owns (i.e., can edit) a fair amount of the top results. A recommendation is made to Alice that she can push the one negative result lower (i.e. from appearing in the top 20 results to a lower position) by authoring more content, such as more blog posts on her blog () or by signing up for professional services. If a result is coded as negative, and also is coded as being controllable\/editable by Alice, a recommendation would be made that Alice edit\/otherwise remove the negative material, since she has the ability to do so.",{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0034","num":"0033"},"figref":["FIG. 6","FIG. 6"],"b":["500","530","500","9","602","604","10","608","610"]},"The following are additional examples of assessments that can be made about an individual's online reputation, and examples of recommended actions those individuals can take.","ASSESSMENT: You have negative content in the search results seen by 99% of people who look for you online. According to ACME Interactive, 3 out of 4 individuals would refuse to interact with a person after finding negative information about them online.","RECOMMENDATION: You have a highly-rated blog. Write more posts or hire us to bury the negative content using ReputationDefender: our experts strategically create professional content for you, you review and approve our writing, and we promote this material online using our technologies. Positive content goes up and negative content goes down.","ASSESSMENT: Your personal information is easily accessible through people-search sites. This type of personal data can be used by identity thieves and stalkers to hurt you and your family. Identity theft costs American consumers $37 billion every year (ACME Research). The personal data can also be used, unfairly, by those looking to employ, date, or do business with you (e.g., to make decisions based on what part of town you live in or your age).","RECOMMENDATION: Request that your information be removed from the following sites. We can simplify the safeguarding of your personal information using our one-click MyPrivacy program. We automatically remove your personal information from the top people-search sites and prevent them from re-adding you again in the future. We also block Web tracking, telemarketers, and unsolicited postal mail.","ASSESSMENT: Your search results include a lot of information about somebody else. People could think these results are about you, giving them a bad impression. According to ACME Interactive, 3 out of 4 individuals would refuse to interact with a person after finding negative information about them online.","RECOMMENDATION: You need there to be more results about you in the top results for your name. Create more of your own content, or have us help you bury the misleading items using ReputationDefender: our experts strategically create professional content for you, you review and approve our writing, and we promote this material online using our technologies. Quality items go up and misleading content goes down.","ASSESSMENT: You have a limited online presence and are vulnerable to misrepresentation. Search results can change overnight, and surveys show that 3 out of 4 individuals would refuse to interact with a person after finding negative information about them online (ACME Interactive).","RECOMMENDATION: Expand your online presence by authoring more content, such as by starting a blog or signing up for social networking sites. You can also use ReputationDefender: our experts strategically create professional content for you, you review and approve our writing, and we promote this material online using our technologies. Quality items go up and any misleading content goes down.","ASSESSMENT: Congratulations, you currently have a strong online presence. However, search results can change overnight, and surveys show that 3 out of 4 individuals would refuse to interact with a person after finding negative information about them online (ACME Interactive). Make sure to invest into upkeep for your online reputation.","RECOMMENDATION: Allow us to monitor your results. If we notice a significant change in your online reputation, we'll contact you immediately and help correct the situation.","ASSESSMENT: You have negative content in your search results, as well as people-search sites that make you vulnerable to identity theft. Three out of four individuals would refuse to interact with a person after finding negative information about them online (ACME Interactive), and identity theft costs American consumers $37 billion every year (ACME Research).","RECOMMENDATION: Bury the negative content by writing more blog posts, or by using our ReputationDefender technology; safeguard your personal information by opting out of people-search sites. We can make it easy with our one-click MyPrivacy program.","Reputation Scoring","In some embodiments, reputation report platform  includes a scoring engine  configured to generate one or more reputation scores. As one example, a general reputation score (e.g. \u201c85\/100\u201d) can be determined for Alice by assigning scores to each of the values appearing in regions - and summing, multiplying, or otherwise aggregating the results. The five factors can be weighted differently, e.g. with \u201cPercent Negative\u201d being given more weight than \u201cSearches on Your Name.\u201d The score can be saved (e.g., in storage ), periodically recomputed, and used to help an individual such as Alice understand how her reputation has changed over time, and what factors contribute most to how she is likely to be perceived by someone trying to find out more about her online.","Reputation scores can be included in a report, such as reputation report , and can also be provided by themselves, without any additional information (and, for example, without a recommendation), omitting or modifying portion  of the process shown in . In some embodiments, instead of a specific value (e.g., 85% or 85\/100), a threshold value is applied, and a person having a reputation above the threshold is acknowledged by platform  as being considered \u201creputable,\u201d while someone with a score not meeting the threshold will not receive such an acknowledgment. Further, multiple types of reputation scores can be computed, e.g., pertaining to different aspects of an individual's reputation. As one example, where multi-dimensional coding is used (e.g., at ), a subset of coded documents can be used in the analysis performed (e.g., at ) rather than the entire set. For example, only those results coded (whether positive, negative, or neutral) pertaining to a person's professional competence, or to the person's romantic life, can be used.","In the following example, suppose that Bob would like to conduct business with Charlie. In particular, Bob would like to sell his car to Charlie, whom he met by placing a \u201cfor sale\u201d advertisement on an online classified advertisement site. Charlie would like assurance that Bob is a reputable individual. Embodiments of reputation report platform  can be used in a variety of ways, both by Bob, and by Charlie, to help Charlie feel more comfortable about transacting with Bob.","As explained above, in some embodiments, platform  is configured to receive credentials (or other access authorization) from an individual such as Bob, with respect to a variety of services. For example, Bob can provide to platform  his credentials for social networking site , allowing platform  to access () and analyze (, ) any private posts made by or about Bob. In this scenario, all posts will be applicable to Bob (and not, for example, someone else sharing his name), so Bob will not need to code the results as belonging to him or not. Further, classifier  can perform sentiment analysis on the posts, and Bob need not code the documents (e.g., as positive or negative) himself. Not enlisting Bob's assistance in coding documents can be done, both as a convenience to Bob, and also (e.g., where Bob shares information collected by platform  with others, such as Charlie) to help ensure that Bob does not attempt to game or otherwise tamper with his reputation information.","As another example, Bob could provide his credentials for an online auction site to demonstrate his ownership of a particular account on the auction site having particular feedback. Any credentials provided by Bob, and any information scraped from site  or the auction site can be stored in storage  as applicable. The documents pertaining to Bob can be used to generate a score that is sharable with Charlie in a variety of ways. As one example, Bob could provide Charlie's email address to platform  and platform  could email Charlie Bob's reputation score. As another example, Bob could instruct platform  to make available his score to Charlie for a limited amount of time (e.g. via a web interface).","In various embodiments, some, but not all aspects of Bob's reputation are considered by platform  when performing analysis (and scoring) and\/or made available to Charlie. For example, suppose Bob has an account on a dating website and has been subject to negative feedback from several of his dates due to his appearance. If Bob's entire reputation was assessed by platform  to determine a single reputation score, Bob's score might appear quite low due to the negative dating reviews. However, Bob's reputation as a prospective date likely has very little bearing on whether or not he is sufficiently reputable to sell a car to Charlie. Indeed, other aspects of Bob's reputation (e.g., determined from blog posts, news articles, data from professional networking sites, and online auction sites) might be very positive and much more probative. A report, for a particular purpose (e.g., \u201ctransact business with\u201d vs. \u201cdate\u201d) can be generated by platform  accordingly, by including or excluding certain documents from analysis based on their coding.","Additional examples of reputation assessments for specific purposes, including reputation for employment, renting real estate, loan\/financing, credit-worthiness, and admitting to school (e.g., each of which might exclude romantic reputation information but include all other aspects). A further example includes pet adoption (e.g., excluding job\/other professional information, but including reputation information indicative of good character\/kindness).","An example of a reputation report that includes a variety of scores is depicted in . In particular,  includes an overall score for Bob (), as well as scores that focus on his reputation with respect to various aspects of his life (-). Bob can learn how each of the scores was determined (and, e.g. the top positive and negative documents contributing to each) by clicking on a \u201cSee why\u201d link (e.g., link ). In some embodiments, if Bob clicks on link , he will be shown content similar to that depicted in  (i.e., listing individual results and providing recommendations pertinent to the results).","In some embodiments, Bob can provide the output generated by platform  (e.g. a report similar to report  and\/or one or more scores) to a prospective employer (or other entity interested in Bob's reputation), allowing the employer to verify that Bob is an upstanding member of society (including on social networks) without requiring Bob to divulge his credentials to the prospective employer or otherwise compromise his privacy. For example, suppose Bob clicks a \u201cShare\u201d link (e.g., link ) in the interface shown in . In response, platform  can ask Bob a series of questions, such as who he would like to share the information with, at what level of detail, and in what manner. As one example, Bob could ask platform  to mail score  to Charlie. As another example, Bob could obtain from platform  a temporary link to give to Charlie, that will allow Charlie to view Bob's score  for a limited period of time (e.g., one viewing, one day, or one week). As yet another example, Bob could request platform  to generate a report (e.g. as a PDF) and mail it to Charlie.","Although the foregoing embodiments have been described in some detail for purposes of clarity of understanding, the invention is not limited to the details provided. There are many alternative ways of implementing the invention.
