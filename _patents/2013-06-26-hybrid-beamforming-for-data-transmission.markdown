{"@attributes":{"id":"description"},"RELAPP":[{},{}],"heading":["RELATED APPLICATIONS","BACKGROUND","DETAILED DESCRIPTION","EXAMPLE EMBODIMENTS"],"p":["This application claims the benefit of and hereby incorporates by reference U.S. Provisional Patent Application Ser. No. 61\/806,821, filed Mar. 29, 2013.","Wireless mobile communication technology uses various standards and protocols to transmit data between a node (e.g., a transmission station or a transceiver node) and a wireless device (e.g., a mobile device). Some wireless devices communicate using orthogonal frequency-division multiple access (OFDMA) in a downlink (DL) transmission and single carrier frequency division multiple access (SC-FDMA) in an uplink (UL) transmission. Standards and protocols that use orthogonal frequency-division multiplexing (OFDM) for signal transmission include the third generation partnership project (3GPP) long term evolution (LTE), the Institute of Electrical and Electronics Engineers (IEEE) 802.16 standard (e.g., 802.16e, 802.16m), which is commonly known to industry groups as WiMAX (Worldwide interoperability for Microwave Access), and the IEEE 802.11 standard, which is commonly known to industry groups as WiFi.","In 3GPP radio access network (RAN) LTE systems, the node can be a combination of Evolved Universal Terrestrial Radio Access Network (E-UTRAN) Node Bs (also commonly denoted as evolved Node Bs, enhanced Node Bs, eNodeBs, or eNBs) and Radio Network Controllers (RNCs), which communicate with the wireless device, known as a user equipment (UE). The downlink (DL) transmission (also known as a broadcast channel (BC)) can be a communication from the node (e.g., eNodeB) to the wireless device (e.g., UE), and the uplink (UL) transmission (also known as a multiple access channel (MAC)) can be a communication from the wireless device to the node.","The eNB can have multiple antennas used for transmission to the UEs, allowing the eNB to use multiple-input and multiple-output (MIMO). MIMO is a smart antenna technology that refers to the use of multiple antennas at both the transmitter and receiver to improve communication performance, where input and output refer to a radio channel carrying the signal, not necessarily to the devices having antennas. In MIMO, up to eight transmit or receive antennas can be used, or up to eight channels can be used for transmission of a resource.","Reference will now be made to the exemplary embodiments illustrated, and specific language will be used herein to describe the same. It will nevertheless be understood that no limitation of the scope of the invention is thereby intended.","Before the present invention is disclosed and described, it is to be understood that this invention is not limited to the particular structures, process steps, or materials disclosed herein, but is extended to equivalents thereof as would be recognized by those ordinarily skilled in the relevant arts. It should also be understood that terminology employed herein is used for the purpose of describing particular examples only and is not intended to be limiting. The same reference numerals in different drawings represent the same element. Numbers provided in flow charts and processes are provided for clarity in illustrating steps and operations and do not necessarily indicate a particular order or sequence.","An initial overview of technology embodiments is provided below and then specific technology embodiments are described in further detail later. This initial summary is intended to aid readers in understanding the technology more quickly but is not intended to identify key features or essential features of the technology nor is it intended to limit the scope of the claimed subject matter.","A wireless communication system can be subdivided into various sections referred to as layers. In the LTE system, communication layers can include the physical (PHY), media access control (MAC), radio link control (RLC), packet data convergence protocol (PDCP), and radio resource control (RRC) layers. The physical layer can include the basic hardware transmission components of a wireless communication system , as illustrated in . A basic multiple-input multiple-output (MIMO) system is used for simplicity in illustrating the basic hardware transmission components, but the components can also be adapted for a complex MIMO system, a single-input and single-output (SISO) system, or similar system. For example in a MIMO system, at the transmitter , binary input data  can be protected through encoding using a channel encoder , interleaved against fading phenomenon using an interleaver , and mapped to improve reliability using a mapper . The mapped data can be separated into layers for antenna ports by a transmitter (TX) beamformer  and the layers can be OFDM modulated into OFDM symbols using modulators A-B. The modulators can use an inverse fast Fourier transform (IFFT) algorithm to compute the inverse discrete Fourier transform (IDFT) to generate modulated signals (vector x for each antenna port). The modulated signals can be converted to analog signals with digital-to-analog converters (DACs) A-B. The analog signals can be transmitted via radio frequency (RF) transmitters (Txs) A-B configured to send the signal to transmitter antennas A-B operable to communicate the signal. The analog signals will follow a path referred to as a channel. The analog signals travelling through that path can be referred to as a channel signal . The physical layer can include other components (not shown), such as series-to-parallel (S\/P) converters, parallel-to-serial (P\/S) converters, cyclic prefix (CP) inserters and deleters, guardband inserters and deleters, and other desired components.","The transmitted channel signal  can be subject to noise  and interference . The interference can include intra-cell interference and intercell interference. Intra-cell interference can refer to interference from other channel signals transmitted within the cell of the transmitter . Intercell interference can refer to interference from other channel signals transmitted by neighboring cells. The noise and interference is represented as an addition  to the channel signal, which can be received by receiver antennas A-B and one or more radio frequency (RF) receivers (Rxs) A-B at the receiver . The channel signal combined with the noise and interference can be converted to a digital modulated signal with analog-to-digital converters (ADCs) A-B. The digital signal can be OFDM demodulated using demodulators A-B. The demodulators can use a fast Fourier transform (FFT) algorithm to compute the discrete Fourier transform (DFT) to generate demodulated signals (vector y for each antenna port). A channel estimator  can use the demodulated signal to estimate the channel  and the noise and interference that occurs in the channel. The channel estimator can include a feedback generator or be in communication with the feedback generator, which can generate a physical uplink shared channel (PUSCH) feedback report, such as a channel quality indicator (CQI) report, a precoding matrix indicator (PMI) report, or a transmission rank indicator (RI) report. The CQI can be used to assist the MIMO transmissions modes. The demodulated signals can be combined using a MIMO decoder , demapped using a demapper , deinterleaved using a deinterleaver , and decoded by a channel decoder  to generate binary output data  that can be used by other layers of the receiving station.",{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0028","num":"0027"},"figref":["FIG. 2","FIG. 1","FIG. 2"],"b":["424","426","434","428","460","300","320","330","340","360","370","380","310","350","590"]},"In one example, the resource elements (REs) can represent elements of a radio frame structure transmitted on the physical (PHY) layer in a downlink transmission between a node (e.g., eNodeB) and the wireless device (e.g., UE) using a generic 3GPP long term evolution (LTE) frame structure, as illustrated in .",{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0030","num":"0029"},"figref":"FIG. 3","b":["100","110","120","120","120","160","166","120"],"i":["i ","a ","b","a ","b "]},"Each slot for a component carrier (CC) used by the node and the wireless device can include multiple resource blocks (RBs) , , , , and based on the CC frequency bandwidth. The CC can have a carrier frequency having a bandwidth and center frequency. Each subframe of the CC can include downlink control information (DCI) found in the legacy PDCCH. The legacy PDCCH in the control region can include one to three columns of the first OFDM symbols in each subframe or physical RB (PRB), when a legacy PDCCH is used. The remaining 11 to 13 OFDM symbols (or 14 OFDM symbols, when legacy PDCCH is not used) in the subframe may be allocated to the PDSCH for data (for short or normal cyclic prefix).","The control region can include physical control format indicator channel (PCFICH), physical hybrid automatic repeat request (hybrid-ARQ) indicator channel (PHICH), and the PDCCH. The control region has a flexible control design to avoid unnecessary overhead. The number of OFDM symbols in the control region used for the PDCCH can be determined by the control channel format indicator (CFI) transmitted in the physical control format indicator channel (PCFICH). The PCFICH can be located in the first OFDM symbol of each subframe. The PCFICH and PHICH can have priority over the PDCCH, so the PCFICH and PHICH are scheduled prior to the PDCCH.","Each RB (physical RB or PRB) can include 12-15 kHz subcarriers  (on the frequency axis) and 6 or 7 orthogonal frequency-division multiplexing (OFDM) symbols  (on the time axis) per slot. The RB can use seven OFDM symbols if a short or normal cyclic prefix is employed. The RB can use six OFDM symbols if an extended cyclic prefix is used. The resource block can be mapped to 84 resource elements (REs) using short or normal cyclic prefixing, or the resource block can be mapped to 72 REs (not shown) using extended cyclic prefixing. The RE can be a unit of one OFDM symbol  by one subcarrier (i.e., 15 kHz) .","Each RE can transmit two bits and of information in the case of quadrature phase-shift keying (QPSK) modulation. Other types of modulation may be used, such as 16 quadrature amplitude modulation (QAM) or 64 QAM to transmit a greater number of bits in each RE, or bi-phase shift keying (BPSK) modulation to transmit a lesser number of bits (a single bit) in each RE. The RB can be configured for a downlink transmission from the eNodeB to the UE, or the RB can be configured for an uplink transmission from the UE to the eNodeB.",{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0035","num":"0034"},"figref":["FIG. 4A","FIG. 4B","FIG. 4C","FIG. 4D"],"b":["810","830","810","840","820","830","820","840"]},"A MIMO wireless network can be used for beamforming. Beamforming or spatial filtering is a signal processing technique used in antenna arrays for directional signal transmission or reception. Beamforming can be achieved by combining elements in a phased array in such a way that signals at particular angles experience constructive interference while others experience destructive interference. Beamforming can be used at both the transmitting and receiving ends in order to achieve spatial selectivity.","A way to increase the spectral efficiency (SE) in the wireless network (e.g., cellular systems) is utilizing a large number of antennas that employed at a base station or node (e.g., eNB). Massive MIMO can refer a number of antennas in the large antenna array exceeding eight (8) antennas, such as 16, 32, or 64 antennas. Spectral efficiency (SE) spectrum efficiency or bandwidth efficiency refers to the information rate that can be transmitted over a given bandwidth in a specific communication system. SE can be a measure of how efficiently a limited frequency spectrum is utilized by the physical layer protocol, and sometimes by the media access control (the channel access protocol).","Dirty paper coding (DPC) can be an optimal data transmission scheme for a MIMO broadcast channel. Although DPC can maximize the rate and achieve Shannon capacity, the implementation can have a high degree of complexity. DPC is a technique for efficient transmission of digital data through a channel subjected to some interference known to the transmitter. The technique can consist of precoding the data in order to cancel the effect caused by the interference. Dirty-paper coding can achieve a channel capacity, without a power penalty and without requiring a receiver to gain knowledge of the interference state. Channel capacity is the tightest upper bound on the rate of information that can be reliably transmitted over a communications channel. By a noisy-channel coding theorem, the channel capacity of a given channel is the limiting information rate (in units of information per unit time) that can be achieved with arbitrarily small error probability. Information theory or Shannon capacity defines the notion of channel capacity and provides a mathematical model by which channel capacity can be computed. A result of Shannon capacity states that the capacity of the channel can be given by a maximum of the mutual information between an input and an output of the channel, where the maximization is with respect to the input distribution.","Precoding can be a generalization of beamforming to support multi-stream (or multi-layer) transmission in multi-antenna wireless communications. For example, in single-stream beamforming, a same signal can be emitted from each of the transmit antennas with appropriate weighting (e.g., phase and gain) such that the signal power can be maximized at a receiver output. When a receiver has multiple antennas, single-stream beamforming may not simultaneously maximize the signal level at all of the receive antennas. To maximize the throughput in multiple receive antenna systems, multi-stream transmission can be used, which can be provided by precoding.","Several suboptimal linear precoding schemes have been proposed. Although for a fixed number of users, the rates resulting from various suboptimal linear precoding schemes may be less than the channel capacity, linear precoding schemes can achieve channel capacity asymptotically (i.e., when a number of users goes to infinity). Two linear precoding schemes include zero-forcing beamforming (ZFBF) and random beamforming (RBF).","With ZFBF, a beam used for data transmission to one user (e.g., UE) can be designed in such a way that the beam lies in the null space of the space formed by the other users' channel vectors. For example, in a cell consisting of K users if vis the vector used to serve user k and his the channel to any other user i, vand hcan be orthogonal (i.e., v\u22a5h). The beamforming vectors vcan be calculated at the base station (eNB) by forming channel matrix whose columns are channel vectors h, h, . . . h, taking the inverse of channel matrix and normalizing the columns of the resulting matrix. As a result. ZFBF can remove or cancel inter-user intra-cell interference when the channel information for all the users in the cell is known at the node (e.g., eNB). However, in practical cellular systems some interference may remain because the channel information at the node (e.g., eNB) may not be perfect. The imprecise channel information can be due to the channel estimation at the user based on the reference signal and then quantized to be sent to the base station. Both the channel estimation and the quantization processes can introduce some error to the channel information. Moreover, another difficulty in ZFBF can be user selection and pairing which can introduce complexity when the number of active users in the cell is large.","Quantization is the process of mapping a large set of input values to a smaller set, such as rounding values to some unit of precision. A device or algorithmic function that performs quantization is called a quantizer. The round-off error introduced by quantization is referred to as quantization error. For example, an optimal beam may be quantized to a discrete index of the optimal beam, such as a precoding matrix indicator (PMI). In another example, a signal-to-interference-plus-noise ratio (SINR) for the optimal beam may be quantized to a discrete SINR value, such as a channel quality indicator (CQI).","The PMI can be a signal fed back by the UE to support a multiple-input multiple-output (MIMO) operation. The PMI can correspond to an index of the precoder (within a codebook shared by the UE and eNodeB), which can maximize an aggregate number of data bits which can be received across all downlink spatial transmission layers. The CQI can be signaled by a UE to the eNodeB to indicate a suitable data rate, such as a modulation and coding scheme (MCS) value, for downlink transmissions, which can be based on a measurement of the received downlink signal to interference plus noise ratio (SINR) and knowledge of the UE's receiver characteristics. A signal-to-noise-and-interference ratio (SINR) or signal-to-interference ratio (S\/I or SIR), also known as the carrier-to-interference ratio (C\/I, CIR), refers to the quotient between the average received modulated carrier power S or C and the average received co-channel interference power I (i.e., cross-talk, from other transmitters than the useful signal).","Another approach for linear precoding is random beamforming (RBF). In RBF each user (e.g., UE) can calculate an optimal beam (among a set of orthogonal beams) by maximizing the optimal beam's received SINR and report an index of the optimal beam (e.g., PMI) along with the optimal SINR (e.g., CQI). The node can then select one user per beam based on the SINR values and serve those users with the beams the users requested. As a result, user selection and scheduling process at the node can be simplified over other linear precoding schemes. Furthermore, a beamforming vector calculation may not be needed at the node. Moreover, because the same beam can be used for an SINR calculation by the user and data transmission at the node, reduced to no mismatch may occur between reference signals used in the SINR calculation and data transmission for RBF. However, inter-user intra-cell interference may not be cancelled using RBF (e.g., unlike ZFBF), because the beam for one user may not be orthogonal to a channel of other users. In addition, as users assume that the other beams can be used in data transmission phase, the calculated SINRs (e.g., CQIs) based on RBF can be considered pessimistic. Conversely, the calculated SINRs (e.g., CQIs) based on ZFBF can be considered optimistic (especially, relative to RBF). In an example, a pessimistic SINR can provide a lower bound on the SINR and an optimistic SINR can provide an upper bound on the SINR.","In an example, a wireless system can use adaptive technology or hybrid ZFBF and RBF technology using both ZFBF and RBF, which can be used to improve system performance. The adaptive technology or hybrid ZFBF and RBF technology can include methods, computer circuitry, systems, user equipments (UEs), or nodes (e.g., eNB).",{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0046","num":"0045"},"figref":"FIG. 5","b":["220","232","234","236","242","244","246"],"sub":"n"},"In a simple RBF example, each UE can calculate its optimal channel direction (PMI) using a codebook known to both the eNB and the UE.

For example, each UE k can first obtain an estimated channel \u0125from the received reference signals (e.g., pilots) and then multiple downlink SINRs may be calculated at the UE assuming that the UE is served by beam \u03c6and other UEs in the cell are served by other beams \u03c6, i\u2260n, which can be represented as Expression 1.",{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0048","num":"0047"},"maths":{"@attributes":{"id":"MATH-US-00001","num":"00001"},"math":{"@attributes":{"overflow":"scroll"},"mtable":{"mtr":{"mtd":[{"mrow":{"mrow":[{"mrow":{"mo":"\u2062","msub":{"mi":"INR","mrow":{"mi":["n","k"],"mo":","}}},"mo":"=","mfrac":{"msup":{"mrow":{"mo":["\uf603","\uf604"],"mrow":{"msub":[{"mover":{"mi":"h","mo":"^"},"mi":"k"},{"mi":"\u03d5","msup":{"mi":"n","mo":"*"}}],"mo":"\u2062"}},"mn":"2"},"mrow":{"mn":"1","mo":["+","+"],"mrow":[{"munderover":{"mo":"\u2211","mrow":{"mrow":[{"mi":"i","mo":"=","mn":"1"},{"mi":"j","mo":"\u2260","msup":{"mi":"n","mo":"*"}}],"mo":","},"mi":"N"},"mo":["\u2062","\u2062"],"mstyle":{"mspace":{"@attributes":{"width":"0.3em","height":"0.3ex"}}},"msup":{"mrow":{"mo":["\uf603","\uf604"],"mrow":{"msub":[{"mover":{"mi":"h","mo":"^"},"mi":"k"},{"mi":["\u03d5","i"]}],"mo":"\u2062"}},"mn":"2"}},{"mi":["Intercell","Interference"],"mo":["\u2062","\u2062"],"mstyle":{"mspace":{"@attributes":{"width":"0.8em","height":"0.8ex"}}}}]}}},{"mi":"n","mo":"=","mn":"1"}],"mo":[",","\u2062",",",",","\u2062",","],"mstyle":[{"mtext":{}},{"mspace":{"@attributes":{"width":"0.8em","height":"0.8ex"}}}],"mn":"2","mi":["\u2026","N"]}},{"mrow":{"mo":["[","]"],"mrow":{"mi":"Expression","mo":["\u2062","\u2062"],"mstyle":{"mspace":{"@attributes":{"width":"0.8em","height":"0.8ex"}}},"mn":"1"}}}]}}}}},"Consequently, optimal SINR (CQI) can be represented by Expression 2 and the PMI is the index of \u03c6which maximizes INRover n.",{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0050","num":"0049"},"maths":{"@attributes":{"id":"MATH-US-00002","num":"00002"},"math":{"@attributes":{"overflow":"scroll"},"mtable":{"mtr":{"mtd":[{"mrow":{"mrow":[{"mo":"\u2062","msubsup":{"mi":["INR","k"],"mo":"*"}},{"mrow":{"msub":{"mi":["max","n"]},"mo":"\u2062","mrow":{"mo":"\u2062","msub":{"mi":"INR","mrow":{"mi":["n","k"],"mo":","}}}},"mo":"=","mfrac":{"msup":{"mrow":{"mo":["\uf603","\uf604"],"mrow":{"msub":[{"mover":{"mi":"h","mo":"^"},"mi":"k"},{"mi":"\u03d5","msup":{"mi":"n","mo":"*"}}],"mo":"\u2062"}},"mn":"2"},"mrow":{"mn":"1","mo":["+","+"],"mrow":[{"munderover":{"mo":"\u2211","mrow":{"mrow":[{"mi":"i","mo":"=","mn":"1"},{"mi":"j","mo":"\u2260","msup":{"mi":"n","mo":"*"}}],"mo":","},"mi":"N"},"mo":["\u2062","\u2062"],"mstyle":{"mspace":{"@attributes":{"width":"0.3em","height":"0.3ex"}}},"msup":{"mrow":{"mo":["\uf603","\uf604"],"mrow":{"msub":[{"mover":{"mi":"h","mo":"^"},"mi":"k"},{"mi":["\u03d5","i"]}],"mo":"\u2062"}},"mn":"2"}},{"mi":["Intercell","Interference"],"mo":["\u2062","\u2062"],"mstyle":{"mspace":{"@attributes":{"width":"0.8em","height":"0.8ex"}}}}]}}}],"mo":"="}},{"mrow":{"mo":["[","]"],"mrow":{"mi":"Expression","mo":["\u2062","\u2062"],"mstyle":{"mspace":{"@attributes":{"width":"0.8em","height":"0.8ex"}}},"mn":"2"}}}]}}}}},"For expressions 1 and 2 the beams can be assumed not to be reused in the neighboring interfering cells.

On the other hand, the ZFBF CQI calculation can be based on a single user (SU) (e.g., expression 4) and as a result some interference mismatch in addition to the channel mismatch can occur, as can be observed in expression 6.","However, RBF can have a low data rate per UE as the calculated SINR at each UE assumes N\u22121 other UEs are served in the same resource, which can result in a large interference power in the denominator of SINR(expression 1). In some cases larger SINRs and throughputs may be achievable by serving fewer UEs as serving fewer UEs can reduce the interference in the system.","Therefore, depending on an amount of overhead and system complexity, several hybrid ZFBF\/RBF schemes can be used.","In an example (alternative 1), a UE can feed back PMI along with either a CQI(CQI assuming RBF) or a CQI(CQI assuming ZFBF).  illustrates alternative 1, where UEs can be divided into two groups by the eNB based on the UE's channel condition, average throughput, or other similar criteria.

techniques, or certain aspects or portions thereof, may take the form of program code (i.e., instructions) embodied in tangible media, such as floppy diskettes, compact disc-read-only memory (CD-ROMs), hard drives, non-transitory computer readable storage medium, or any other machine-readable storage medium wherein, when the program code is loaded into and executed by a machine, such as a computer, the machine becomes an apparatus for practicing the various techniques. Circuitry can include hardware, firmware, program code, executable code, computer instructions, and\/or software. A non-transitory computer readable storage medium can be a computer readable storage medium that does not include signal. In the case of program code execution on programmable computers, the computing device may include a processor, a storage medium readable by the processor (including volatile and non-volatile memory and\/or storage elements), at least one input device, and at least one output device. The volatile and non-volatile memory and\/or storage elements may be a random-access memory (RAM), erasable programmable read only memory (EPROM), flash drive, optical drive, magnetic hard drive, solid state drive, or other medium for storing electronic data. The node and wireless device may also include a transceiver module (i.e., transceiver), a counter module (i.e., counter), a processing module (i.e., processor), and\/or a clock module (i.e., clock) or timer module (i.e., timer). One or more programs that may implement or utilize the various techniques described herein may use an application programming interface (API), reusable controls, and the like. Such programs may be implemented in a high level procedural or object oriented programming language to communicate with a computer system. However, the program(s) may be implemented in assembly or machine language, if desired. In any case, the language may be a compiled or interpreted language, and combined with hardware implementations.","It should be understood that many of the functional units described in this specification have been labeled as modules, in order to more particularly emphasize their implementation independence. For example, a module may be implemented as a hardware circuit comprising custom very-large-scale integration (VLSI) circuits or gate arrays, off-the-shelf semiconductors such as logic chips, transistors, or other discrete components. A module may also be implemented in programmable hardware devices such as field programmable gate arrays, programmable array logic, programmable logic devices or the like.","Modules may also be implemented in software for execution by various types of processors. An identified module of executable code may, for instance, comprise one or more physical or logical blocks of computer instructions, which may, for instance, be organized as an object, procedure, or function. Nevertheless, the executables of an identified module need not be physically located together, but may comprise disparate instructions stored in different locations which, when joined logically together, comprise the module and achieve the stated purpose for the module.","Indeed a module of executable code may be a single instruction, or many instructions, and may even be distributed over several different code segments, among different programs and across several memory devices. Similarly, operational data may be identified and illustrated herein within modules, and may be embodied in any suitable form and organized within any suitable type of data structure. The operational data may be collected as a single data set, or may be distributed over different locations including over different storage devices and may exist, at least partially, merely as electronic signals on a system or network. The modules may be passive or active, including agents operable to perform desired functions.","Reference throughout this specification to \u201can example\u201d or \u201cexemplary\u201d means that a particular feature, structure, or characteristic described in connection with the example is included in at least one embodiment of the present invention. Thus, appearances of the phrases \u201cin an example\u201d or the word \u201cexemplary\u201d in various places throughout this specification are not necessarily all referring to the same embodiment.","As used herein, a plurality of items, structural elements, compositional elements, and\/or materials may be presented in a common list for convenience. However, these lists should be construed as though each member of the list is individually identified as a separate and unique member. Thus, no individual member of such list should be construed as a de facto equivalent of any other member of the same list solely based on their presentation in a common group without indications to the contrary. In addition, various embodiments and example of the present invention may be referred to herein along with alternatives for the various components thereof. It is understood that such embodiments, examples, and alternatives are not to be construed as defacto equivalents of one another, but are to be considered as separate and autonomous representations of the present invention.","Furthermore, the described features, structures or characteristics may be combined in any suitable manner in one or more embodiments. In the following description, numerous specific details are provided, such as examples of layouts, distances, network examples, etc., to provide a thorough understanding of embodiments of the invention. One skilled in the relevant art will recognize, however, that the invention can be practiced without one or more of the specific details, or with other methods, components, layouts, etc. In other instances well-known structures, materials, or operations are not shown or described in detail to avoid obscuring aspects of the invention.","While the forgoing examples are illustrative of the principles of the present invention in one or more particular applications, it will be apparent to those of ordinary skill in the art that numerous modifications in form, usage and details of implementation can be made without the exercise of inventive faculty, and without departing from the principles and concepts of the invention.
