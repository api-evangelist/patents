{"@attributes":{"id":"description"},"BRFSUM":[{},{}],"heading":["TECHNICAL FIELD","BACKGROUND","SUMMARY","DESCRIPTION OF EXAMPLE EMBODIMENTS"],"p":["The present disclosure generally relates to responding to information requests (such as writs, subpoenas, and other forms of requests for information), and in particular, to systems for facilitating responses to such requests for network service providers.","A writ is a formal written order issued by a body with administrative or judicial jurisdiction, commanding the person or legal entity to whom it is addressed to provide information described in the writ. Warrants, prerogative writs and subpoenas are types of writs. Web service providers, such as social networking systems, email providers, and the like, typically maintain an array of data regarding its users. Typically, each web service provider controls access to user information based on a privacy policy. Currently, when web service providers receive a writ from a law enforcement agency, there is no automated system to assist with preparing a response. Rather, gathering the data relating to an identified user generally involves a manual process of generating several queries and collecting the information.","The present invention provides methods, apparatuses and systems facilitating responses to writs, such as subpoenas, in an efficient and timely manner. Implementations of the invention may include a writ response module and a queue manager to offer web service providers to automatically generate reports in response to various writs and to prioritize processing and human review prior to delivery of results.","The invention is now described in detail with reference to a few embodiments thereof as illustrated in the accompanying drawings. In the following description, numerous specific details are set forth in order to provide a thorough understanding of the present disclosure. It is apparent, however, to one skilled in the art, that the present disclosure may be practiced without some or all of these specific details. In other instances, well known process steps and\/or structures have not been described in detail in order not to unnecessarily obscure the present disclosure. In addition, while the disclosure is described in conjunction with the particular embodiments, it should be understood that this description is not intended to limit the disclosure to the described embodiments. To the contrary, the description is intended to cover alternatives, modifications, and equivalents as may be included within the spirit and scope of the disclosure as defined by the appended claims.","A writ is a formal written order issued by a body with administrative or judicial jurisdiction, commanding the person to whom it is addressed to do or refrain from doing some specified act. Warrants, prerogative writs and subpoenas are types of writs. A subpoena is a legal order commanding the person or organization named in the subpoena to give sworn testimony at a specified time and place about a matter concerned in an investigation or a legal proceeding, such as a trial. Witnesses or nonparties to litigation may be in possession of relevant materials and, as such, may be subject to subpoenas, preservation notices or legal holds. A legal hold, for example, is a communication that suspends the normal disposition or processing of records and may alternatively be called a \u201cpreservation notice,\u201d \u201cpreservation order\u201d or \u201chold notice.\u201d","Preservation notices or requests may precede the issuance of a subpoena, which makes formal legal demand for the production of the needed items. Elements may include but are not limited to the following: a statement of the name, venue and basic elements of the litigation or investigation sufficient that the recipient can fully understand the matter at hand; a description of the legal or business relationship between the requesting party and the non-party recipient; a copy of or reference to any contract or agreement that was in effect during the relevant time period; identification of the range of different types of material to be preserved; a request to halt normal business practices that may destroy potential evidence, such as server back-up tape rotation, electronic data shredding, drive re-imaging, the sale\/gift\/destruction of computer systems and disk defragmentation or routine computer maintenance; instructions to communicate retention obligations to all persons either in the organization or in control of the organization who may have access to relevant material, as well as to any IT personnel or employees with hands-on access to electronic and computer systems; a request that the recipient direct any questions about the subject matter or scope of the notice to a designated legal representative of the requesting party; a request that the non-party recipient periodically reissue and refresh the notice distributed to remind persons having relevant material that the notice is still in effect until they are otherwise advised; written acknowledgement of receipt of notice; confirmation of intent to comply with preservation request; and the like.","A privacy policy is a legal document that discloses some or all of the ways a network or web service provider gathers, uses, discloses and manages a user's or customer's data. The exact terms of a privacy policy will depend upon the service and applicable law and may need to address the requirements of a variety of different jurisdictions. While there is no universal guidance for the content of specific privacy policies, generally service providers require personally identifying information such as name, email, gender, birth date, finance information, contact information, and the like. They use this information to manage the service, to contact users, to make advertisement suggestions, and the like.","On the other hand, when a crime is committed, a government law enforcement agency may request a web or network service provider to provide information related to an identified user or other legal entity. In other situations, law enforcement or other government agencies may also seek user information in connection with civil or administrative matters. The requests may be in the form of preservation requests, subpoenas, search warrants, court orders, or related legal writs. For service providers, there exists a tension between preserving user privacy and responding in a timely manner to legal process requests. Accordingly, for larger service providers, it may require a significant amount of human resources to gather the requested information and fulfill the requests, while at the same time guarding user privacy to the greatest extent possible.","Currently, when web service providers who have user information receive a writ from a law enforcement agency (LEA), there is no automated system to facilitate generating responses that include the requested data. Most of the time, there is one person or group in charge of handling responses to writs. This person or group generally validates the response, gathers related data, and then sends the data to the requesting LEA. However, searching for and collecting data takes an extensive amount of time and may result in a delayed response. For example, relevant information may be stored in user profile or account databases, server or web logs, and the like.","Various implementations of the invention provide an example system that automatically generates responses to various writs in an efficient and prioritized manner to assist network service providers in complying with such writs in a timely and efficient process.  is a functional block diagram that illustrates an example system and network environment. As  illustrates, an example network environment and system includes one or more law enforcement agencies , a writ portal system , a writ response system , and a network service provider system . Writ portal system  is an automated or semi-automated system that LEAs can use to submit various types of writs and data preservation requests for execution. LEAs may access writ portal system  by email, phone, and fax, causing a human operator to process a writ request. In other implementations, LEAs may access writ portal system  using a computing system to send a writ request to writ portal system  that supports a set of application programming interfaces (APIs) that facilitate submission of requests to the writ portal system . Writ portal system  may interface with a variety of different LEAs over a vast array of communications channels. In one implementation, writ portal system  is responsible for translating writ requests in various different forms and formats into one of a standardized set of writ requests for submission to writ response system . In one implementation, writ portal system  may be operated by a third party relative to the entity or enterprise that operates and maintains writ response system  and\/or network service provider system . For example, writ portal system  may be maintained by a specialized, third party service or platform\u2014such as Yaana Technologies, LLC of Milpitas, Calif. In one implementation, writ portal system  maintains computerized systems that transmit requests for information corresponding to a given writ and also include scheduling functionality that retries the requests based on a schedule to later obtain the requested information.","In one implementation, writ response system  supports a set of APIs that allows writ portal system  to register writ requests for processing. In one implementation, writ response system  supports HTTP functionality allowing writ portal system  to transmit writ requests. In one implementation, a writ request includes one or more of the following attributes: a user identifier (or identifying information that maps to a user identifier), a type of writ (e.g., preservation request, pen register, subpoena, warrant, etc.), an identifier for the requesting law enforcement agency, and one or more tags describing meta information about the request, and copies of (or links to) supporting documentation (including, in some instances, the formal writ itself). As discussed below, writ response system  is operative to process the request, schedule one or more synchronous and\/or asynchronous data generation jobs, and deliver a response to the writ request.","Writ response system  accesses one or more systems of network service provider system  to generate data responsive to a given writ request. In one implementation, writ response system  generates one or more jobs that query various systems of network service provider system  based on the type of writ associated with the request. In most implementations, the same enterprise or legal entity maintains both writ response system  and network service provider system . In other implementations, writ response system  is maintained as a third party system separate from network service provider system.",{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0019","num":"0018"},"figref":"FIG. 2","b":["106","106","104","202","204","106","206","104","104","104"]},"Writ response system  then generates one or more data generation jobs based on the type of writ (). For example, different writ types may require access to different types of information maintained by or available through network service provider system . As discussed above, writ types may include preservation requests, pen registers, subpoenas, search warrants, court orders, and the like. In addition, some job types may spawn synchronous requests, while others may spawn asynchronous requests. Still further, some jobs may be executed periodically to gather data over successive intervals.","Network service provider system  may host one or more network applications. In embodiments where network service provider  hosts a social networking application, the data generation jobs may include jobs directed to retrieving one or more of the following attributes or information types: 1) user profile information associated with the user identifier, 2) wall posts associated with the user identifier, 3) news feed items associated with the user identifier, 4) notes, 5) shared links, 6) installed applications, 7) group memberships, 8) events associated with the user identifier; 9) friends or contacts associated with the user identifier; 10) basic subscriber or user information, 11) photographs associated with the user identifier; 12) chat logs, and 13) web logs (time stamp, user id, URL, and remote IP address). Other types of network applications may include other types of information, such as emails sent or received, web pages sent or received, blog posts, and the like. In addition, some report generation jobs may check the data stores maintained by writ response system  to determine whether any data was stored in response to a previously issued preservation request. This information may be maintained by a variety of different systems internal to network service provider system . As discussed above, writ response system  may generate one or more different jobs that may be served synchronously or asynchronously. Responses generated by the different jobs are processed by a queue manager that, as discussed below, may place the responses on a queue in a manner that is prioritized based on one or more tags or other information associated with a request or case.","In one implementation, some writ types may require approval before execution. For example, search warrants, subpoenas, and the like may require approval prior to execution. For such writ types, writ response system  may route these requests to a pre-approval queue for review by an administrator (, ). Otherwise, writ response system  routes the request to one or more job queues for execution (). For example, in one implementation, preservation requests are routed directly for processing, as no information is returned in response to the requests. Rather, a follow-up search warrant or subpoena is generally required to obtain the preserved information. As data is generated and returned, it is stored in a persistent data store in association with the case identifier. Receipt of the information also causes a review job entry to be placed on a review queue by a queue manager process that may prioritize placement on the queue based on one or more attributes of the case.","If the writ request corresponds to an existing case (), writ response system  creates a new request entry in a requests table (). Writ response system  may also access a data store of responsive information to determine whether any data has been generated for the case that has been approved for release (, ). If no data exists or has been approved for release, writ response system  returns a response indicating that no data is currently available (). Otherwise, if data is available and approved for release, writ response system transmits a response including the data to writ portal system  (or directly to the requesting LEA). In some implementations, the process flow may differ. For example, if the writ request is a preservation request, writ response system  may respond with an indication that data has been retrieved and stored. However, since the preservation request is not a formal subpoena or court order, no actual information is returned.","A writ request or case may be tagged at various points in a writ response process workflow. The tags appended to the request may influence where jobs, responses and\/or requests themselves are placed on various processing queues, such as job queues, review queues and the like. For example, writ portal system  may add tags to the writ request that indicate context for the request (such as whether the underlying case involves a crime, such as kidnapping, or otherwise requires a response on an urgent basis). Still further, an administrator reviewing requests on a pre-approval queue may examine the supporting documentation and add tags to the request that include context information. In some implementations, the reviewer may directly classify the case as high priority. Some of the factors that a review or a programmatic process may consider when deciding whether a case is high priority include: the country or local of the user identifier, requesting agency or underlying incident; the name of the requesting agency; the age of the user associated with the user identifier; whether the user account is believed to be fake or real; the nature of the underlying, alleged crime (if any); context information (e.g., child exploitation, pornography, contraband, terrorism); the type of legal writ; and the type of threat posed generally or to the network service provider.",{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0025","num":"0024"},"figref":["FIG. 3","FIG. 1"],"b":["106","120","124","302","120","304","120","306","120","120","120","124","104","106","120"]},"After the requested report is approved, there is a delivery step. As discussed above, the report may be provided the next time a writ portal system  transmits a request for the report. In some instances, however, a rule set may determine whether to use other means. For example, writ response system, for certain types of requests, may send push notifications to writ portal system  or directly to the requesting LEA system  that a report is ready for retrieval.","Particular embodiments may be implemented in a network environment.  illustrates an example network environment  suitable for providing software validation as a service.
