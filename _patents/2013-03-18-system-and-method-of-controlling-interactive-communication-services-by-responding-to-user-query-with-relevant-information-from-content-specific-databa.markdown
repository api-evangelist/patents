title: System and method of controlling interactive communication services by responding to user query with relevant information from content specific database
abstract: An electronic communication system is controlled by a content service provider to return relevant information from a content specific database in response to a user query. The content service provider compiles a plurality of content specific databases, each dedicated to a category of information of interest to the user. The user registers a user profile with the content service provider. A query, including the selected content specific database, is transmitted from the user to the content service provider. The selected content specific database is searched for the first level query within context of the user profile. A menu of matches is generated from the content specific database for the first level query. The menu is organized by relevance scores assigned to the matches based on correspondence to the first level query. The menu is transmitted from the content service provider through the electronic communication network to the user.

{"@attributes":{"id":"description"},"RELAPP":[{},{}],"heading":["CLAIM TO DOMESTIC PRIORITY","FIELD OF THE INVENTION","BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION","SUMMARY OF THE INVENTION","DETAILED DESCRIPTION OF THE DRAWINGS"],"p":["The present application is a continuation of U.S. patent application Ser. No. 12\/766,720, now U.S. Pat. No. 8,452,765, filed Apr. 23, 2010, which application is incorporated herein by reference.","The present invention relates in general to electronic communication systems and, more particularly, to a system and method of controlling interactive communication services organized to efficiently and systematically respond to user queries with relevant information from content specific databases.","People use electronic communications in virtually every phase of business and personal activities. The electronic communication is conducted with telecommunication devices, e.g., computers and cellular telephones, through the Internet and associated wired and wireless communication channels and pathways. For example, electronic communication may involve sending and receiving email or text messages. While electronic communications makes the transfer of information relatively fast and easy, finding specific information of interest can still be a challenging and time-consuming process.","Consider a computer or cellular telephone user seeking information on a specific topic of interest. The user can conduct an Internet search using a web browser and search engine, e.g., Google, Bing, or Yahoo. Most search engines maintain overviews of most, if not all, publically available Internet websites on their servers. The search engine conducts a search of its servers and returns matches or partial matches to a user query. The search results are displayed as a list of websites, with potentially hundreds or thousands of hits, each with a portion of the relevant text from the website matching the user query. The search engine servers typically do not contain a complete copy of the myriad of Internet websites due to the large volume of information. The user can select one website from the list and be directed by that specific website for further information. The user must then review the content of the selected website to find the information being sought.","As most users have experienced, it may be necessary to review many different websites from the search engine listing to find the specific information of interest. Each Internet website is laid-out and organized by an administrator of the website to convey information according to purposes or business plan of the sponsoring company or organization. The website is organized for the purpose of presenting information that the sponsor is intending to convey and typically does not attempt to integrate or correlate information from other websites. The website may not be organized in a manner which is conducive or optimized to resolve the user's query. If the first website selected from the search engine list does not yield the information of interest, the user returns to the search engine listing and picks another website. The process of reviewing individual websites continues until the user is satisfied or gives up.","The logistics of finding information from mainstream Internet websites on a cellular telephone is particularly difficult due to the limited viewing area, small font and images, and manual dexterity needed to navigate what is typically formatted to be a large information space using a compact user interface. The information is difficult to see and requires substantial horizontal and vertical scrolling to comprehend the total website content. Web-based searching and information retrieval by cellular telephone is still in its infancy.","A need exists to provide interactive communication services organized to efficiently and systematically respond to user queries with relevant information. Accordingly, in one embodiment, the present invention is a method of controlling access to a plurality of content specific databases through an electronic communication network comprising the steps of compiling a plurality of content specific databases by a content service provider with each content specific database dedicated to a category of information of interest to a user, transmitting a first level query from the user through the electronic communication network to the content service provider, searching one or more of the content specific databases for the first level query, generating a first menu of matches from the content specific database for the first level query, and transmitting the first menu from the content service provider through the electronic communication network to the user.","In another embodiment, the present invention is a method of controlling access to a plurality of content specific databases through an electronic communication network comprising the steps of compiling a plurality of content specific databases by a content service provider, transmitting a first level query from a user through the electronic communication network to the content service provider, searching one or more the content specific databases for the first level query, generating a first menu of matches from the content specific database for the first level query, and transmitting the first menu from the content service provider through the electronic communication network to the user.","In another embodiment, the present invention is a method of controlling access to a content specific database through an electronic communication network comprising the steps of transmitting a first level query from a user through the electronic communication network to a content service provider, selecting a content specific database, searching the selected content specific database for the first level query, generating a first menu of matches from the content specific database for the first level query, and transmitting the first menu from the content service provider through the electronic communication network to the user.","In another embodiment, the present invention is a computer program product, comprising computer readable program code embodied in a computer usable medium to implement a method for controlling access to a plurality of content specific databases through an electronic communication network comprising the steps of transmitting a first level query from a user through the electronic communication network to a content service provider, selecting a content specific database, searching the selected content specific database for the first level query, generating a first menu of matches from the content specific database for the first level query, and transmitting the first menu from the content service provider through the electronic communication network to the user.","The present invention is described in one or more embodiments in the following description with reference to the figures, in which like numerals represent the same or similar elements. While the invention is described in terms of the best mode for achieving the invention's objectives, it will be appreciated by those skilled in the art that it is intended to cover alternatives, modifications, and equivalents as may be included within the scope of the invention as defined by the appended claims and their equivalents as supported by the following disclosure and drawings.",{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0032","num":"0031"},"figref":"FIG. 1","b":["10","12","14","16","18","14","20","22","14","24","14","14","14","16","20","24","12","18","22","14","12","18","22"]},"The electronic communication network  further includes content service provider  in electronic communication with network  over communication channel or link . Communication channel  is bi-directional and transmits data between content service provider  and electronic communication network  in a hard-wired or wireless configuration. Content service provider  retrieves relevant information from one or more content specific databases in response to query from the user.","Further detail of the computer systems used in electronic communication network  is shown in  as a simplified computer system  for executing the software program used in the electronic communication process.

The user makes a query to content service provider . The content service provider searches its content specific databases and returns relevant information based on the query to the user. For example, user  using cellular telephone  can communicate with content service provider  operating on computer , and user  using computer  can communicate with content service provider  operating on computer . The electronic communication network  is an integral part of a business, commercial, professional, educational, government, or social network involving the interaction of people, processes, and commerce.","The user first creates an account and profile with content service provider . The account set-up involves a registration process wherein the user accesses website  operated by content service provider  and provides data to complete the registration and activation process, as shown in . The user can access website  by computer  or cellular telephone  by typing the uniform resource locator (URL) for website , or by clicking on a banner located on another website which re-directs the user to predetermined landing pages for website . The data provided by the user to content service provider  may include name in block , address in block , phone number in block , email address in block , content specific database of interest in block , and other information and credentials necessary to establish a profile and identity for the user. Content server provider  maintains a number of specific databases that the user subscribes to access, either individually or in combination. For example, the content specific database may be linked to occupational topics, financial markets, social networking, political organizations, music, entertainment, horoscopes, games, food, news, weather, literature, coupons, or other special interests, just to name a few. The user profile can also contain employer, occupation, financial data, interests, associations, religion, marital status, medical conditions, and the like. Other useful information can be extracted from the source banner which directed the user to website  originally, e.g., the user was browsing a rhythm and blues music website when selecting the banner for website .

The user confirms the registration by transmitting the validation code back to content service provider . Once validated, the user's profile is stored and maintained with content service provider . Within content service provider , the user is primarily identified by his or her phone number. The phone number uniquely identifies the user and can be used for communications and billing purposes. The user can access and update his profile by entering username  and password  in login screen , as shown in . The user name can be the phone number or email address and the password assigned to or selected by the user. The user can subscribe and unsubscribe to content specific databases, change personal information, and otherwise update the profile. Accordingly, the user's profile remains secure and confidential within content service provider .",{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0041","num":"0040"},"figref":"FIG. 5","b":["80","82","84","86","88","90","26","80","90"]},"Content specific databases - are each compiled from a variety of public and private data sources to integrate and correlate information dedicated to a specific topic or category of interest to the user. For example, content specific database  is compiled by regularly reviewing a number of publically available Internet websites directed to financial markets, as well as other public and private data sources related to financial information, and organizing the information in a format that is conducive and optimized to respond to user queries. Content service provider  organizes content specific database  for the purpose of efficiently and systematically responding to a user query with relevant information, as described below. Content specific database  is further organized and updated based on historical user queries, user profiles, user groups, aggregation data, and other user input. Temporally popular topics are given priority in the search algorithm. If most historical user queries are directed to consumer interest rates, or the user has expressed interest in consumer interest rates in his or her user profile, then a user query to \u201ccurrent rates\u201d will return matches corresponding to the consumer interest rates sub-topic of financial markets with higher priority and relevance than say, bond discount rates. Content service provider  continuously reviews user profiles, learns from historical user queries, updates database contents, and adjusts the search algorithm to improve its ability to respond to user queries with relevant information.","As another example, content specific database  is compiled by regularly reviewing a number of publically available Internet websites directed to music, as well as other public and private data sources related to music, and organizing the information in a format conducive and optimized to respond to user queries. Content service provider  organizes content specific database  for the purpose of efficiently and systematically responding to a user query with relevant information, as described below. Content specific database  is further organized and updated based on historical user queries, user profiles, user groups, aggregation data, and other user input. Temporally popular topics are given priority in the search algorithm. If most historical user queries are directed to performing artists, or the user has expressed interest in performing artists in his or her user profile, then a user query to \u201cice tea\u201d will return matches corresponding to the performing artists sub-topic of music, e.g., popular rapper \u201cIce T\u201d, with higher priority and relevance than say, song lyrics that mention the drink ice tea. Content service provider  continuously reviews user profiles, learns from historical user queries, updates database contents, and adjusts the search algorithm to improve its ability to respond to user queries with relevant information.","As yet another example, content specific database  is compiled by regularly reviewing a number of publically available Internet websites directed to food, as well as other public and private data sources related to food, and organizing the information in a format conducive and optimized to respond to user queries. Content service provider  organizes content specific database  for the purpose of efficiently and systematically responding to a user query with relevant information, as described below. Content specific database  is further organized and updated based on historical user queries, user profiles, user groups, aggregation data, and other user input. Temporally popular topics are given priority in the search algorithm. If most historical user queries are directed to recipes, or the user has expressed interest in food recipes in his or her user profile, then a user query to \u201cbeef\u201d will return matches corresponding to the recipes sub-topic of food with higher priority and relevance than say, health concerns about beef. Content service provider  continuously reviews user profiles, learns from historical user queries, updates database contents, and adjusts the search algorithm to improve its ability to respond to user queries with relevant information. Content specific databases , , and  are compiled in a similar manner.","Consider an example where the user wants to make a query to content service provider . If operating from computer , the user logs in with user name and password. A query composition webpage or window  is presented for the user on computer , such as shown in . The user composes the first level query in block  and selects one or more content specific databases or vertical subjects to be searched in block  based on the stated query from block . The query typically contains text, but may also contain figures, pictures, video, and any other data content used on the Internet. In this case, the query is \u201cbeef\u201d and the vertical subject is \u201cfood\u201d in content specific database . The user can also identify one or more specific content specific databases to exclude from the search. When the user clicks search or send button , the query with selected content specific database is transmitted to content service provider  for search and response with information relevant to the first level query.","If operating from cellular telephone , the user is identified by the embedded cell phone number. The first level query is transmitted to content service provider  as short message service (SMS) text. Each content specific database maintained by content service provider  can be assigned a short code, i.e., numeric address or identifier, for ease of typing and space efficiency (SMS text limited to 160 characters). The user texts \u201cbeef\u201d to short code 77888 on cellular telephone  to query \u201cbeef\u201d for the vertical subject of \u201cfood\u201d in content specific database  to content service provider .  shows cellular telephone  with the query embodied in SMS text presented on cell phone display  to be transmitted to content service provider . Short code 77888 is an address to content database  containing the vertical subject \u201cfood.\u201d","The first level query is received by content service provider  on computer system  through direct communication or through an application programming interface (API). The query contains at least the user's phone number and search text or keywords entered in block  or as SMS text. The phone number is derived from the user login if operating from computer , or from the identifier of cellular telephone  if the query is transmitted through electronic communication network  by SMS text. The query may also contain or identify a selected content specific database. Texting the first level query \u201cbeef\u201d to short code 77888 designates content specific database  by the short code number. If the query does not include a selected content specific database, then the user profile is accessed to determine which content specific database(s) the user has subscribed to during registration or updated at a later time.","Content service provider  conducts a search within the selected content specific database. A search criteria is formulated with focus on the specific query transmitted by the user and selected content specific database. In the present case, the keyword \u201cbeef\u201d is linked to the vertical subject \u201cfood\u201d in content specific database , based on query composition window  from computer  or the keyword and short code from cellular telephone . Content service provider  also accesses the user profile in compiling the search criteria. For example, content service provider  may also have information, based on user profile , that the user is an amateur chef and knowledgeable about specialized food preparation or, conversely, that the user has limited cooking skills and prefers simple recipes. The user profile may also specify certain food preferences or food avoidances based on taste palate, health habits, religious beliefs, or medical conditions such as diabetes, high cholesterol or food allergy.","The search of content specific database  using the search criteria returns one or more matches to the user query. Each match is assigned a relevance score based on correspondence to the first level query and user profile . The relevance score can range from 0 (minimal or no relevance) to 1 (highest relevance). The relevance is computed by analyzing the closeness of the match in character-by-character comparison between the keyword and database entry, as well as values stored in the database corresponding to the preferences contained in the user profile. The closer the match in the character-by-character comparison, the higher the relevance score. The keyword and database entry comparison also takes into account partial words, abbreviations, acronyms, synonyms, and word equivalents. For example, \u201cbeef\u201d is equated to \u201cred meat\u201d, \u201cangus\u201d, or \u201csteak.\u201d A stored value indicating a complex recipe preparation lowers the relevance score for the user wanting simple dishes. A stored value indicating low sugar content of the ingredients for the recipe increases the relevance score for a person with diabetes.","The number of matches is in part related to the specificity of the keyword(s) in the first level query. A more generic keyword returns more matches; a more specific keyword or group of words returns fewer matches. The matches are prioritized by the relevance score, grouped in a menu, and returned to the user. The menu entries can be text and\/or graphical images representative of the match found in the content specific database.  shows menu  with relevant search results returned to the user and displayed on cellular telephone . Each entry in menu  is assigned a reference number. For the keyword \u201cbeef\u201d searched in the vertical subject \u201cfood\u201d of content specific database , the corresponding menu entries as determined by the search algorithm are \u201cbeef appetizers\u201d assigned reference number 1, \u201cbeef entrees\u201d assigned reference number 2, and \u201cbeef international recipes\u201d assigned reference number 3. While menu  is shown with three entries for simplicity in presentation, the menu typically has many more entries. The number of entries in the menu is dependent on the display area available to the user. Cellular telephone  has significantly less display area than computer .","The user receives menu  from content service provider  for display on cellular telephone . The user can select one of the menu entries in menu  for additional, refined searching. In this case, the user selects \u201cbeef international recipes\u201d and texts \u201c3\u201d (for reference number 3) to short code 77888. Content service provider  receives the text from the user.","Content service provider  recognizes the text \u201c3\u201d received from the user as a second level query, because of the recent first level query for \u201cbeef.\u201d A new first level query can be distinguished from a second level query as the first level query contains a new keyword, whereas a second level query contains a reference number. In the second level query, content service provider  conducts another search within content specific database  for the selected reference number, i.e., reference number 3 for \u201cbeef international recipes.\u201d As described in the first level search, content service provider  also accesses the user profile in compiling the search criteria and running the search algorithm.","The search of content specific database  using the second level query returns one or more matches.
