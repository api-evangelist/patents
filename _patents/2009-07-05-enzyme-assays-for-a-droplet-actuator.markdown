title: Enzyme assays for a droplet actuator
abstract: The invention relates to a microfluidic platform and methods of using the platform for conducting enzyme assays using a droplet actuator. The enzyme assays of the invention are useful for, among other things, identifying and/or characterizing disorders resulting from conditions in which enzymes are defective or are produced in inappropriate amounts. Enzyme assays of the invention may, for example, be used to detect altered activity of a particular enzyme in a sample, which may serve as an indicator of a particular disease. Altered activity may, for example, be caused by conditions which result in the increased or reduced production of a certain enzyme or its substrate and/or conditions which result in defective enzymes and/or substrates exhibiting increased or decreased effectiveness relative to corresponding normal enzymes and/or substrates.

This application also claims priority to, is related to, and incorporates by reference U.S. Patent Application No. 61\/078,084, entitled \u201cPlatform for Detection of Deficiencies in Enzymatic Activity,\u201d filed on Jul. 3, 2008 and U.S. Patent Application No. 61\/149,808, entitled \u201cDroplet-Based Platform for Evaluating Enzymatic Activity,\u201d filed on Feb. 4, 2009.","This invention was made with government support under HD057713, DK066956, and GM072155 awarded by the National Institutes of Health of the United States. The United States Government has certain rights in the invention.","Newborn infants are routinely tested for various genetic disorders. These tests are expensive, and typically only a small fraction of possible disorders are included in the testing regimen. At least 50 lysosomal storage disorders are rarely tested. Some of these disorders are extremely rare. Pathologies often involve significant physical and mental debilitation leading to death. Therapies are available in some cases. Outcomes may be improved with early diagnosis and treatment. Pompe disease, for example, results from a deficiency in alpha-glucosidase. Enzyme replacement therapy is available for treating the condition. However, newborns are rarely screened for Pompe.","Testing of newborn infants typically involves collecting a sample of blood from the heel of a baby. The sample is placed on a card, dried to yield a dried blood sample (DBS). The DBS is transported to a central laboratory for testing, where it is used as input for assays for several metabolic and other disorders. Using the current DBS testing methodologies, a prohibitively large volume of blood would be required in order to do a significantly larger number of tests.","There is a need for testing methods that are highly sensitive and require only a small volume of blood.","Droplet actuators are used to effect droplet operations. A droplet actuator typically includes one or more substrates configured to form a droplet operations surface or gap for conducting the droplet operations. The one or more substrates may be associated with electrodes for mediating the droplet operations. The droplet operations surface or gap is typically filled or coated with a filler fluid that is immiscible with the liquid that is to be subjected to droplet operations. There is a need in the art for techniques for conducting enzyme assays which make use of the advantages of droplet actuators.","The invention provides a method of conducting a droplet-based enzyme assay. The method may include providing liquid droplets including a sample droplet including an enzyme of interest and one or more reagent droplets including a substrate which is potentially modified in the presence of the enzyme yielding one or more signal-producing products. The droplets may be submerged in a liquid which is immiscible with the droplets. The one or more reagent droplets may include any reagents useful to produce the desired activity of the target enzyme. The method may include combining the sample droplet and the one or more reagent droplets in the immiscible liquid to yield a reaction droplet effecting an enzyme reaction in the immiscible liquid. The method may include measuring any signal produced by the one or more signal producing products. Steps in the method may be accomplished without removing the sample droplet, one or more reagent droplets, or reaction droplet from the immiscible liquid. One or more electrodes may be used to mediate dispensing of the sample droplet and\/or dispensing of the one or more reagent droplets. One or more electrodes for combining the sample droplets and the one or more reagent droplets. The one or more electrodes may be provided as components of a droplet actuator. Droplet operations may, in some cases, be mediated on a droplet operations surface and\/or in a droplet operations gap of a droplet actuator.","The reaction droplet may be divided into two or more sub-droplets. One or more electrodes may be used to mediate the dividing of the reaction droplet. One or more of the sub-droplets may be immediately combined with a quenching droplet to yield one or more droplets to assess product generation at the onset of reaction (time 0 droplets). Signal may be detected from the one or more time 0 droplets. One or more of the sub-droplets may be incubated for a predetermined period of time. One or more incubating droplets may be combined with one or more quenching droplets to yield one or more endpoint droplets. Signal may be detected from the one or more endpoint droplets. The method may include assessing modification of the substrate by the enzyme of interest based on differences in signal in the time 0 droplet and the endpoint droplet.","In some embodiments, the method includes providing multiple sample droplets including an enzyme of interest. The method may include incubating two or more of the sample droplets for different periods of time. The method may include measuring rates of reaction or endpoint signals for each of the two or more of the sample droplets. The method may include constructing a curve using the rates of reaction or endpoint signals. The method may include calculating enzyme activity based on the curve.","In some embodiments, the sample droplet used in an enzyme assay of the invention has a volume which is less than about 5000 nL; or less than about 1000 nL; or less than about 500 nL; or less than about 250 nL; or less than about 100 nL. In some embodiments, the one or more reagent droplets used in an enzyme assay of the invention each has a volume which is less than about 1000 nL; or less than about 500 nL; or less than about 250 nL; or less than about 100 nL. In some embodiments, the reaction droplet, which results from a combination of one or more of the sample droplet and one or more of the reagent droplets, has a volume which is less than about 2500 nL; or less than about 1000 nL; or less than about 750 nL; or less than about 500 nL.","In various assays of the invention, the enzyme of interest being targeted is suspected of exhibiting altered enzyme activity as compared to a corresponding normal enzyme or of being present in an amount which differs from the normal range. The method is useful for providing diagnostic information. For example, the method may include conducting an assay according to any of the methods of the invention, wherein sample droplet includes a clinical sample from a subject including the enzyme of interest; and providing diagnostic information based on the activity of the enzyme of interest from the human clinical sample. The diagnostic information may include information diagnostically relevant to a glycogen storage disease or a lysosomal storage disease. In some cases, the deficiency is in the activity of a glycosidase, such as \u03b1-glucosidase or \u03b1-galactosidase activity. In some embodiments, the assay is conducted and the diagnostic information is provided at a point of sample collection. The point of sample collection may, for example, be in the presence of, or in proximity to, a subject.","Various biological samples may be used. Examples include blood, plasma, serum, tears, saliva, and urine. Many other examples are described herein. In some cases, the clinical sample includes a dried blood sample. In some cases, the clinical sample includes a fresh blood sample.","A fresh blood sample may be collected from the subject and immediately loaded onto a droplet actuator for conducting the assay. In some embodiments, time from collection of the blood sample to providing diagnostic information is less than about 12 hours; or 6 hours. Samples may include human clinical sample or non-human animal samples.","In certain embodiments, the substrate includes a glycoside substrate. In some cases, the substrate releases a fluorophore upon contact with the enzyme of interest. In some embodiments, two or more assays are conducted simultaneously using different fluorophores for each enzyme tested. In some cases, the fluorophore includes 4-methylumbelliferyl.","The substrate may, for example, include a glycoside substrate which releases a fluorophore upon contact with the enzyme of interest. The substrate may, for example, include a glycoside substrate including glucose, galactose, fucose, mannose, sialic acid, hexose, hexosamine and\/or N-acetylated hexosamine. In some embodiments, the substrate includes a 4-methylumbelliferyl glycoside. Examples include 4-methylumbelliferyl-\u03b1-L-iduronide, 4-methylumbelliferyl-\u03b2-D-galactoside, 4-methylumbelliferyl-\u03b2-D-glucuronic acid, 4-methylumbelliferyl-\u03b1-L-fucoside, 4-methylumbelliferyl-\u03b1-mannoside, 4-methylumbelliferyl-\u03b2-D-mannoside, 4-nitrocathecol sulfate, 4-methylumbelliferyl-\u03b2-D-N-acetylglucosaminide, 4-methylumbelliferyl-\u03b2-D-N-acetylglucosaminide sulfate, 4-methylumbelliferyl-\u03b2-D-glucosaminide, 4-methylumbelliferyl-\u03b2-D-galactoside, 4-methylumbelliferyl-\u03b1-D-neuraminic acid, 4-methylumbelliferyl-\u03b1-D-N-acetylgalactosaminide, phenolphthalein \u03b2-D-glucuronic acid. Other substrates and detection modalities are described herein.","In some embodiments, the invention includes reducing or eliminating reaction contaminants associated with the substrate prior to yielding the assay droplet. This may, for example, be achieved by photobleaching the substrate prior to yielding the assay droplet. In some cases, the photobleaching is effected prior to providing the droplet including the substrate on the droplet actuator. In other cases, the photobleaching is effected after to providing the droplet including the substrate on the droplet actuator. In one embodiment, the reducing or eliminating reaction contaminants is conducted using a 4-methylumbelliferyl glycoside substrate.","In various embodiments, the droplets used in the enzyme assay are in contact with or submerged in a liquid which is immiscible with the droplets. The droplets may also, in some cases, be sandwiched in a droplet operations gap. The immiscible liquid may, for example, include an oil, such as a silicone oil or paraffin that is liquid at the reaction temperature. The filler fluid may include a surfactant. The surfactant may, for example, be a nonionic low hydrophile-lipophile balanced (HLB) surfactant. In some cases, the HLB of the surfactant is less than about 10 or less than about 5. Examples of suitable surfactants include Triton X-15; Span 85; Span 65; Span 83; Span 80; Span 60; and fluorinated surfactants.","In some embodiments, the sample droplet includes a reconstituted blood sample. In multiplexing applications, the blood sample may be reconstituted using a single universal reconstitution solution, and the blood sample is divided to yield two or more reaction droplets. Two or more of the reaction droplets may each be combined with one or more sets of one or more reagent droplets, each such set including reagents selected for establishing reaction conditions for a different enzyme assay. The universal reconstitution solution may, for example, be a saline solution or water, or any other solution which includes components that do not sufficiently interfere with any of the intended enzyme reactions to render such reactions unsuited for their intended purpose, e.g., diagnosis or screening for an enzyme disorder. Each of two or more sample droplets with reagent droplets are selected for establishing reaction conditions for a different enzyme assay. In some embodiments, the sample droplets include fresh blood and\/or reconstituted blood spot; a dried blood spot reconstituted in water; a dried blood spot reconstituted in a saline solution; a dried blood spot reconstituted in a buffer; and\/or dried blood spot reconstituted in a solution including a surfactant. The surfactant may, for example, have an HLB in the range of about 10 to about 20 or about 15 to about 20. In some cases the multiplexed sample droplets are from the same subject; in other cases, the sample droplets are from different subjects. In some cases the multiplexed enzyme reactions include reactions with conditions suitable for screening or testing for Pompe, Niemann-Pick, Fabry, Krabbe, Maroteaxu-Lamy, Hunter, Hurler, and Gaucher.","Where a dried blood spot is used, the sample droplet is prepared by reconstituting a dried blood spot disc. In some cases, the disc has a diameter of less than about 10 mm and is reconstituted in less than about 1000 \u03bcL of solution; or less than about 750 \u03bcL of solution; or less than about 500 \u03bcL of solution; or less than about 250 \u03bcL of solution; or ranging from about 25 \u03bcL to about 750 \u03bcL; or ranging from about 25 \u03bcL to about 500 \u03bcL; or ranging from about 25 \u03bcL to about 250 \u03bcL; or ranging from about 25 \u03bcL to about 150 \u03bcL. In some cases, the sample is dispensed into at least 5 sample droplets; or at least 10 sample droplets; or at least 25 sample droplets; or at least 40 sample droplets. In some cases, the dried blood spot disc has a diameter ranging from about 1 mm to about 15 mm; or from about 1 mm to about 8 mm; or from about 1 mm to about 6 mm; or from about 1 mm to about 4 mm. The disc is prepared by depositing blood on a substrate. In one embodiment, the dried blood spot is made using less than about 10 mL of blood or less than about 1 mL of blood or less than about 100 \u03bcL. In some cases, the blood is from a newborn human infant, including a premature human infant, or the blood is from a laboratory animal or even adult humans for epidemiological studies.","The enzyme assay may be used provide diagnostic information about an enzyme deficiency. For example, the enzyme deficiency may include one or more lysosomal storage diseases, such as Pompe, Niemann-Pick, Fabry, Hunter, Hurler, Maroteaux-Lamy, Krabbe, and Gaucher. Other lysosomal storage and glycogen storage diseases are described and\/or listed herein. The method may include providing therapeutic treatment to a subject based on the screening and subsequent diagnostic information. In some cases, the enzyme assay is used to test enzymes from cultured cells and\/or supernatant from a cell culture.","These and many other aspects of the invention will be apparent in the ensuing discussion.","As used herein, the following terms have the meanings indicated.","\u201cActivate\u201d with reference to one or more electrodes means effecting a change in the electrical state of the one or more electrodes which, in the presence of a droplet, results in a droplet operation.","\u201cBead,\u201d with respect to beads on a droplet actuator, means any bead or particle that is capable of interacting with a droplet on or in proximity with a droplet actuator. Beads may be any of a wide variety of shapes, such as spherical, generally spherical, egg shaped, disc shaped, cubical and other three dimensional shapes. The bead may, for example, be capable of being transported in a droplet on a droplet actuator or otherwise configured with respect to a droplet actuator in a manner which permits a droplet on the droplet actuator to be brought into contact with the bead, on the droplet actuator and\/or off the droplet actuator. Beads may be manufactured using a wide variety of materials, including for example, resins, and polymers. The beads may be any suitable size, including for example, microbeads, microparticles, nanobeads and nanoparticles. In some cases, beads are magnetically responsive; in other cases beads are not significantly magnetically responsive. For magnetically responsive beads, the magnetically responsive material may constitute substantially all of a bead or one component only of a bead. The remainder of the bead may include, among other things, polymeric material, coatings, and moieties which permit attachment of an assay reagent. Examples of suitable magnetically responsive beads include flow cytometry microbeads, polystyrene microparticles and nanoparticles, functionalized polystyrene microparticles and nanoparticles, coated polystyrene microparticles and nanoparticles, silica microbeads, fluorescent microspheres and nanospheres, functionalized fluorescent microspheres and nanospheres, coated fluorescent microspheres and nanospheres, color dyed microparticles and nanoparticles, magnetic microparticles and nanoparticles, superparamagnetic microparticles and nanoparticles (e.g., DYNABEADS\u00ae particles, available from Invitrogen Corp., Carlsbad, Calif.), fluorescent microparticles and nanoparticles, coated magnetic microparticles and nanoparticles, ferromagnetic microparticles and nanoparticles, coated ferromagnetic microparticles and nanoparticles, and those described in U.S. Patent Publication No. 20050260686, entitled, \u201cMultiplex flow assays preferably with magnetic particles as solid phase,\u201d published on Nov. 24, 2005, the entire disclosure of which is incorporated herein by reference for its teaching concerning magnetically responsive materials and beads.

For example, a droplet may be completely surrounded by filler fluid or may be bounded by filler fluid and one or more surfaces of the droplet actuator. Droplets may, for example, be aqueous or non-aqueous or may be mixtures or emulsions including aqueous and non-aqueous components. Droplets may take a wide variety of shapes; nonlimiting examples include generally disc shaped, slug shaped, truncated sphere, ellipsoid, spherical, partially compressed sphere, hemispherical, ovoid, cylindrical, and various shapes formed during droplet operations, such as merging or splitting or formed as a result of contact of such shapes with one or more surfaces of a droplet actuator. For examples of droplet fluids that may be subjected to droplet operations using the approach of the invention, see International Patent Application No. PCT\/US 06\/47486, entitled, \u201cDroplet-Based Biochemistry,\u201d filed on Dec. 11, 2006. In various embodiments, a droplet may include a biological sample, such as whole blood, blood cells, chorionic villus cells, lymphatic fluid, serum, plasma, sweat, tear, saliva, sputum, cerebrospinal fluid, amniotic fluid, seminal fluid, vaginal excretion, serous fluid, synovial fluid, pericardial fluid, peritoneal fluid, pleural fluid, transudates, exudates, cystic fluid, bile, urine, gastric fluid, intestinal fluid, fecal samples, liquids containing single or multiple cells, liquids containing organelles, fluidized tissues, fluidized organisms, liquids containing multi-celled organisms, biological swabs and biological washes.

Other examples of droplet contents include reagents, such as a reagent for a biochemical protocol, such as a nucleic acid amplification protocol, an affinity-based assay protocol, an enzyme assay protocol, a sequencing protocol, and\/or a protocol for analyses of biological fluids.","\u201cDroplet Actuator\u201d means a device for manipulating droplets. For examples of droplet actuators, see U.S. Pat. No. 6,911,132, entitled \u201cApparatus for Manipulating Droplets by Electrowetting-Based Techniques,\u201d issued on Jun. 28, 2005 to Pamula et al.; U.S. patent application Ser.

No. 20050179746, entitled \u201cDevice for Controlling the Displacement of a Drop Between two or Several Solid Substrates,\u201d published on Aug. 18, 2005; the disclosures of which are incorporated herein by reference. Certain droplet actuators will include a substrate, droplet operations electrodes associated with the substrate, one or more dielectric and\/or hydrophobic layers atop the substrate and\/or electrodes forming a droplet operations surface, and optionally, a top substrate separated from the droplet operations surface by a gap. One or more reference electrodes may be provided on the top and\/or bottom substrates and\/or in the gap. In various embodiments, the manipulation of droplets by a droplet actuator may be electrode mediated, e.g., electrowetting mediated or dielectrophoresis mediated or Coulombic force mediated. Examples of other methods of controlling fluid flow that may be used in the droplet actuators of the invention include devices that induce hydrodynamic fluidic pressure, such as those that operate on the basis of mechanical principles (e.g. external syringe pumps, pneumatic membrane pumps, vibrating membrane pumps, vacuum devices, centrifugal forces, piezoelectric\/ultrasonic pumps and acoustic forces); electrical or magnetic principles (e.g. electroosmotic flow, electrokinetic pumps, ferrofluidic plugs, electrohydrodynamic pumps, attraction or repulsion using magnetic forces and magnetohydrodynamic pumps); thermodynamic principles (e.g. gas bubble generation\/phase-change-induced volume expansion); other kinds of surface-wetting principles (e.g. electrowetting, and optoelectrowetting, as well as chemically, thermally, structurally and radioactively induced surface-tension gradients); gravity; surface tension (e.g., capillary action); electrostatic forces (e.g., electroosmotic flow); centrifugal flow (substrate disposed on a compact disc and rotated); magnetic forces (e.g., oscillating ions causes flow); magnetohydrodynamic forces; and vacuum or pressure differential. In certain embodiments, combinations of two or more of the foregoing techniques may be employed in droplet actuators of the invention.","\u201cDroplet operation\u201d means any manipulation of a droplet on a droplet actuator. A droplet operation may, for example, include: loading a droplet into the droplet actuator; dispensing one or more droplets from a source droplet; splitting, separating or dividing a droplet into two or more droplets; transporting a droplet from one location to another in any direction; merging or combining two or more droplets into a single droplet; diluting a droplet; mixing a droplet; agitating a droplet; deforming a droplet; retaining a droplet in position; incubating a droplet; heating a droplet; vaporizing a droplet; cooling a droplet; disposing of a droplet; transporting a droplet out of a droplet actuator; other droplet operations described herein; and\/or any combination of the foregoing. The terms \u201cmerge,\u201d \u201cmerging,\u201d \u201ccombine,\u201d \u201ccombining\u201d and the like are used to describe the creation of one droplet from two or more droplets. It should be understood that when such a term is used in reference to two or more droplets, any combination of droplet operations that are sufficient to result in the combination of the two or more droplets into one droplet may be used. For example, \u201cmerging droplet A with droplet B,\u201d can be achieved by transporting droplet A into contact with a stationary droplet B, transporting droplet B into contact with a stationary droplet A, or transporting droplets A and B into contact with each other. The terms \u201csplitting,\u201d \u201cseparating\u201d and \u201cdividing\u201d are not intended to imply any particular outcome with respect to volume of the resulting droplets (i.e., the volume of the resulting droplets can be the same or different) or number of resulting droplets (the number of resulting droplets may be 2, 3, 4, 5 or more). The term \u201cmixing\u201d refers to droplet operations which result in more homogenous distribution of one or more components within a droplet. Examples of \u201cloading\u201d droplet operations include microdialysis loading, pressure assisted loading, robotic loading, passive loading, and pipette loading. Droplet operations may be electrode-mediated. In some cases, droplet operations are further facilitated by the use of hydrophilic and\/or hydrophobic regions on surfaces and\/or by physical obstacles.","\u201cFiller fluid\u201d means a fluid associated with a droplet operations substrate of a droplet actuator, which fluid is sufficiently immiscible with a droplet phase to render the droplet phase subject to electrode-mediated droplet operations. The filler fluid may, for example, be a low-viscosity oil, such as silicone oil. Other examples of filler fluids are provided in International Patent Application No. PCT\/US2006\/047486, entitled, \u201cDroplet-Based Biochemistry,\u201d filed on Dec. 11, 2006; International Patent Application No. PCT\/US2008\/072604, entitled \u201cUse of additives for enhancing droplet actuation,\u201d filed on Aug. 8, 2008; and U.S. Patent Publication No. 20080283414, entitled \u201cElectrowetting Devices,\u201d filed on May 17, 2007; the entire disclosures of which are incorporated herein by reference. The filler fluid may fill the entire gap of the droplet actuator or may coat one or more surfaces of the droplet actuator. Filler fluid may be conductive or non-conductive.","\u201cImmobilize\u201d with respect to magnetically responsive beads, means that the beads are substantially restrained in position in a droplet or in filler fluid on a droplet actuator. For example, in one embodiment, immobilized beads are sufficiently restrained in position to permit execution of a splitting operation on a droplet, yielding one droplet with substantially all of the beads and one droplet substantially lacking in the beads.","\u201cMagnetically responsive\u201d means responsive to a magnetic field. \u201cMagnetically responsive beads\u201d include or are composed of magnetically responsive materials. Examples of magnetically responsive materials include paramagnetic materials, ferromagnetic materials, ferrimagnetic materials, and metamagnetic materials. Examples of suitable paramagnetic materials include iron, nickel, and cobalt, as well as metal oxides, such as FeO, BaFeO, CoO, NiO, MnO, CrO, and CoMnP.","\u201cWashing\u201d with respect to washing a magnetically responsive bead means reducing the amount and\/or concentration of one or more substances in contact with the magnetically responsive bead or exposed to the magnetically responsive bead from a droplet in contact with the magnetically responsive bead. The reduction in the amount and\/or concentration of the substance may be partial, substantially complete, or even complete. The substance may be any of a wide variety of substances; examples include target substances for further analysis, and unwanted substances, such as components of a sample, contaminants, and\/or excess reagent. In some embodiments, a washing operation begins with a starting droplet in contact with a magnetically responsive bead, where the droplet includes an initial amount and initial concentration of a substance. The washing operation may proceed using a variety of droplet operations. The washing operation may yield a droplet including the magnetically responsive bead, where the droplet has a total amount and\/or concentration of the substance which is less than the initial amount and\/or concentration of the substance. Examples of suitable washing techniques are described in Pamula et al., U.S. Pat. No. 7,439,014, entitled \u201cDroplet-Based Surface Modification and Washing,\u201d granted on Oct. 21, 2008, the entire disclosure of which is incorporated herein by reference.","The terms \u201ctop,\u201d \u201cbottom,\u201d \u201cover,\u201d \u201cunder,\u201d and \u201con\u201d are used throughout the description with reference to the relative positions of components of the droplet actuator, such as relative positions of top and bottom substrates of the droplet actuator. It will be appreciated that the droplet actuator is functional regardless of its orientation in space.","When a liquid in any form (e.g., a droplet or a continuous body, whether moving or stationary) is described as being \u201con\u201d, \u201cat\u201d, or \u201cover\u201d an electrode, array, matrix or surface, such liquid could be either in direct contact with the electrode\/array\/matrix\/surface, or could be in contact with one or more layers or films that are interposed between the liquid and the electrode\/array\/matrix\/surface.","When a droplet is described as being \u201con\u201d or \u201cloaded on\u201d a droplet actuator, it should be understood that the droplet is arranged on the droplet actuator in a manner which facilitates using the droplet actuator to conduct one or more droplet operations on the droplet, the droplet is arranged on the droplet actuator in a manner which facilitates sensing of a property of or a signal from the droplet, and\/or the droplet has been subjected to a droplet operation on the droplet actuator.","The invention relates to a microfluidic platform and methods of using the platform for conducting enzyme assays using a droplet actuator. The enzyme assays of the invention are useful for, among other things, identifying and\/or characterizing disorders resulting from conditions in which enzymes are defective or are produced in inappropriate amounts. Enzyme assays of the invention may, for example, be used to detect altered activity of a particular enzyme in a sample, which may serve as an indicator of a particular disease. Altered activity may, for example, be caused by conditions which result in the increased or reduced production of a certain enzyme or its substrate and\/or conditions which result in defective enzymes and\/or substrates exhibiting increased or decreased effectiveness relative to corresponding normal enzymes and\/or substrates.","In some cases, the enzyme assays of the invention are useful for screening inherited metabolic disorders, such as lysosomal storage diseases (LSD). In some embodiments, the microfluidic platform of the invention is configured for multiplexed detection of enzymatic disorders, such as lysosomal storage diseases (LSD). For example, in some cases, a single input sample, such as a blood droplet or a reconstituted blood droplet, may be loaded onto a droplet actuator of the invention, the sample may be dispensed into multiple sub-samples, and each of the sub-samples may be used to conduct an enzyme assay of the invention using droplet operations on the droplet actuator. In one embodiment, a single droplet actuator is configured to assay for 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10, 20, 30, 40, 50 or more enzymatic conditions. In another embodiment, multiple samples from multiple subjects may be tested on a single droplet actuator for one or more conditions. In one embodiment, a single droplet actuator is configured to conduct assays using samples from 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10, 20, 30, 40, 50 or more subjects.","The enzyme assays of the invention may have various advantages over conventional methods. As compared to the existing state of the art, the methods and platform of the invention may be used to conduct more assays per unit volume of sample. Small reaction volumes may permit assays to be completed more quickly, relative to existing techniques. The platform of the invention may be small and portable, facilitating testing in proximity to the subject, as compared to existing techniques which require shipment of samples to a central laboratory.","7.1 Droplet Actuator","In some cases, the assays of the invention are performed using a droplet actuator. A variety of droplet actuator layouts will be suitable.",{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0056","num":"0055"},"figref":"FIG. 1","b":["105","110","110","110","110","110","110","110","110","110","110","145","110","130","135","145","140","122","145","122","110","130","135","145","105","105","110","145","110","130","110","135","110"]},"In some high-throughput operations it may be useful to conform droplet actuators to conform to the SBS standard microtiter plate footprint and pitch, so that the droplet actuators will be compatible with existing robotic plate-handling equipment.

The droplet actuator includes 96 sample inlets in sets of 24 reservoirs. Each of the 24 reservoirs is set apart in a 384-well plate pitch so that a technician can easily load these reservoirs with DBS extracts from a 96-well plate using a 8-channel pipettor and laterally translating three times to load each set of 24 wells out of the 96 sample reservoirs. The droplet actuator also includes reagent reservoirs (one reservoir for each respective 4-MU substrate), sample reservoirs A, a stop buffer reservoir C and waste reservoir D. A wash reservoir (not shown) may also be provided. For high throughput operation in a newborn screening setting, the droplet actuator design may be scaled to conform to the SBS standard microtiter plate footprint and pitch, so that the droplet actuators will be compatible with existing robotic plate-handling equipment. For example, in the embodiment shown, each reservoir is placed on a 4.5 mm grid (well-to-well pitch in a 384-well plate). The reservoirs  are connected together by a grid of electrodes capable of dispensing droplets from and to the reservoirs, transporting droplets to and from reservoirs  and detection zones, and incubating the 288 assays at one time. The droplet actuator is divided into 2 halves. Each half is identical to the other half. Each half has two sets of 24 sample reservoirs (total 48 reservoirs in each half), 3 reagent reservoirs and real-estate to park or incubate 24\u00d76 reactions (144 simultaneous reactions in each half for a total of 288 reactions). The reagent reservoirs are connected by a common \u2018bus\u2019 which can be used to transport droplets from one half to the other or simply each half can have its own set of 6 reservoirs which means the technician has to load the reagents twice. Since there are only 144 incubation spots in each half, only 24 samples can be reacted with 6 substrates at any time. In each half, after the first set of 24 samples may be assayed, the next set of 24 samples is setup with its respective substrates. Therefore, two sets of reactions are conducted in series where each set of reaction contains 288 individual reactions. The architecture also has a dedicated area for detection using a multi-channel fluorimeter and a spot for measuring absorbance. This parallel architecture can readily be scaled to 384 reservoirs or larger by reducing the size of the electrodes and\/or by increasing the size of the droplet actuator.","In operation sample droplets may be merged using droplet operations with their respective reagent droplets and set for incubation in the long vertical pathways which serve as incubation zones. After incubation, the droplets may be transported into proximity with the optical detectors, first through an absorbance zone and then to a fluorescence spot. A stop buffer droplet will be dispensed and mixed with each of the incubated droplets just before reaching the fluorescence spot. Reaction droplets may be trailed by one or more wash droplets to clean up the fluorescence detection spot of any potential left-over material. In the embodiment illustrated in , each set of 24 reservoirs has its own optical detection zones.","Droplet actuator systems may take on a wide variety of configurations. For the purpose of illustration only, one such configuration includes an electrical controller, which has a microprocessor and switching circuitry to control 108 high-voltage electrical I\/Os. 8 digital I\/O pins can be used for detecting the presence and unique identification of the cartridge to allow traceability back to manufacturing records. The electrical interface may include spring-loaded connector pins to make electrical contact with the droplet actuator. Controllers and software may be used to switch 108 high voltage channels independently. Impedance detection may be implemented in the controller hardware so that any microfluidic failures such as an unresponsive droplets can be detected, and other droplets can be routed around it. In some cases, firmware in the microprocessor on-board the instrument may be used to handle sequences for switching, detection, data capture, storage, and communication.","Typically, sample and reagent may be loaded through reservoirs associated with the droplet actuator. As noted, the reservoirs are ideally spaced apart in a 384-well plate pitch of 4.5 mm to make them compatible with existing punch devices and robotics. However, such spacing is not required. Reservoirs are typically sized to permit dispensing 10's to 1000's of droplets in the droplet operations gap without requiring refilling. Larger reservoirs are useful for holding and dispensing the stop buffer and wash buffer. Stop buffer may also be used as a wash buffer or as a blank for absorbance measurements. Lower capacity reservoirs may typically be used for samples (\u02dc6 droplets) and medium capacity reservoirs may typically be used for reagents (\u02dc96 droplets). Again, these dimensions are illustrative only, and it will be appreciated that changes in configuration will be apparent to the skilled artisan in light of this specification. For example, in a droplet actuator conducting a larger number of tests per subject, a larger sample reservoir may be provided. Examples of suitable reservoir arrangements are described in Pollack et al., International Patent Pub. No. WO\/2008\/124846, entitled \u201cDroplet Dispensing Device and Methods,\u201d published on Oct. 16, 2008; and Srinivasan et al., International Patent Pub. No. WO\/2009\/032863, entitled \u201cDroplet Actuator with Improved Top Substrate,\u201d published on Mar. 12, 2009; the entire disclosures of which are incorporated herein by reference. The top substrate may be made from any suitable material. Common examples include machined plastic and glass or injection molded plastic. The bottom substrate is commonly printed circuit board or a silicon chip including electrodes, wires and contact pads, though any material suitable for forming and wiring the electrodes may be used.","7.2 Sample","The enzyme assays of the invention make use of sample droplets and substrate droplets. Sample droplets are blood or blood-derived samples, such as plasma, serum, tissue, cell fractions, and treated, fractionated, concentrated and\/or diluted forms of the foregoing. For example, diagnosis for Pompe disease is performed on fibroblasts. Other biological fluids may be used as samples; nonlimiting examples include tears, semen, urine, saliva, amniotic liquid and cerebrospinal fluid. For example, in the testing to diagnose Fabry disease, tears may be used as the input sample droplet. Still other examples of biological fluids are listed hereinbelow. Biological fluids may be treated as necessary to prepare them for being subjected to the protocols of the invention. For example, samples may be diluted or buffered, heated or cooled; pH may be adjusted; and\/or blood samples may be treated with one or more anticoagulants. Samples may be loaded into a reservoir associated with a droplet actuator, and may be dispensed into one or more subsamples. In some cases, the subsamples are unit-sized subsamples. The subsamples may be in contact with or surrounded with one or more filler fluids.","In one embodiment, the sample includes a reconstituted dried blood spot. Typically the subject's skin is pricked using a sterile puncture device, such as a lancet. Droplets of blood are spotted onto filter paper and allowed to dry. The filter paper may, for example, be a Whatman Neonatal Screening Card, such as the Whatman 903 Neonatal Blood Collection Card (available from GE Healthcare, Inc.). To reconstitute the dried blood spots, a small disc is punched from the filter paper and placed in solution to yield a solution of reconstituted blood. The disc typically has a diameter of about 3.2 mm, though other sizes may be used. The reconstituted blood solution may be loaded onto a droplet actuator where it is subject to droplet operations for conducting one or more assays.","In some embodiments, the disc may be punched directly into a droplet actuator reservoir, such as a reservoir situated in a droplet operations gap and\/or a reservoir which is external to the droplet operations gap. The external reservoir may be associated with a fluid passage suitable for flowing reconstituted blood sample into the droplet operations gap. Fluid input reservoirs may be sized to accommodate a punch and reconstitution solution. In one embodiment, the well-to-well pitch is 4.5 mm which is sufficient to fit a 3 mm DBS punch. Reservoirs may thus be arranged to permit use of existing punchers, such as the Perkin-Elmer DBS Puncher\u2122. Since the inner surfaces of the droplet operations gap are hydrophobic, the reconstitution solution, when added in to the reservoir, will remain in the reservoir. Liquid from the reservoir containing the punch can be pulled into the droplet actuator through electric field to form droplets for subsequent enzymatic assays. Reservoirs may be associated with agitators or sonicators to effect mixing of the reconstituted samples. Any tendency of reconstituted sample to flow into the droplet operations gap, e.g., during moving or shaking of the droplet actuator, may be reduced or minimized by lowering the pressure of the liquid by configuring the reservoir to reduce the height of the liquid column in the reservoir.","In some embodiments, a disc having a diameter of less than about 8 mm is reconstituted in less than about 1000 \u03bcL of solution, the sample is dispensed into at least 10 sub-droplets, and each sub-droplet is used to conduct a different enzyme assay.

Where a dried blood spot is used, the sample droplet is prepared by reconstituting a dried blood spot disc. In some cases, the disc has a diameter of less than about 10 mm and is reconstituted in less than about 1000 \u03bcL of solution; or less than about 750 \u03bcL of solution; or less than about 500 \u03bcL of solution; or less than about 250 \u03bcL of solution; or ranging from about 25 \u03bcL to about 750 \u03bcL; or ranging from about 25 \u03bcL to about 500 \u03bcL; or ranging from about 25 \u03bcL to about 250 \u03bcL; or ranging from about 25 \u03bcL to about 150 \u03bcL.

In another aspect, less than about 0.05 mL of blood is removed from a newborn. In another aspect, less than about 0.01 mL of blood is removed from a newborn.

In some cases a droplet comprising an anticoagulant may be combined with the fresh blood sample or an anticoagulant may be mixed with the sample droplet.","7.3 Substrate","The enzyme assays of the invention make use of substrate droplets. A substrate droplet typically includes a substrate for the enzyme being tested. In some cases, however, the enzyme may be provided in the substrate droplet, while the substrate is provided in the sample droplet. In the typical embodiment, the substrate droplet includes a substrate with a detectable element. The detectable element is an element that produces a detectable signal which is modified, i.e., increased, reduced, or otherwise altered, by the activity of the enzyme.","In one aspect of this embodiment, the detectable element is a fluorophore. Examples of suitable fluorophores include, 4-methylumbelliferyl. 4-methylumbelliferyl glycosides may be utilized as substrates in the glycosidase assays of the invention. 4-methylumbelliferyl may be coupled via an alpha or beta linkage to glucose, galactose, fucose, mannose, sialic acid, hexose, hexosamine, N-acetylated hexosamine and other saccharides. The appropriate 4-methylumbelliferyl glycoside may be used as the substrate for the appropriate enzyme. For example, 4-methylumbelliferyl \u03b1-D-glucopyranoside may be used as the substrate in an assay for analysis of the activity of \u03b1-glucosidase in a sample, as indicator of Pompe disease. Similarly, 4-methylumbelliferyl \u03b1-D-galactopyranoside may be used as the substrate in an assay to analyze the activity of \u03b1-galactosidase in a sample, as indicator of Fabry disease. Further, 4-methylumbelliferyl-2-sulfate-iduronic acid (4-MU-I-2SO) may be used as the substrate in an assay with L-iduronidase to analyze the activity of iduronate-2-sulfatase (I2S).","Examples of suitable substrates include, without limitation, the following: \u03b2-secretase substrate 5, Swedish Double Mutation Sequence [HiLyte Fluor\u2122 488-Glu-Val-Asn-Leu-Asp-Ala-Glu-Phe-Lys[QXL\u2122 520]-OH];

These and other substrates are available from AnaSpec, Inc. (Fremont, Calif.). The substrates may be provided in substrate droplets of the invention.","In certain embodiments it is useful to remove contaminants from the substrate droplet, e.g., by photobleaching or otherwise purifying the droplet to remove contaminants prior to the assay reaction. The inventors have found that a reaction contaminant present in the 4-methylumbelliferyl preparation extends the time required for conducting the assay. Contaminant removal, e.g., by photobleaching of the reagent, appears to reduce or eliminate the impact of the reaction contaminant(s), resulting in reduced, preferably greatly reduced, reaction time. For example, the 4-methylumbelliferyl glycoside substrate may be photobleached prior to the assay reaction. For example, in some cases the photobleaching step decreases the reaction time from about 22 hours to about 30 minutes.","Reagent solution including substrate may be loaded into a reservoir associated with a droplet actuator, and may be dispensed into one or more sub-droplets. In some cases, the sub-droplets are unit-sized subsamples. The sub-droplets may be in contact with or surrounded with one or more filler fluids.","7.4 Quench Solution","In some cases, it may be helpful to quench the enzyme reaction prior to detection. Examples of quenching solutions include those which stop the enzyme reaction without causing undue damage to the droplet actuator or without causing undue interference with the signal. \u201cUndue damage\u201d in this context is damage that renders the droplet actuator unfit for its intended purpose. \u201cUndue interference\u201d in this context is interference which renders the signal unsuited for its intended purpose. Typical quenching droplets include acidic or alkaline droplets having a pH selected to quench the reaction without causing undue damage to the droplet actuator or without causing undue interference with the signal. Quenching may also be effected by temperature changes. For example, the droplet may be transported into a zone of the droplet actuator having a temperature selected to quench the reaction. In another example, the temperature of the droplet actuator may be adjusted to quench some or all reactions occurring thereon. In some cases, the termination buffer has an additional benefit of increasing the fluorescent signal of the product. Metalloenzymes may also be quenched or deactivated by the addition of a metal chelator such as EDTA or EGTA.","7.5 Enzyme Assays","The enzyme assays of the invention are accomplished using sample droplets and substrate droplets. A droplet actuator may be employed for conducting the assays using one or more droplet operations. Sample droplets and substrate droplets may be dispensed using droplet operations on a droplet actuator. Sample droplets and substrate droplets may be combined using droplet operations on a droplet actuator using droplet operations to yield one or more reaction droplets. Reaction droplets may be mixed using droplet operations on the droplet actuator. Reaction droplets may be incubated using droplet operations on the droplet actuator. Reaction droplets may be transported into a detection window and subjected to detection on a droplet actuator.","Various aspects of the invention are based on a series of surprising discoveries made by the inventors. Reagents (e.g., enzymes and substrates) required to effect enzyme assays may withstand the droplet operations conditions required for conducting enzyme assays on a droplet actuator. Reagents may be subjected to droplet operations in which the droplets are in contact with an immiscible filler fluid. The reactions may be conducted under such conditions using tiny reaction volumes, which are only a fraction of the reaction volumes used in currently available techniques, while still producing sufficient signal to provide accurate results. Signals from such droplets may be generated and reliably detected even in the presence of the filler fluid. Signals may be reliably detected even in embodiments in which they must travel through the reaction droplet, through one or more layers of filler fluid, and through a droplet actuator substrate, such as a transparent top substrate or a transparent detection window in a top substrate. The tiny volumes of sample and reagent used in the reactions of the invention may also enhance the speed of enzyme assays, allowing them to be conducted in a fraction of the time required using conventional methods.","The enzyme assays of the invention may be combined with other assay types. For example, an enzyme assay may be conducted on a sample for a certain disorder, and depending on the outcome of the enzyme assay, further assays, such as immunoassays, may be conducted to confirm or contradict the finding from the enzyme assay. In one example, an enzyme assay may be conducted on a sample for a certain metabolic disorder, and where results indicate a level of risk within a predetermined range, genetic material from the same sample source may be subjected to a PCR and\/or nucleic acid sequencing protocol to confirm or deny the outcome from the enzyme assay. In some cases, the enzyme assay and genetic assay may be performed on the same droplet actuator. In other cases, a system may be programmed to load sample and conduct the genetic assay on a separate droplet actuator depending on the outcome of the enzyme assay.","In the assays of the invention, sample droplets and substrate droplets for use in conducting the enzyme assays may be dispensed and\/or combined according to appropriate assay protocols using droplet operations on a droplet actuator. Incubation of assay droplets, including temperature adjustments as needed, may also be performed on a droplet actuator. Detection of signals from assay droplets, such as detection of fluorescence, may be conducted while the droplet is present on the droplet actuator. The droplet operations and detection steps may be conducted while the droplet is partially or completely surrounded by a filler fluid on the droplet actuator.","In certain embodiments, certain assay steps may be conducted outside of a droplet actuator and certain assay steps may be conducted on a droplet actuator. For example, in some embodiments, sample and reagents may be combined outside the droplet actuator and an incubation and detection steps may be effected on the droplet actuator. In other embodiments, certain assay steps may be performed using droplet operations on the droplet actuator, and reaction droplets may be removed from the droplet actuator for conducting certain additional steps, such as detection.","In certain embodiments, assay droplets may be combined with one or more buffer droplets, acidic droplets and\/or basic droplets, in order to achieve a desired pH for conducting the enzyme assay of the invention. The enzyme assays are generally conducted at neutral to acidic pH. Some of the enzymatic assays described in the substrate section are performed at alkaline pH.","In one example, droplet operations may be utilized to combine on a droplet actuator the substrate droplet with a sample droplet. The droplets are provided at an appropriate pH, and the pH may be adjusted as needed by combining the sample, substrate, and\/or sample+substrate droplets with appropriate buffer droplets. The sample+substrate droplet may then be incubated on the droplet actuator. The release of fluorophore, such as 4-methylumbelliferyl, in the droplet or the increase in fluorescence in the droplet versus time, may be measured. The measurement may take place while the droplet is on the droplet actuator, or alternatively, the droplet may be removed from the droplet actuator for the detection step. A user output may be produced showing results of the assay. Multiple assays may be conducted simultaneously in a single droplet, e.g., using different fluorophores for each enzyme tested.","The invention provides modified assays for detecting altered enzymatic activity. Among the enzyme assays which may be conducted according to the methods of the invention are those methods useful in the diagnosis of defects in glycosidases, such as lysosomal storage diseases. Enzymatic indicators of lysosomal storage diseases can be identified using droplet based assays on a droplet actuator. Assays of the appropriate glycosidase activity can be used to detect altered activity of a particular glycosidase, which may be an indicator of a particular lysosomal storage disease. A deficiency in \u03b1-glucosidase activity, for example, is a diagnostic indicator of Pompe disease. Similarly, a deficiency in \u03b1-galactosidase activity is a diagnostic indicator of Fabry disease. Multiple diseases and\/or multiple samples can be tested simultaneously on a single droplet actuator.","In some embodiments, the invention provides diagnostic techniques for metabolic disorders that result from defects in lysosomal function.

In one embodiment, the droplet actuator and\/or method of the invention is set up and or executed to assess 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10, 20, 30, 40 or more of the foregoing enzymes. The enzymes may be tested in one or more biological liquids, such as a blood sample, e.g., a reconstituted dried blood spot sample.","Enzyme assays for detecting such conditions may be accomplished in a much shorter time period as compared to assays conducted using conventional methods. For example, in certain embodiments, the incubation time required to effect diagnostically relevant results is less than about 20, 15, 10, 5, 4, 3, 2 or 1 hours. In certain other embodiments, the incubation time required to effect diagnostically relevant results is less than about 45, 30, 15, 10, 5, 4, 3, 2 or 1 minutes. Similarly, in certain embodiments, the incubation time required to effect diagnostically relevant results for lysosomal storage diseases involving defects in glycosidases is less than about 20, 15, 10, 5, 4, 3, 2 or 1 hours. In certain other embodiments, the incubation time required to effect diagnostically relevant results for lysosomal storage diseases involving defects in glycosidases is less than about 45, 30, 15, 10, 5, 4, 3, 2 or 1 minutes.","In one embodiment, a blank is formed by using droplet operations to split the reaction droplet into two droplets, combining the reaction droplet with a termination buffer to one, and immediately measuring the fluorescence of the droplet to get zero time point value. The zero time point value is subtracted from the fluorescent signal from the second droplet at a later time point to obtain the enzyme activity in the sample. In an alternative embodiment the substrate droplet is dispensed but not merged with a sample droplet. At the end of the incubation time, a sample droplet (the sample could be reconstituted from a DBS spotted with blood or it could comprise a blank DBS; in the latter case, only one zero assay would need to be run as opposed to one reaction per each blood spot DBS sample) and a termination buffer droplet are merged with the assay mix, and the fluorescence signal of the sample is measured. This method for determining the zero control accounts for non-enzymatic hydrolysis of the substrate and keeps the signal quenching materials from the sample constant between zero control and the sample. In a typical run, at least one reservoir out of every n sample reservoirs may be reserved for the zero and other controls. Hemoglobin content can vary widely between samples and may affect the reported value for the assays. As noted elsewhere herein, the method of the invention may include measuring the amount of hemoglobin in each droplet, e.g., using an absorbance method. The data collected from this measurement can be used to normalize the reported enzyme activities to a fixed hemoglobin value.","7.6 Detection","The methods of the invention include using one or more sensors for measuring droplet properties associated with the enzymatic reaction, such as physical properties, chemical properties, and electrical properties. In some embodiments, the method will include using a sensing element to detect a signal from a droplet; using a transducing element to convert output from the sensor into a signal; and transmitting the signal to a processor for analysis. The processor may convert the signal into an output recognizable to a user. The sensor element may be a component of the droplet actuator, e.g., mounted on a top or bottom substrate, positioned in the droplet operations gap, or manufactured as an integral component of the droplet actuator, e.g., an integral component of top or bottom substrates. In some embodiments, the sensor element may be exterior to the droplet actuator but arranged within the system in a manner which permits the sensor to receive a signal from on the droplet actuator, e.g., from a droplet on a droplet actuator. For example, a sensor element for sensing photons may be arranged to receive photons from a droplet on a droplet actuator. Where the system has a substrate capable of transmitting photons from a droplet, the sensor may be arranged in proximity to the substrate for sensing the photons. Where the system has a substrate not capable of transmitting photons from a droplet, the substrate may be provided with a detection window capable of transmitting photons, and the sensor may be arranged in proximity to the window for sensing the photons.","The droplet actuator and methods of the invention may make use of optical detectors. A droplet actuator and\/or system of the invention may include one or more optical sensors arranged to sense a property of a droplet on a droplet actuator. Examples of optical sensing include absorbance, chemiluminescence, and fluorescence. Optical sensors may in some cases be accompanied with an appropriate light source, e.g., for exciting fluorescence or conducting absorbance measurements. These sensors may be provided as components mounted on a droplet actuator and\/or as integral parts of a droplet actuator, e.g., using semiconductor manufacturing techniques.","Optical sensors may include various optics designed to direct optical signals, and may be coupled to various image processors for analyzing optical images. In some cases, surfaces of the droplet actuator may be modified to enhance optical sensing. For example, electrodes with reflective surface finishes may be used to facilitate optical measurements of droplets. The use of reflective electrodes increases the path length for absorbance measurements and is also compatible with reflectance spectroscopy. For auto-fluorescent substrates, such as PCB, coating a droplet actuator surface with a non-fluorescent coating can be used to provide a non-fluorescent detection zone or time resolved fluorophores could be used which will obviate the need for emission and excitation filters, and dichroic mirrors.","The droplet actuator device or system may include absorbance detection components including a light source and a photosensor arranged to permit a droplet on the droplet actuator to be transported into proximity with the light source and photosensor such that light or energy passing through the droplet can be detected by the photosensor.","The droplet actuator device or system may include chemiluminescence detection components including a photosensor (such as a photodiode, avalanche photodiode, photomultiplier tube) or photon sensor (such as a photon-counting photomultiplier tube) arranged to permit a droplet on the droplet actuator to be transported into proximity with the photosensor or photon sensor such that photons emitted by chemical species in the droplet can be detected by the photosensor or photon sensor.","The droplet actuator device or system may include fluorescence detection components including a light excitation source with appropriate filters, if necessary, and a photosensor (such as a photodiode, avalanche photodiode, photomultiplier tube) or a photon sensor (such as a photon-counting photomultiplier tube) with appropriate filters and dichroic mirrors, if necessary, arranged to permit a droplet on the droplet actuator to be transported into proximity with the light excitation source and the photosensor or photon sensor such that photons emitted by fluorescent species in the droplet can be detected by the photosensor or photon sensor.","In some embodiments, detection may be conducted at an assay endpoint. In other embodiments, kinetic assays may be employed in which the signal produced by the enzyme reaction is sampled or measured over time. For example, during a reaction, the signal produced by the enzyme reaction is sampled or measured 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10, 20, 30, 40, 50, 100 or more times during the reaction in order to generate a reaction curve. In still other embodiments, a hybrid assay may be conducted in which a sample droplet is divided into a series of sub-droplets, each sub-droplet is combined with a substrate droplet to yield a reaction droplet, each reaction droplet is incubated for a different time period followed by an endpoint measurement, and the collective endpoint measurements are used to generate a curve. The resulting curve may be used to calculate enzyme activity in the sample. The sample may, for example, be dispensed and\/or split into a series of 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10 or more sub-droplets, each sub-droplet being incubated for a different time period. In yet another embodiment, a measurement is taken at the beginning and at the end of the reaction.","In some cases, incubation is effected at a first pH, while detection is effected at a different pH. In these embodiments, the reaction droplet may be combined using droplet operations with one or more buffer, acid and\/or base droplets in order to adjust pH of the droplet to the appropriate pH for detection. In the hybrid assay described above, each reaction droplet may be incubated for a different time period followed by a pH adjustment and then an endpoint measurement. The collective endpoint measurements are used to generate a curve. It should also be noted that in reactions in which the pH changes during the reaction, it may be helpful add one or more buffer, acid and\/or base droplets to the reaction order to adjust pH of the droplet to pH suitable for continuing the reaction.",{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0101","num":"0100"},"figref":"FIG. 3","b":["1","1","1","1","2","2","1","2","3"]},{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0102","num":"0101"},"figref":"FIG. 4"},"7.7 Pompe Disease","Pompe disease is described here as a non-limiting example of an enzyme deficiency that may be assayed in accordance with the methods and devices of the invention. The disease is caused by a deficiency in the enzyme acid \u03b1-glucosidase, which is needed to metabolize glycogen. The invention provides a method of assessing acid \u03b1-glucosidase activity in a sample. Generally speaking, a droplet actuator is provided with a sample droplet and a droplet including a substrate with a detectable element, such as a fluorogenic substrate for detecting \u03b1-glucosidase. Sample and substrate may be loaded into on-actuator or off-actuator reservoirs for droplet operations dispensing of droplets into a droplet operations gap or onto a droplet operations surface. A sample droplet and a substrate droplet may be combined using droplet operations to produce a signal. The reaction droplet may be provided at, and\/or adjusted to, an appropriate pH and incubated. Typical incubation time may, for example, be between about 30 minutes and about 22 hours for assays performed on DBS extracts and between 10 seconds and 1 hour for rate kinetic reactions performed on whole blood. When sufficient signal is generated, the reaction may be quenched by adding an alkaline droplet to the reaction droplet. The signal can be detected. An output can be generated showing results of the assay.","In one example, a dried blood spot is reconstituted in about 180 \u03bcL of reconstitution buffer to yield reconstituted blood sample.

One assay according to the invention makes use of 4-methylumbelliferyl-2-sulfate-iduronic acid (acid of 4-methylumbelliferyl-\u03b1-iduronate 2-sulphate, 4-MU-I-2SO4) as a substrate. The assay is a two enzyme coupled assay where I2S first cleaves the sulfate from 4-MU-I-2SO4, then L-iduronidase cleaves 4-MU-iduronic acid to release the 4-methylumbelliferyl, generating a fluorescent signal. The assay must be supplemented with L-iduronidase, which is very expensive. The 4-MU-I-2SO4 substrate is also expensive. Generic sulfatase using 4-methylumbelliferyl-sulfate as a substrate will not work because the substrate is susceptible to hydrolysis by numerous other sulfatases in blood.","The invention also provides method which avoids the use of L-iduronidase. In this method, an antibody specific for human iduronate-2-sulfatase is coupled to magnetically responsive beads. The antibody binds the enzyme without inhibiting enzymatic activity. The reconstituted dried blood spot sample is presented to the antibody-bead. The I2S binds to the bead. All unbound material including other sulfatases and hemoglobin are washed away, e.g., using a droplet-based washing protocol. The inexpensive substrate, 4-methylumbelliferyl-sulfate, is presented to the enzyme on the beads and incubated. Sulfate is cleaved off releasing 4-methylumbelliferyl and a fluorescent signal generated. If there is any interference from the beads, then either I2S can be cleaved from the beads and the beads removed before detection or the beads with I2S can be removed after the reaction is complete but just before detection. This assay is much less expensive than the 4-MU-I-2SO4 approach because it does not require the L-iduronidase enzyme or the expensive 4-MU-I-2SO4 substrate. Time to result is also faster because the assay does not require two enzymes to work in series. Removal of hemoglobin from the assay reduces or eliminates signal quench.","The assay may be accomplished on a droplet actuator using droplet operations. For example, an reagent droplet may be supplied on a droplet actuator, the droplet comprising an antibody specific for human iduronate-2-sulfatase coupled to magnetic beads. A sample solution, such as a reconstituted dried blood spot sample or fresh blood sample, may also be provided on the droplet actuator. Sample and reagent sub-droplets may be dispensed from the source droplets and combined using droplet operations to yield an assay droplet. In the assay droplet, the I2S binds to the antibodies on the beads. The beads may be washed, e.g., using a droplet based washing protocol, to remove substantially all unbound material, including other sulfatases and hemoglobin, yielding a washed assay droplet. A droplet comprising 4-methylumbelliferyl-sulfate, may be combined with the washed assay droplet to yield a detection droplet. The detection droplet may be incubated. During incubation, sulfate is cleaved off releasing 4-methylumbelliferyl and a fluorescent signal is generated in the detection droplet. The fluorescent signal may be detected, and Hunter disease may be diagnosed based on the signal.","7.10 Multiplexed Assays On-Platform by Kinetic Method","Stock solutions of 4-methylumbelliferylglycoside substrates were prepared in DMSO at concentrations of 70-100 mM. The 4-MU glycosides were then diluted into working assay buffers specific for each glycosidase: Pompe disease (\u03b1-D-glucosidase), 10 mM 4-MU-\u03b1-D-glucoside, 6 \u03bcM acarbose, 0.1 M sodium acetate, pH 3.8; Hurler disease (\u03b1-L-iduronidase), 10 mM 4-MU-\u03b1-L-iduronide, 5 \u03bcg\/ml D-saccharic 1,4-lactone monohydrate, 0.04 M sodium citrate, pH 2.8; Fabry disease (\u03b1-D-galactosidase), 10 mM 4-MU-\u03b1-D-galactoside, 75 mM N-Acetylgalactosamine, 0.1 M sodium citrate, pH 4.6, 1% sodium taurocholate; and \u03b2-D-glucuronidase (control), 10 mM 4-MU-\u03b2-D-glucuronide, 0.1 M sodium acetate, pH 4.8. Upon completion of each assay, the enzymatic reactions were terminated with 0.1 M sodium bicarbonate, pH 10 and read for fluorescence. Punches from dried blood spots (DBS), 3 mm in diameter, were reconstituted in 150 \u03bcl water or 150 \u03bcl water with 0.1% Tween 20.","The on-droplet actuator LSD enzyme assay format was as follows. All droplet volumes were 300 nL. Reconstitute 3 mm diameter punch from one DBS in 150 \u03bcL 0.1% Tween 20. Dispense 1 droplet DBS extract and 1 droplet assay mix and merge. Split DBS extract\/assay mix into two droplets. Immediately merge 1 droplet DBS extract\/assay mix with 1 droplet termination buffer. Read fluorescence (Ex\/Em, 350\/420 nm) for zero time value. Incubate remaining 1 droplet DBS extract\/assay mix for 4 hours. Merge 1 droplet DBS extract\/assay mix with 1 droplet termination buffer. Read fluorescence (Ex\/Em, 350\/420 nm) for 4 hour time value.",{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0130","num":"0129"},"figref":"FIG. 8"},{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0131","num":"0130"},"figref":"FIG. 9"},"The 4 enzymatic assays (Pompe, Fabry, Hurler, \u03b2-Glucuronidase) were performed on a single droplet actuator. The droplet actuator was loaded with DBS samples, substrates, and stop buffer and the software was preprogrammed to run the specific protocols for dispensing, transport, and mixing the sample and substrate, incubation for 4 hrs, and then dispensing and mixing the reaction mixtures with the stop buffer and finally marching the droplets to the fluorimeter and disposing to waste reservoir. The user is only involved in loading the droplet actuator and after that, it is walk away automation.","The sensitivity of the droplet actuator platform for detecting 4-methylumbelliferyl, which is the product of the glycosidase assays used for LSD detection, was measured on two different droplet actuators. A standard curve of 4-methylumbelliferone ranging in concentration from 0.23-30 \u03bcM was prepared in termination buffer. A 300 nL droplet of each concentration was dispensed onto a droplet actuator, transported to the fluorimeter, and the fluorescence measured. The fluorescence signal from a droplet of termination buffer without 4-methylumbelliferone was subtracted from each of the standard values. The average values for the duplicate standard curves from both the droplet actuators are shown in  along with standard deviation even though the error bars can only be faintly discerned because the standard deviation of all the measurements between droplet actuators was extremely small. The limit of detection (measured as mean of 10 zero values+3 standard deviations above the mean) of 4-methylumbelliferone for the current configuration of our analyzer in 300 nL droplets is 14 nM.","One potential concern of the assay on-droplet actuator is cross contamination from one sample to another since many droplet pathways can cross each other. Droplet pathway cross over is generally minimized. For the results shown in , 3 droplets of 30 \u03bcM 4-MU were run across the fluorescence detection spot followed by a droplet with 0 \u03bcM 4-MU and this cycle was repeated 16 times in 2 cSt Silicone oil with Triton X15. The y-axis is on log scale in order to show the zero values more clearly. The fluorescence from the zero droplet does not increase after 16 runs as shown in the highlighted band. A total of 64 droplets (48 high 4-MU droplets and 16 zero droplets) were run across the detector.","Normal and diseased DBS extract were run on-droplet actuator for 4 hours.  shows the discrimination of a diseased DBS from a normal DBS. In , the first vertical bar shows fluorescence from 8 normal spots assayed with Pompe substrate, the next vertical bar shows a Pompe diseased spot run with Pompe substrate, and the next two bars show a Fabry diseased spot and Hurler diseased spot respectively run with Pompe substrate. It can be seen that the Pompe diseased spot shows reduced activity compared to the normal spots and also compared to the Fabry diseased spot and Hurler diseased spot, demonstrating the there is no cross reactivity between Pompe diseased spot and other substrates. The second vertical bar in  shows fluorescence from glucuronidase assay run with the Pompe diseased spot, which shows normal level of activity. Glucuronidase is run as a control. Similarly in , 8 normal spots, Pompe spot, Fabry spot, and Hurler spot are run with Fabry substrate. It shows reduced activity only for the Fabry spot and normal level of activity for other spots. In , 8 normal spots, Pompe spot, Fabry spot, and Hurler spot are run with Hurler substrate. It shows reduced activity only for the Hurler spot and higher level of activity for other spots.  shows about the same level of activity for all the spots where each diseased spot and 8 normal spots are run with substrate for glucuronidase. All the assays were performed for 4 hrs on-droplet actuator at room temperature. The activity in diseased spots is below the average of normal spots by at least 2 standard deviations. All the enzymatic assays will have increased activity at 37\u00b0 C. and therefore normal spots would give increased fluorescence and better separation from diseased spots. Thermal stabilization has recently been added by the inventors to an instrument with measured standard deviation of 0.17\u00b0 C. at 37\u00b0 C.","In order to increase the separation between the measured activity of normal spots and diseased spots, the following parameters were explored:","Reaction Incubation Time:  shows the fluorescence obtained from a Fabry diseased spot (same spot as shown in ) along with the average obtained from 8 normal spots reacted with Fabry substrate over an incubation time of 8 hrs. The fluorescence from a normal spot incubated for 8 hrs is separated by 9 standard deviations from that of the Fabry diseased spot as compared to a separation of 5 standard deviations for a 4 hr reaction incubation time.","Reconstitution Volume In another experiment to obtain increased signal, the reconstitution volume was reduced from 150 \u03bcL (used for results in ) to 90 \u03bcL. This would essentially lead to concentration of the enzymes in the DBS extract. The effect can be seen in  where 4 enzymatic assays were performed on a single normal spot. The signal from the 90 \u03bcL extract, denoted as \u2018concentrated\u2019, is higher than the signals from a 150 \u03bcL extract by an average factor of 1.5 (except for Hurler where it was only 1.1). This generally corresponds to the concentration factor of 150 \u03bcL\/90 \u03bcL=1.66. The droplet volume on-droplet actuator remained same at 300 nanoliters.","Pompe Diseased Spots:  shows a box plot comparing fluorescence obtained from 8 normal spots compared with that from 4 Pompe disease spots. The bars represent the minimum and maximum signals obtained while the boxes represent the fluorescence levels at 75th percentile, median, and the 25th percentile. Even with 4 hr incubation and none of the improvements suggested above, it can be noted that the diseased spots are clearly separated from the normal spots.","Discrimination of normal spots from diseased spots in population based screening may be further enhanced by controlling droplet actuator temperature, using more concentrated DBS extracts, increasing the incubation time, and\/or better assessment of background.","7.11 Enzyme Cascade Detection","The invention also provides a new enzyme cascade detection method to generate signal for ELISA and other assays on-actuator. In the current ELISA format, an enzyme, such as ALP or HRP, is conjugated to a reporter antibody or streptavidin. A substrate is delivered to the complex and a long-lived, chemiluminescent product is enzymatically produced. The novel approach of the invention makes use of an enzyme or a series of enzymes to generate a signal amplification cascade. The cascade improves the sensitivity of the detection system. As an example, the signal cascade may terminate with firefly luciferase converting luciferin to light in a \u201cflash\u201d chemiluminescence reaction.","In one example, \u03b2-galactosidase may be coupled to an antibody or streptavidin. Luciferin-\u03b2-galactoside, which is not a substrate for luciferase, may be delivered to the immuno-complex, incubated and hydrolyzed to free luciferin and galactose by the \u03b2-galactosidase. The luciferin is then delivered to the PMT where it is mixed with excess ATP and firefly luciferase. All of the luciferin is rapidly converted to light in a flash reaction. Beta-galactosidase can form 700 pmole luciferin per ng enzyme per minute which is equivalent to 7photons per second. In this method the background is very low, and unlike the currently used glow substrates, all of the assay signal may be captured in the short time of the flash reaction. This method also reduces or eliminates the currently observed contamination of long-lived glow chemiluminescent products on-actuator because of the short life time of the luciferin product. It just decays away spontaneously so washing to remove glowing products is eliminated. This system is not a signal regeneration loop like the one used in pyrosequencing.","The steps in the flash assay may be achieved using droplet operations. For example, a droplet protocol may include providing a first droplet comprising \u03b2-galactosidase-antibody or \u03b2-galactosidase-streptavidin. A second droplet including luciferin-\u03b2-galactoside, which is not a substrate for luciferase, may be combined with the first droplet to yield a third droplet. The third droplet may be incubated and hydrolyzed to free luciferin and galactose by the beta-galactosidase. The third droplet including freed luciferin may be transported using droplet operations into the presence of a sensor, such as a PMT, where it is combined using droplet operations with a droplet comprising excess ATP and luciferase (e.g., firefly luciferase). The luciferin is rapidly converted to light in a flash reaction.","The flash assay of the invention may be performed on a droplet actuator, in oil. In some embodiments, a common detection window is used for multiple assays. Where glow assays are used, microdroplets from previous reactions may create background signal that interferes with detection of subsequent droplets. The flash assay of the invention provides a means whereby multiple droplets may be processed for detection in a common detection window on a droplet actuator in a filler fluid with little or no background signal remaining between droplets. For example, little or no background signal from a previous droplet may remain in oil or in microdroplets in oil in proximity to the detection window. In some cases, background signal interference from previous droplets is substantially eliminated by using the flash procedure.","In flash assays, it may be useful to use wash droplets that include the trigger solution to clean droplet transport lanes. Electrode paths that have been used to transport the substrate may be washed by transporting one or more wash droplets across some portion or all of the same area. The wash droplets may include the flash enzyme. For example, the wash droplet(s) may include luciferase or luciferase and ATP.","As another example, acridinium ester (AE) may be used as a chemiluminescent label in a flash assay of the invention. The AE signal quickly rises to a high value, typically in less than about 10, 9, 8, 7, 6, 5, 4, 3, 2 or 1 seconds upon addition of the trigger solution. The signal decays to very low values, typically in less than about 60, 30, 20, or 10 seconds. This may eliminate contamination on the detection loop and the detection spot. However, there contamination may still be present on the wash lanes and the incubation region by free secondary antibody bound with AE which can potentially affect the subsequent assays performed on the same lane. Transporting 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10, or more droplets of the AE trigger solution over the electrodes that are contaminated with antibody bound with AE would produce chemiluminescence which would decay quickly, substantially eliminating AE contamination.","7.12 Temperature Control","The droplet actuator of the invention may include a means for controlling the temperature of the droplet actuator or a region of the droplet actuator. Among other things, thermal control is useful for various protocols requiring control of droplet temperature during incubation.","In general, thermal control may be provided in three ways: (1) thermal control of the entire droplet actuator; (2) thermal control of a region of a droplet actuator using a heater that is in contact with or in proximity (such as an infrared lamp) to the controlled region; and (3) thermal control of a region of the droplet actuator using a heater that is integrated into the droplet actuator (e.g., in the substrate comprising the path or array of electrodes and\/or in a top substrate of the droplet actuator, when present). Combinations of the foregoing approaches are also possible.","In an integrated heater approach, temperature zones can be created and controlled using thermal control systems directly integrated into the droplet actuator. Thermal control is enhanced by locating the heating elements proximate to the droplets and reducing the parasitic thermal losses between the heater and the droplet. Heating elements can be integrated into the top substrate and\/or bottom substrate of the droplet actuator, located within the droplet operations gap. Various hybrids of the foregoing approaches are also possible, e.g., partially in a substrate and partially in the gap.","Integrating heating elements onto the droplet actuator also enables the use of multiple distinct thermal zones within the droplet actuator. Droplets can be transported into a thermal zone having a temperature suitable for a particular enzyme reaction. In a multiplexing application, a droplet actuator may be provided with different thermal zones, and each enzyme reaction may be incubated in a thermal zone appropriate for the particular enzyme being tested. Similarly, quenching thermal zones may also be provided having temperatures established to slow or stop a reaction, such as an enzyme reaction, in a droplet. A droplet may be transported into a thermal zone having a quenching temperature (low or high) in order to slow or stop the reaction. Droplets can be physically transported using droplet operations temperature zones of different fixed temperatures to perform the various steps of the enzyme reaction. The droplet actuator layout is scalable, such that a droplet actuator may include a few as one heating zone up to tens, hundreds or more heating zones. In an alternative embodiment, temperature is controlled by flowing or recirculating heated filler fluid through the droplet actuator and around the droplets.","Heaters may, in some embodiments, be formed using thin conductive films. Examples of suitable thin films include Pt heater wires and transparent indium-tin-oxide (ITO). ITO provides better visualization of the droplets for real-time observation. A remotely placed conventional thermocouple (TC) for temperature regulation can also be used. In one embodiment, tiny metal (e.g., copper) vias in a PCB substrate are used to create tight thermal junctions between the liquid and the remote TC. Further, sample temperature can be determined by monitoring the copper via using a surface mount thermistor or an infrared sensor. One advantage of using a thermistor for temperature measurement is that they are small enough (2\u00d72 mm) to be soldered directly on the droplet actuator, while an advantage of using IR for heating is that it is a non-contact method which would simplify the interfacing. Because the thermal conductivity of copper is at least 700 times greater than the FR-4 substrate (350-390 W\/m\u00b7K versus 0.3-0.5 W\/m\u00b7K) the temperature of a Cu via will accurately represent the temperature inside the liquid. Heaters may be integrated on the bottom and\/or top (when present) substrate of the droplet actuator and on the bottom and\/or top surface of either substrate, or integrated within the structure of either substrate.","Heaters may be used to create a continuous temperature gradient across the droplet actuator or across a region of a droplet actuator (e.g., from 100 to 50\u00b0 C.). The use of a continuous gradient will eliminate the need to overcome the steep temperature gradients found along the edge of the heater blocks. A controlled temperature gradient may enhance the functionality of the device by allowing protocols with arbitrary numbers of temperature points to be implemented. Each enzyme reaction droplet may be transported into a region of the temperature gradient most suitable for conducting the particular enzyme reaction. The droplets will be transported to and held at the appropriate location in the thermal gradient to achieve a target temperature.","7.13 Systems","As will be appreciated by one of skill in the art, the invention may be embodied as a method, system, or computer program product.
