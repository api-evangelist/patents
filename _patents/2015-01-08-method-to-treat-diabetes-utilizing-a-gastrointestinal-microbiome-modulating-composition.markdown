Field of the Invention","The present invention relates to weigh control and metabolic fitness. More particularly, the present invention relates to compositions and methods for increasing desirable microbiota in the human gut and reducing therein undesirable microbiota to achieve a healthy glucose regulation, metabolic fitness, inclusive intestinal health, and a healthy body weight.","2. General Background of the Invention","During the past 5 years a large international effort, called the Human Microbiome Project (HMP) by the National Institutes of Health, and known more broadly as the International Human Microbiome Consortium (IHMC), is aimed at characterizing the microbes living in and on our bodies (see http:\/\/hmpdace.org\/data_browser.php). In the large intestine an estimated 100 trillion microorganisms reside that appear to play essential roles in metabolizing food, drugs, and dietary supplements that are not absorbed by the upper gastrointestinal (GI) tract. In addition, some of those microorganisms manufacture essential nutrients and vitamins necessary to sustain health. Such microbial interactions in the intestinal environment exert critical roles in signaling metabolic-, behavior-, and immune-regulatory systems of the human host.","The first GI microbiomes to be partially characterized are those obtained in the feces of obese and lean individuals (1,2). Microbiota of the Firmicutes phylum are in abundance in the feces of obese individuals when compared to that of lean volunteers. Microbiota of the other major division, Bacteroidetes, are more abundant than those of Firmicutes division in lean individuals. Thus, during metabolic diseases such as obesity and diabetes, an imbalance between these 2 dominant groups of bacteria reflecting a wealth of Firmuetes species to Bacteroidetes species (B:F ratio) is one characteristic of individuals with an unhealthy body mass. These findings are confirmed in obese and lean mice (3). Further, sterile mice can be inoculated with microbiomes obtained from human feces of either obese or lean individuals. When fed a standard mouse chow, they either become obese or remain lean depending on the source of their GI microbiota transplant (4). Mice transplanted with human GI microbiota will become obese when fed a chow rich in simple sugars and fat after several week. The B:F ratio of those mice increased when the diet is switched to one low in both fat and sugar but rich in plain polysaccharides (5,6).","Microbiota belonging to the Bacteriodetes phylum are specialists at transporting and metabolizing carbohydrates (7). They appear to forage on any available carbohydrate in their environment. Most sugars and starches, however, are metabolized by the host and are absorbed by the upper GI. Indigestible (by the host) carbohydrates do make it to the lower GI where they are consumed by members of the Bacteriodetes. The end products of this process are small chain fatty acids (SCFAs) that have health benefits for the host. Many of these indigestible carbohydrates are plant polysaccharides or more commonly called fiber or resistant starch and are classified as prebiotics (8). Microbiomes characterized in the feces of children maintained on a high fiber diet have a greater B:F ratio than those analyzed from feces of children consuming a typical European diet (9).","The follow U.S. and other patent documents are incorporated herein by reference:","US20020009436 Methods and compositions for inhibiting adhesion by microorganisms","US20040132164 Methods and compositions for inhibiting adhesion by microorganisms","US20050239706 Modulation of fiaf and the gastrointestinal microbiota as a means to control energy storage in a subject","US20070036836 Amino acid supplementation for a healthy microbiota ecosystem","US20070196890 Prebiotic effect analysis","US20080102162 Prebiotic Preparation","US20080261916 Synergistic Prebiotic Compositions","US20080274127 AMINO ACID SUPPLEMENTATION FOR A HEALTHY MICROBIOTA ECOSYSTEM","US20090142442 GUT MICROBIOTA IN INFANTS","US20090143414 Novel Composition to Improve Gut Health and Animal Performance and Methods of Making the Same","US20090170141 GHRELIN O-ACYLTRANSFERASE (GOAT) BIOCHEMICAL ASSAY","US20100048595 USE OF ARCHAEA TO MODULATE THE NUTRIENT HARVESTING FUNCTIONS OF THE GASTROINTESTINAL MICROBIOTA","US20100086527 SYMBIOTIC TO IMPROVE GUT MICROBIOTA","US20100086955 Small Molecule Inhibitors of Ghrelin O-Acyltransferase","US20100129816 Microbial Population Analyse","US20100172874 GUT MICROBIOME AS A BIOMARKER AND THERAPEUTIC TARGET FOR TREATING OBESITY OR AN OBESITY RELATED DISORDER","US20100254949 PREBIOTIC OLIGOSACCHARIDES","US20100317573 PEDIATRIC FIBER MIXTURE","US20110009359 USE OF NON-DIGESTIBLE CARBOHYDRATES FOR IMPROVING INTESTINAL MICROBIOTA","US20110034407 USE OF SPHINGOMYELIN AND NON-DIGESTIBLE CARBOHYDRATES FOR IMPROVING INTESTINAL MICROBIOTA","US20110123504 GUT FLORA AND WEIGHT MANAGEMENT","US20050239706 MODULATION OF FIAF AND THE GASTROINTESTINAL MICROBIOTA AS A MEANS TO CONTROL ENERGY STORAGE IN A SUBJECT","US20110280840 COMPOSITIONS AND METHODS FOR TREATING OBESITY AND RELATED DISORDERS BY CHARACTERIZING AND RESTORING MAMMALIAN BACTERIAL MICROBIOTA","US20120027724 METHODS OF TREATING IMPAIRED GLUCOSE METABOLISM VIA ADMINISTRATION OF ALGAL BIOMASS","US20120058094 COMPOSITIONS AND METHODS FOR TREATING OBESITY AND RELATED DISORDERS BY CHARACTERIZING AND RESTORING MAMMALIAN BACTERIAL MICROBIOTA","US20120135957 COMPOSITIONS CONTAINING MIXTURES OF FERMENTABLE FIBERS","WO\/2012\/024638A2 COMPOSITIONS AND METHODS FOR TREATING OBESITY AND RELATED DISORDERS BY CHARACTERIZING AND RESTORING MAMMALIAN BACTERIAL MICROBIOTA","WO\/2011\/107482A9 METHOD OF DIAGNOSTIC OF OBESITY","WO\/2011\/103123A2 REDUCING SHORT-CHAIN FATTY ACIDS AND ENERGY UPTAKE IN OBESE HUMANS BY MANAGING THEIR INTESTINAL MICROBIAL COMMUNITIES","WO\/2011\/022660A1 METHODS OF DIAGNOSING AND TREATING MICROBIOME-ASSOCIATED DISEASE USING INTERACTION NETWORK PARAMETERS","WO\/2008\/076696A2 THE GUT MICROBIOME AS A BIOMARKER AND THERAPEUTIC TARGET FOR TREATING OBESITY OR AN OBESITY RELATED DISORDER","WO\/2008\/076006A3 THE GUT MICROBIOME AS A BIOMARKER AND THERAPEUTIC TARGET FOR TREATING OBESITY OR AN OBESITY RELATED DISORDER","WO\/2010\/002890A2 METHODS OF PROMOTING WEIGHT LOSS AND ASSOCIATED ARRAYS","WO\/2010\/002890A3 METHODS OF PROMOTING WEIGHT LOSS AND ASSOCIATED ARRAYS","WO\/2010\/15842A2 METHODS AND SYSTEMS FOR PHYLOGENETIC ANALYSIS","EP2102350A2 THE GUT MICROBIOME AS A BIOMARKER AND THERAPEUTIC TARGET FOR TREATING OBESITY OR AN OBESITY RELATED DISORDER","Also incorporated herein by reference are the following references, which are referenced above and below:\n\n","The present invention includes a composition and use of a formulation to increase the ratio of gastrointestinal microbiota in phylum Bacteroidetes to microbiota of Firmicutes phylum.","One aspect of the present invention is to include an indigestible carbohydrate such as inulin, oligofructoses, fructo-oligosaccharides, lactulose, galcto-oligosaccharides, xylo-oligosaccharides, resistant starches, in the formula. In addition to offering food for species of Bacteriodetes and selecting for their growth, production of short chain fatty acids (SCFAs) in the colon will suppress pathogenic bacteria and viruses from invading and colonizing the GI tract, partially inhibit hepatic cholesterol biosynthesis, serve as nutrients for colonocytes, reduce colon pH, increase mineral absorption, and serve as ligands to stimulate release of peptide YY (PYY) and glucagon-like peptide-1 (GLP-1) into the blood. PYY and GLP-1 are hormones produced and released from the colon into the blood. PYY signals satiety. GLP-1 stimulates the glucose sensing ability of the insulin secreting cell, prevents that cell from apoptosis, stimulates proliferation of those pancreatic beta cells and inhibits gastric emptying. GLP-1 also stimulates satiety but this may be due to its important role in decreasing gastric emptying.","Ghrelin is a hormone secreted by the stomach that stimulates appetite. Ghrelin is unique because it must be acylated with a medium chain fatty acid (MCFA) on the 3rd residue to bind and trigger its receptor (GHS-R1a) (10). Ghrelin comprised with octanoic (C-8)- or decanoic (C-10)-MCFAs are the most common forms of active ghrelin (10). There are also circulating carboxylesterases that cleave the acyl bond linking the fatty acid to the ghrelin backbone and render ghrelin inactive (11) with respect to appetite and nutrient consumption but may be beneficial for the treatment of T2DM (12). The acylating enzyme in the stomach cell that synthesizes ghrelin was identified about 3 years ago (13,14) and is now a drug target for several groups. The enzyme termed GOAT (ghrelin O-acyltransferase), has a high affinity for MCFAs but can acetylate ghrelin with fatty acids of different lengths. Not only does GOAT prefer MCFAs, but ghrelin that is acylated with a MCFA is much more potent than ghrelin forced to be synthesized with either a small or long chain fatty acid (15). Interestingly, levels of circulating medium chain fatty acids at any time point are relatively low when compared to long chain fatty acids. This is primarily a result of diet. Modern diets and most foods are rich in long chain fatty acids. MCFAs are abundant in coconut oil and human breast milk. Short chain fatty acids (SCFAs) are also rarely in the food chain; they can be found in small quantities in butter and coconut. However, they are produced in large quantities by the microflora in the colon as a byproduct of polysaccharide consumption by the microbiota of the Bacteriodetes division. Recent evidence indicates that GOAT can use a SCFA to acylate ghrelin, rendering the hormone inactive at its receptor (16).","Thus, another novel aspect of the present invention is a formula designed to significantly enhance production or SCFAs by microbiota to serve as substrates for GOAT, render an inactive ghrelin and consequently decrease appetite.","While aspects of the present invention are aimed at increasing the population of colonic microbiota that garners carbohydrates, there is the possibility of those microorganisms redirecting their carbohydrate-harvesting activities from dietary to host polysaccharides according to nutrient availability (7). The colon mucus layer is comprises of mucins, which are glycoproteins that have O-linked oligosaccharides or O-glycans, which account for up to 80% of the mass of mucin (17). This mucus layer covers the gastrointestinal epithelium where it provides a protective layer from the rich intestinal microbiome as well as any pathogens. Such engogenous source of glycans in the microbiome habitat could offer alternative nutrients. However, when dietary glycans are present, it appears that harvesting energy from the diet is preferred (7).","Recently, evidence that bile salts are bacteriostatic to cecal microbiota was presented (24). Moreover, the data indicate that microbiota of the Bacteroidetes phylum are most sensitive to bile salts. Secretion of bile salts into the intestinal tract is stimulated by fat ingestion. Thus, ingestion of fat containing food increases bile secretion, which in turn decreases the numbers of Bacteriodetes microbiota. Viscous beta-glucan encapsulates or sequesters bile acids (25) and thus has the ability to preserve members of the Bacteroidetes, even when fat is ingested.","Thus, an important aspect of the present invention includes dietary glycans. Most are indigestible carbohydrates. Since glycans are also in abundance in yeast walls, one source of dietary glycans is from yeast. Other sources include dietary beta-glucan. Beta-glucan is a natural polysaccharide that can be isolated from oat, barley and wheat most commonly, but also from baker's yeast, certain fungi, mushrooms, and bacteria. Addition of beta-glucan is an important component of the present invention to maintain the mucosa protective barrier as well as to offer nutrients to microbiota that prefer to forage on carbohydrates and would increase the B:F ratio.","Another means to alter an imbalance between microbiota belonging to Bacteroidetes and Firmicutes phyla is to suppress the growth of members of one division. Such bacteriostatic or bactericidal actions for members of Firmicutes division are reported for a number of phenolic compounds that are present in large quantities in berries and other fruits (18). Anthocyanins are the predominating group of phenolic compounds present in berries and are especially abundant (18). A large proportion of dietary polyphenolics remain unabsorbed in the gut lumen where they become concentrated in the ileum and colon. Up to 85% of blueberry anthocyanins enter the colon (19) and appear to exert more growth suppressing effects on members of the Firmicutes division than the Bacteroidetes division (20, 21). Although blueberry powder, blueberry pomace, or blueberry extract containing such polyphenolics is preferred, the present invention preferably includes any fruit or berry ingredient preparation containing similar phenolics such as those listed in Reference 18. The three preferred classes of ingredients, fermentable polysaccharides, beta-glucans, and berry extracts, can be prepared in any type of edible product such as powder to mix in liquid, a bar, smoothie, yogurt, shake, etc. The blend may also be prepared in a capsule or compressed into a tablet. Preferably, the formulation is to be ingested twice per day in between the first and second meals as well as between the second and third meals.","It is preferred that each dose of the formulation contain at least about 4 g of indigestible polysaccharide, at least about 2 g beta-glucan and at least about 4 g of berry powder extract (the equivalent of 2 cups (16 ounces) or 0.47 liters whole blueberries containing about 800 mg of total phenolics. 100 mg of anthocyanins and 6900 \u03bcmoles TE antioxidant activity). It is preferred that the dose be administered twice per day within 1 hour prior to meal 1 or within 1 hour prior to meal 2, as well as within 1 hour prior to meal 3. These are our best estimates but the formulation may change.","Ranges of ingredients preferably include about 2-120 mg\/kg of body weight of indigestible polysaccharide, about 2-80 mg\/kg of body weight of beta-glucan and about 2-120 mg\/kg of body weight of blueberry powdered extract or any fruit or berry ingredient preparation containing similar phenolics such as those listed in Reference 18. Ranges of these ingredients more preferably include about 10-80 mg\/kg of body weight of indigestible polysaccharide, about 5-50 mg\/kg of body weight of beta-glucan and about 10-80 mg\/kg of body weight of blueberry powder or any fruit or berry ingredient preparation containing similar phenolics such as those listed in Reference 18. Ranges of these ingredients most preferably include about 20-60 mg\/kg of body weight of indigestible polysaccharide that is a fermentable fiber or resistant starch, about 10-30 mg\/kg of body weight of beta-glucan and about 20-60-320 mg\/kg of body weight of blueberry powdered extract or any fruit or berry ingredient preparation containing similar phenolics such as those listed in Reference 18. One of these ingredients in a formulation is preferable to none, any two are preferable to only one, and most preferably all three are present in a formulation of the present invention that contains less than 70 usable Calories (Cal or keal) (293 Kilojoules). The calorie or joule content of the formulation can be calculated from derived constants determined for macronutrients in the formula. However, the majority of ingredients in the formula is not digested and absorbed and thus is not assimilated or utilized for energy in the human body. A usable calorie or joule is only the calorie or joule that is assimilated or utilized for energy in the human body.","A preferred indigestible carbohydrate is inulin and can be found naturally in banana, asparagus, garlic, onions and wheat flour at low levels. To consume a sufficient quantity to achieve levels in the most preferred dose is possible but that would contribute significant usable calories or joules to the daily caloric intake of individuals who already have an unhealthy weight (see Table below) because the foods also contains usable calories or joules. Inulin content of raw Jerusalem artichoke, chicory root, and agave is high. Ingestion of a purified preparation of inulin contributes significantly less usable calories or joules to daily caloric intake than does ingestion of a vegetable containing inulin (see Table 1). To obtain the desired dose of inulin by eating the more common vegetable would contribute about 40-times the calories or joules that purified inulin contributes.",{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0061","num":"0092"},"tables":{"@attributes":{"id":"TABLE-US-00001","num":"00001"},"table":{"@attributes":{"frame":"none","colsep":"0","rowsep":"0"},"tgroup":[{"@attributes":{"align":"left","colsep":"0","rowsep":"0","cols":"1"},"colspec":{"@attributes":{"colname":"1","colwidth":"217pt","align":"center"}},"thead":{"row":{"entry":"TABLE 1"}},"tbody":{"@attributes":{"valign":"top"},"row":[{"entry":{"@attributes":{"namest":"1","nameend":"1","align":"center","rowsep":"1"}}},{"entry":"Quantity and Calorie or Kilojoule Content "},{"entry":"for Preferred Dose of Indigestible Carbohydrate"}]}},{"@attributes":{"align":"left","colsep":"0","rowsep":"0","cols":"3"},"colspec":[{"@attributes":{"colname":"1","colwidth":"84pt","align":"left"}},{"@attributes":{"colname":"2","colwidth":"70pt","align":"left"}},{"@attributes":{"colname":"3","colwidth":"63pt","align":"left"}}],"tbody":{"@attributes":{"valign":"top"},"row":[{"entry":["Ingredient","Quantity","Calories\/Kilojoules"]},{"entry":{"@attributes":{"namest":"1","nameend":"3","align":"center","rowsep":"1"}}},{"entry":["Purified Inulin","4 g","0.48\/2.01"]},{"entry":["Banana","6 bananas","630\/2,638"]},{"entry":["Raw Asparagus","1 cup (0.237 liters)","27\/113"]},{"entry":["Raw Garlic","15 cloves","60\/251"]},{"entry":["Raw Onion","10 tablespoons chopped","40\/167"]},{"entry":["Wheat Flour","1 cup (0.237 liters)","455\/1,905"]},{"entry":["Raw Jerusalem Artichoke","\u00bc cup (0.059 liters)","18\/75"]},{"entry":["Raw Chicory Root","\u00bd root","20\/84"]},{"entry":{"@attributes":{"namest":"1","nameend":"3","align":"center","rowsep":"1"}}}]}}]}}},"Beta-glucan can be found naturally in oats, barley, mushrooms and Baker's yeast.

In other cases twice daily administration of half the optimal dose is desired such as in children or the elderly. In some cases optimal twice daily dosing may be changed to a daily dosing regimen to maintain the changes stimulated by twice daily dosing. In other cases the twice daily dosing may be switched to twice daily dosing of half the most preferred dose such as in children or adults who cannot tolerate preferred dosing.","The present invention can be used in combination with drugs. For example, broad spectrum antibiotics prescribed for systemic infections are not completely absorbed by the upper GI system and make it to the microbiota environment. This will temporarily alter the GI microbiome and it may be desirable to ingest the formulation of the present invention during antibiotic therapy, in preparation for a course of antibiotics, or following such intervention. Specific antibiotics may target Gram positive or Gram negative bacteria. Treatment with a Gram positive antibiotic before-, during-, or following ingestion of the above combination of prebiotics of the present invention could improve the desired outcome. Because the formulation of the present invention is expected to increase GLP-1 levels, it may be desirable to combine that intervention with a DPP-IV (dipeptidy peptidase type IV) inhibitor such as Vildagliptin, Sitagliptin, or others in this class. This will greatly prolong the half-life of GLP-1 released from the colon and the combination would be preferred over the DPP-IV inhibitor alone or an injection of a GLP-1 peptide agonist such as Byetta. The present invention can also be combined with other diabetes interventions such as biguanides. An example includes metformin (Glucophage, Glucophage XR, Riomet, Fortamet, and Glumetza). In fact, combined use of the present invention with metformin may not only improve blood glucose regulation but will counter the diarrhea side effect often associated with metformin (see Example 5). This is a potentially important clinical observation. Metformin is recommended as the initial drug of choice for the treatment of type-2 diabetes (26). Metformin has been reported to cause a 20% incidence of diarrhea in diabetic patients taking the drug compared to only 6% of diabetic patients not taking metformin (27). In fact, diarrhea with metformin is a sufficient problem that some diabetic patients cannot tolerate the drug. Since metformin has a good safety record causes an approximate 2-3 kg weight loss and is a low-cost generic medication, increasing the tolerance to metformin while increasing its efficacy using a safe food supplement could have beneficial public health consequences. The present invention may also be combined with alpha-glucosidase inhibitors such as Precose (acarbose) and Glyset (miglitol) that are effective in controlling blood glucose but are poorly tolerated because of associated diarrhea. In addition, some drugs such as atypical antipsychotics and insulin cause weight gain in some patients. The present invention could be combined with such drugs to combat the weight gain without intervening with antipsychotic efficacy.","The present invention can be used to treat other diseases and syndromes. Irritable bowel syndrome (IBS) is a disorder characterized by abdominal pain or discomfort, and altered bowel habit (chronic or recurrent diarrhea, constipation, or both\u2014either mixed or in alternation). IBS with constipation is sometimes referred to as IBS-C or constipation-predominant IBS. IBS with diarrhea is sometimes referred to as IBS-D. The key symptom of IBS is abdominal pain or discomfort anywhere in the abdomen. It may change over time. The impact of IBS can range from mild inconvenience to severe debilitation. Persons with moderate to severe IBS must struggle with symptoms that often impair their physical, emotional, economic, educational and social well-being. The exact cause of IBS is not known. Treatments are available for IBS to help manage symptoms but none appear to address the etiology. Fecal microbiota of patients suffering with IBS have a 2-fold decrease in the ratio of the Bacteroidetes to Firmicutes when compared with healthy individuals (28). Thus, the present invention that stimulates an increase in the ratio of members of the Bacteroidetes phylum to the Firmicutes phylum should be an efficacious and safe therapeutic to treat IBS.","The present invention can be used in preparation for fecal transplant or fecal bacteriotherapy and its follow up. Fecal microbiota transplantation is the process of transplantation of fecal microbiota from a healthy individual into a recipient as a treatment for diseases such as infection by (29) or more recently, type 2 diabetes (30). Guidelines for both the donor and the recipient are being prepared and will likely indicate strategies for both the donor and the recipient. The use of the present invention in preparation of both subjects for the procedure and continued use by the recipient after transplantation will increase the probability of a successful outcome. The present invention can also be used in preparation for fecal banking. Such practice will permit a subject to prepare a specific fecal sample for banking until needed. This may occur in preparation of prolonged antibiotic surgery, cancer chemotherapy and an unforeseen chronic illness.","The present invention can be used to treat ocular diseases. Recently, it was demonstrated that the microbiota of a conventional raised laboratory mouse adversely alters the ocular lens (31). The present invention is designed to cause a shift in the GI microbiome. Thus, the invention will be useful in prevention of cataracts. Another eye syndrome is commonly called dry-eye syndrome (DES). Traditionally, DES has been thought of as a deficiency of tears at the ocular surface. In recent years, however, investigators have shown that DES is much more complex than previously thought, and that \u201ctear film dysfunction syndrome\u201d might more accurately describe the condition. Tear film dysfunction can be broken down into two basic etiologic classifications: insufficient tear production or increased evaporation of tears from the eye surface (32). The tear film is made up of lipid, aqueous and mucin components. Individuals with dry eye syndrome can be deficient in any of these components and all appear to be related, in part, to healthy GI function. Thus, the present invention will be useful in treating DES.",{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0074","num":"0105"},"tables":{"@attributes":{"id":"TABLE-US-00006","num":"00006"},"table":{"@attributes":{"frame":"none","colsep":"0","rowsep":"0"},"tgroup":[{"@attributes":{"align":"left","colsep":"0","rowsep":"0","cols":"1"},"colspec":{"@attributes":{"colname":"1","colwidth":"217pt","align":"center"}},"thead":{"row":{"entry":"TABLE 6"}},"tbody":{"@attributes":{"valign":"top"},"row":[{"entry":{"@attributes":{"namest":"1","nameend":"1","align":"center","rowsep":"1"}}},{"entry":"Most Preferred Formulation with Function"}]}},{"@attributes":{"align":"left","colsep":"0","rowsep":"0","cols":"4"},"colspec":[{"@attributes":{"colname":"1","colwidth":"35pt","align":"left"}},{"@attributes":{"colname":"2","colwidth":"56pt","align":"center"}},{"@attributes":{"colname":"3","colwidth":"91pt","align":"left"}},{"@attributes":{"colname":"4","colwidth":"35pt","align":"center"}}],"tbody":{"@attributes":{"valign":"top"},"row":[{"entry":["Ingredient","Mass (g\/dose)","Function","Reference"]},{"entry":{"@attributes":{"namest":"1","nameend":"4","align":"center","rowsep":"1"}}}]}},{"@attributes":{"align":"left","colsep":"0","rowsep":"0","cols":"4"},"colspec":[{"@attributes":{"colname":"1","colwidth":"35pt","align":"left"}},{"@attributes":{"colname":"2","colwidth":"56pt","align":"char","char":"."}},{"@attributes":{"colname":"3","colwidth":"91pt","align":"left"}},{"@attributes":{"colname":"4","colwidth":"35pt","align":"left"}}],"tbody":{"@attributes":{"valign":"top"},"row":[{"entry":["Blueberry ","4.7","Weight loss, antimicrobial,","\u20021-5"]},{"entry":["extract",{},"antioxidant",{}]},{"entry":["\u03b2-Glucan","2","\u2191satiey, \u2193LDL chol,\u2191PYY,","\u20026-11"]},{"entry":[{},{},"\u2191GLP-1, \u2193ghrelin, \u2193hunger",{}]},{"entry":["Inulin","4","\u2191GLP-1, \u2191PYY, \u2191satiety, \u2193","12-15"]},{"entry":[{},{},"ghrelin, \u2193TG, Support GI",{}]},{"entry":[{},{},"Immune System"]},{"entry":{"@attributes":{"namest":"1","nameend":"4","align":"center","rowsep":"1"}}},{"entry":"\u2191indicates an increase in reported"},{"entry":"\u2193indicates that a decrease is reported"},{"entry":"TG is triglyceride"},{"entry":"\u20021.

He denied past hospitalizations, trauma with residua or blood transfusions. He had never smoked, drank 3-4 alcoholic drinks per week on average and had no history of intravenous drug use. He was a full-time law student and had no exposures to occupational toxins. During the 6 months prior to his presentation he had been sexually active with one woman. The patient's mother and father were living and well. He had one sister who was living and well, and he had no children. There was no family history of diabetes. He had no complaint other than lower back pain. On physical examination he was 104 kg with a height of 165 cm and a body mass index (BMI) of 38.3 kg\/m. His blood pressure was 116\/70 with a pulse rate of 80\/min and he was afebrile. Urinalysis demonstrated presence of glucose, that was followed up by a non-fasting capillary blood glucose of 450 mg\/dl glucose and a hemoglobin A1c of 8.8% and a microalbumin\/creatine ratio of 147. His physician made the diagnosis of type 2 diabetes mellitus based on his age, lack of acidosis and a fasting blood sugar of 375 mg\/dL. He was started on metformin 500 mg twice a day and was instructed to measure his fasting blood sugar on a daily basis. Over the course of 7 days he was instructed to increase metformin to 1000 mg twice a day. Over the course of the next 9 days he developed persistent watery stools and his fasting blood sugar decreased to about 325 mg\/dL. He knew from his contact with NuMe Health, LLC that the company was developing and testing a dietary supplement with a goal of increase insulin sensitivity through a salutary effect on the stool microbiome. On the 9th day of his treatment with 1000 mg metformin dose, he added FORMULA A taken twice a day within an hour before breakfast or lunch and within an hour before dinner.

After an additional month, he ran out of his FORMULA A for 2 days. During that period, his blood sugar increased from 100 mg\/dL to 131 mg\/dL and his diarrhea returned. After resuming FORMULA A his blood sugar returned to 113 mg\/dL and his stools return to being formed and soft. His diabetic control and stools have remained under control on the combination of metformin and FORMULA A at the time of this writing and he has lost about 5.5 kg body weight. His hemoglobin A1c decreased to 6.3% and a microalbumin\/creatine ratio was 16.","Discussion","This case report is encouraging. Not only did FORMULA A appear to have a positive effect on fasting blood sugar, but the watery stools induced by treatment with metformin were normalized. This is a potentially important clinical observation. Metformin has been recommended as the initial drug of choice for the treatment of type-2 diabetes (26). Metformin has been reported to cause a 20% incidence of diarrhea in diabetic patients taking the drug compared to only 6% of diabetic patients not taking metformin (27). In fact, diarrhea with metformin is a sufficient problem that some diabetic patients cannot tolerate the drug. Since metformin has a good safety record, causes an approximate 2-3 kg weight loss and is a low-cost generic medication, increasing the tolerance to metformin while increasing its efficacy using a safe food supplement could have beneficial public health consequences.","Acarbose is another drug used to treat diabetes that is associated with the side effect of a watery stool because of its mechanisms of action.

Placebo is prepared by Merlin Development at the same time they prepare FORMULA A. Both formulations are coded by Merlin Development and the code is maintained with them as well as is held in confidence by a pharmacist at the study clinic until all data are collected at the end of study.","Subjects report weekly for measurements and assessment of any side effects. They are asked to collect a stool sample before initiating FORMULA A or Placebo intervention as well as at the end of the 4 week treatment period. During the screening, treatment, and follow-up periods, daily and weekly symptom data are collected using an interactive telephone-based system.","Pain and bowel function data are collected during the screening phase to ensure that patients had a suitable symptom level at study entry. Severity of pain and discomfort was assessed daily on a 5-point scale (0, none; 1, mild; 2, moderate; 3, intense; and 4, severe). Stool consistency data are monitored daily and scored as follows: 1, very hard; 2, hard; 3, formed; 4, loose; and 5, watery. Absence of stool was assigned a value of 0. Patients also record their IBS symptoms urgency (0%, feel no need to evacuate-100%, feel severe need to evacuate), stool frequency (# of stools per day), bloating (0, no sensation of extended abdomen; 1, mild; 2, moderate; 3, severe) and sense of incomplete evacuation (0, sensation of complete evacuation; 1, incomplete; 2, constipated) daily during the treatment and follow-up phases.","Subject Screening and Selection","Patients with IBS and a diarrhea-predominant bowel pattern aged 18 years or older are enrolled in this study if their symptoms fulfilled the Rome I criteria for IBS for at least 6 months. Patients undergo a 2-week screening evaluation to confirm sufficient level of pain and stool consistency before randomization. Since no objective criteria exist for subgrouping of IBS patients, physicians are asked to assess patients according to predominant pattern of bowel function based on the patient's disease history. Physicians are provided with a guideline based on the percentage of time the patient had experienced diarrhea. If diarrhea is present for \u226775% of the time, then the patient is classified as being diarrhea predominant.","Patients are excluded if they are pregnant, breastfeeding, or not using approved methods of contraception (if of child-bearing potential); if an unstable medical or other gastrointestinal condition exists; if there is a major psychiatric disorder or substance abuse within the previous 2 years; if an investigational drug was used within 30 days of the screening phase; or if a prohibited concurrent medication (likely to interfere with gastrointestinal tract function or analgesia) was used within 7 days before entering the screening phase.","Pain and bowel function data are collected during the screening phase to ensure that patients has a suitable symptom level at study entry as described above.","Appropriate Symptom and Laboratory Evaluation","Evaluations are performed at the screening of potential participants, at the beginning of the study, daily, and at the end of the 4 week treatment period.","1) Beginning of Study and Daily:\n\n","2) Beginning of Study:","Stool is collected and stored frozen but not analyzed until the end of study.","3) End of Study Assessment:","Analysis of the fecal microbiome DNA from both the initial sample and the final sample.","Study Design","Subjects selected for participation are allowed an ad libitum diet. Foods excluded include alcohol. The subjects are encouraged to consume either FORMULA A or Placebo within 1 hour prior to 2 meals each day with ingestion of the test agent being mandatory prior to the 3meal.","Subjects are given a 4 week supply of ether FORMULA A or Placebo at the onset and are instructed to consume the entire 180 ml volume containing either formula within 1 hour prior to either meals 1 and 2, as well as another 180 ml volume containing either formula within 1 hour prior to meal 3.","Subjects report weekly for measurements and assessment of IBS symptoms. During the screening and treatment periods, daily symptom data are collected using an interactive telephone-based system.","Outcome","This study is expected to demonstrate that FORMULA A and not Placebo:\n\n","Utilization of FORMULA A to treat idiopathic diarrhea such as a parasitic infection, a viral infection and a symptomatic response to a food is expected to also improve the severity of pain and discomfort, increase stool consistency, decrease the urgency to evacuate, decrease stool frequency, and decrease the sensation of bloating.","A 55 year old woman with chronic diarrhea that was associated with infection initially presents to her primary care physician diarrhea of 8 months duration that originally started shortly following treatment with cephalosporin and quinolone antibiotics for back surgery and a pulmonary infection. During these eight months, she is repeatedly treated with metronidazole and vancomycin, and required several hospitalizations for intravenous hydration. The patient complains of loose small bowel movements every 15 minutes, accompanied by great urgency and rectal tenesmus. She wears diapers at all times and loses 10% of her body weight. Flexible sigmoidoscopy demonstrates classic pseudomembranous colitis. Stool samples are positive for toxins A and B, and stool culture confirms heavy growth of this bacterium. The patient is again treated with vancomycin, but fails to respond. She is subsequently prescribed nitazoxanide (2-acetyloxy-N-(5-nitro-2-thiazolyl)benzamide), 500 mg orally, twice daily. Ten day after discontinuation of Nitazoxanide, the patient has recurrence of her original diarrheal symptoms. Endoscopic analysis indicates return of pseudomembranous colitis, and stool studies are again positive for . Despite two more cycles of Nitazoxanide, including one lasting a full month, and continuous administration of Florastor, a probiotic containing , the -induced colitis reoccurrs.","Since conventional treatment fails to resolve the , fecal bacteriotherapy is offered to break the cycle of recurrences and achieve a potential cure. Informed consent is obtained from both the patient and the donor following discussion with each of the potential risks, benefits, and alternative options. The patient is maintained on Nitazoxanide until the day before the procedure. The patient's husband of 44 years (donor) is prescribed FORMULA A 3 times a day for 2 weeks. Fecal donor material is taken from him, who has no risk factors for blood-borne communicable diseases, has no recent exposure to antibiotics, has no gastrointestinal symptoms of any kind, and tests negative for common stool pathogens and . Bacteriotherapy is delivered into the patient's right colon by way of a colonoscopy. The patient is expected to have her first solid bowel movement on the second day following treatment. It is expected that her abdominal pain gradually subsides, and at one month following bacteriotherapy and it is expected that her stool samples will be negative for . The patient is expected to commence FORMULA A twice a day. At six months follow-up, the patient is expected to report once-daily formed stools.","All measurements disclosed herein are at standard temperature and pressure, at sea level on Earth, unless indicated otherwise.
