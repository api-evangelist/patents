title: Application optimization in a network system
abstract: A network system includes multiple network resource information handling systems (IHSs) for managing applications and application communications. An IHS operating system initializes an application optimizer to provide application acceleration capability to application optimizers, such as application delivery controllers (ADCs) and wide area network (WAN) optimizer controllers (WOCs) within the network system. Upon receipt of a server application request message (SARM), a network system server responds with a restful application optimizer message (RAOM) that includes protocol, policy, and other application optimizer information that pertains to the requesting SARM. Application optimizers may include clients, ADCs and WOCs that reside within the message communication path between client and server. Application optimizers may store protocol, policy, and other information from RAOM to populate application table data. Application optimizers intercept messages between network resources of the network system and apply message policies to improve message performance thereby improving application performance within the network system.

{"@attributes":{"id":"description"},"BRFSUM":[{},{}],"heading":["BACKGROUND","BRIEF SUMMARY","DETAILED DESCRIPTION"],"p":["The disclosures herein relate generally to network systems, and more specifically, to application optimization in a network system.","Modern information handling systems (IHSs) typically employ operating systems that execute applications or other processes that may require the resources of multiple processors or processor cores. Network systems may include multiple IHSs that execute applications and manage application information. Users may access network system resources that use multiple IHSs to request application services from servers or application servers.","Network systems may include IHSs that provide application server services and other network services during application or program execution. Users, clients, or other entities may require the services of network resources such as application servers. Network systems may employ network resources, such as application delivery controllers (ADCs) and wide area network (WAN) optimizer controllers (WOCs). ADCs and WOCs may increase, accelerate, or otherwise optimize application execution performance. Application optimizations seek to improve user experience and user services during application operations.","ADCs, WOCs, and other network system resources may benefit from the efficient management of messages and corresponding network packet transfers during user, client, and server application operations. In particular, effective packet management may improve user quality of experience (QoE) and quality of service (QoS) performance characteristics during application execution in a network system. Effective application optimizer tools may significantly improve application execution efficiency in an IHS and corresponding network system.","In one embodiment, a method is disclosed that includes receiving from a first information handling system (IHS), by a second IHS, a request for application services transmitted over a communication path in a network. The method also includes populating, by the second IHS, an application table in a third IHS in the communication path, the application table storing application optimizer information received from the second IHS. In one embodiment, the populating of the application table is responsive to the request for application services. In another embodiment, the populating of the application table is not responsive to a request for application services. The method further includes generating, by the second IHS, an application response to the request for application services, the application response being directed to the first IHS. The method still further includes testing, by the third IHS, the application response to determine if the application table includes a table reference to the application response, the third IHS retrieving application optimizer information from the application table if the application table includes a table reference to the application response, the third IHS otherwise performing a deep packet inspection on the application response. The method also includes applying, by the third IHS, the application optimizer information to the application response.","In another embodiment, a network system is disclosed that includes a communication path to which a first information handling system (IHS) and a second IHS couple to enable communication between the first and second IHS, wherein the second IHS receives a request for application services from the first IHS via the communication path. The network system also includes a third IHS situated in the communication path between the first and second IHS, the third IHS including an application table that stores application optimizer information received from the second IHS in response to the request for application services. In this embodiment, the second IHS generates an application response to the request for application services, the application response being directed to the first IHS. In this embodiment, the third IHS tests the application response to determine if the application table includes a table reference to the application response. The third IHS retrieves application optimizer information from the application table if the application table includes a table reference to the application response. The third IHS otherwise performs a deep packet inspection on the application response. In this embodiment, the third IHS applies the application optimizer information to the application response.","In yet another embodiment, a computer program product is disclosed that includes a non-transitory computer readable storage medium. The computer program product also includes first instructions that receive from a first information handling system (IHS) by a second IHS a request for application services transmitted over a communication path in a network. The computer program product further includes second instructions that populate by the second IHS an application table in a third IHS in the communication path, the application table storing application optimizer information received from the second IHS, the populating of the application table being responsive to the request for application services. The computer program product still further includes third instructions generate by the second IHS an application response to the request for application services, the application response being directed to the first IHS. The computer program product also includes fourth instructions that test by the third IHS the application response to determine if the application table includes a table reference to the application response, the third IHS retrieving application optimizer information from the application table if the application table includes a table reference to the application response, the third IHS otherwise performing a deep packet inspection on the application response. The computer program product further includes fifth instructions that apply the application optimizer information to the application response. The first, second, third, fourth and fifth program instructions are stored on the non-transitory computer readable storage medium.","A network system may include multiple information handling systems (IHSs). These network system IHSs may employ operating system software that executes applications or processes. These IHSs may include application optimizer software and tools that manage network system resources during application execution and application information communication within the network system. In one embodiment, a user or other entity may employ the resources of a client IHS to access application server IHS services, such as those of a JAVA application server. (Java is a trademark of the Oracle Corp.) A user may send a message from a client to a server in the form of a service request message. The user may use this service request message to communicate from client to server via one or more network packets.","Network packets may take the form of multiple protocols or configurations within the network system. For example, network packets may be in the form of Ethernet packets, hypertext transfer protocol (HTTP) packets, point to point protocol over Ethernet (PPPoE) packets, Fiber Channel packets, or many other network packet protocols.","Application optimizers are special application message managers and corresponding packet management tools. An application optimizer supports and enhances application execution operations within network system IHSs. Application optimizers include application delivery controllers (ADCs) and wide area network (WAN) optimizer controllers (WOCs). ADCs and WOCs are transparent to the user and provide application message optimizations during message communications across the network. These application message optimizations may offload the services that servers typically provide. However, this offloading of server duties comes at the expense of server processing bandwidth. ADCs and WOCs process \u201cmessages\u201d in the form of network packets, or more simply \u201cpackets\u201d during network system communications.","ADCs may perform common server tasks and provide load balancing between multiple servers. ADCs may provide network content manipulation, advanced packet routing and highly configurable health monitoring. ADCs may provide extensive compression, caching, multiplexing, application layer security, content switching, and other capabilities. The security features of an ADC may include a secure sockets layer (SSL) capability as well as other security protocols and mechanisms.","(WAN) optimizer controllers (WOCs) may provide functions similar to those of ADCs. However, WOCs may come in pairs that provide symmetrical services for network message communications. For example, a WOC may compress packet data on the sending end of a packet transfer, while another WOC of the WOC pair decompresses packet data on the receiving end of a packet transfer. WOCs may manage traffic shaping or traffic shaping polices for messages and their corresponding packets within the network system. For example, WOCs may slow down some message transfers or even drop messages, such as peer-to-peer communications, and their corresponding packets as policies dictate. WOCs may also provide other functions and services, such as encryption and decryption within a network system.","Like ADCs, WOCs may employ a variety of mechanisms to offload server functions and provide application acceleration benefits for servers within the network system. WOCs may reduce or eliminate redundant message transfers, eliminate stale data within local caches that support servers, compress and prioritize data, and many other server support functions as well.","In a network system, ADCs and WOCs may employ a deep packet inspection (DPI) to gather sufficient information about a particular message to determine what application optimization protocols apply to the particular message. The DPI may be compute-intensive for the ADC or WOC. Thus, a DPI may slow down a message transfer form one network system resource to another.","Network system resources may examine header information, such as 5-tuple information, included in network messages. For example messages, and more particularly their corresponding packets, may include a header area, such as 5-tuple area that includes source address, destination address, source port, destination port, and protocol information. This header information provides network resources with enough information to process the packet for routing and other common network functions. However, ADCs and WOCs may require more extensive packet analysis to determine application specific information.","ADCs and WOCs may perform DPI operations or filtering to gain access to, or inspect, information within a message or corresponding packet that does not reside within the message packet header. The message packet header typically contains routing information for the message packet and is more readily accessible than the remaining message information. ADCs and WOCs perform DPI operations as the message passes through inspection points within the ADC or WOC. The ADC or WOC may search the message for protocol information to determine that predefined protocol criteria to allow to the message management.","In one embodiment, an application optimizer tool such as application optimizer software may employ an application table that stores and maintains DPI style information for messages that transfer within the network system. The application optimizer may provide ADC IHSs and WOC IHSs with an efficient method of message interrogation and inspection during message transfer.","In one embodiment, a user or other entity employs a client IHS or \u201cclient\u201d to send a server application request message (SARM), namely a request for application services, to an application server IHS, or \u201cserver\u201d. In this manner, the user may invoke a server application by employing a particular message. The server honors the particular message and before sending application specific message information back to the client, the server may first respond with a restful application optimizer message (RAOM) that includes application optimizer information, as described in more detail below. The server does not intend the RAOM specifically for the client, but rather for the ADCs and WOCs in the network system communication path between the server and the client. In one embodiment, if the client includes a WOC or similar resource, then the client will also receive and interpret the RAOM. The ADCs and WOCs of the network system employ an application optimizer tool that interrogates the RAOM to retrieve application optimizer information from the RAOM. The network system may implement the application optimizer tool in software or hardware depending on the particular application.","The RAOM provides ADCs and WOCs with application specific information that is useful to reduce or eliminate the need for DPI operations. The RAOM may provide application information for multiple applications, such as those within the servers, at a time. In one embodiment, ADCs and WOCs employ application optimizer software to populate application tables with application message information and corresponding packet attributes, as described in more detail below. ADCs and WOCs may use the information within the application tables to associate messages and their corresponding packets with application protocols, server protocols, and other information. In this particular embodiment, each message corresponds to a respective packet. In another embodiment, a message may include multiple packets.","When a network resource such as a server sends a message to a client, ADCs and WOCs in the message path may perform application optimizing operations on that message. In one embodiment, the particular ADC or WOC in the message path extracts header information, such as 5-tuple header information, from the message. Header information for a particular packet or message may include information such as source and destination information for the particular packet or message. For example, the header information of a packet or message may include the source IP address, destination IP address, source port, destination port and protocol type for that packet or message. The particular ADC or WOC employs the header information to locate or index specific application optimization information for that message within the application table that the particular ADC or WOC maintains. The ADC or WOC may match one or more pieces of information from the message's header to use as index data into the application table information.","If a match is not found within a particular application table of a particular ADC or WOC, that particular ADC or WOC may then perform a more time intensive DPI operation on the non-matching message. However, if a match is found within a particular application table of a particular ADC or WOC, that particular ADC or WOO may interrogate the application table entry for the matching message. The application table entry for the matching message contains information that the particular ADC or WOC may perform to provide application optimization operations on the matching message. In other words, the ADC or WOC fetches information from the application table to determine what to do with the matching message, rather than performing a deep packet inspection (DPI).","As time proceeds and more and more servers generate more and more RAOMs, the application tables within ADCs and WOCs of the network system populate with useful and current application information. The application table information may provide the ADC or WOC with information as to how to compress, encrypt, or provide other traffic shaping or policy services to messages within the network system. In one embodiment, servers of the network system may send explicit RAOMs to update application tables within particular ADCs and WOCs to keep these application tables current and up-to-date. In this scenario, the RAOM is regarded as being an unsolicited RAOM that the server targets at a particular ADC or WOC. ADCs and WOCs may maintain caches that reflect the most current information in their respective application tables. To improve network efficiencies, servers may employ RAOMs to maintain ADC and WOC application table caches with up-to-date information.","In one embodiment, the disclosed application optimizer method improves ADC and WOC message management in a network system by application optimization in the form of application acceleration. A user requiring the application services of a server benefits from an increase in network system efficiencies. These network efficiencies impact user quality of experience (QoE) and quality of service (QoS) performance. The disclosed application optimizer method manages applications that employ dynamic port allocations. Dynamic port allocations may provide application services with address port changes during application message transfers. The disclosed method also supports the use of multiple and simultaneous port addressing within the network system.",{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0031","num":"0030"},"figref":"FIG. 1","b":["100","180","300","300","100","105","105","100","100","110","105","125","115","120","125","105","125"]},"Processor  may also include local memory (not shown) such as L1 and L2 caches (not shown). A video graphics controller  couples a display  to bus . Nonvolatile storage , such as a hard disk drive, CD drive, DVD drive, or other nonvolatile storage couples to bus  to provide IHS  with permanent storage of information. I\/O devices , such as a keyboard and a mouse pointing device, couple to bus  via I\/O controller  and I\/O bus .","One or more expansion busses , such as USB, IEEE 1394 bus, ATA, SATA, PCI, PCIE, DVI, HDMI and other busses, couple to bus  to facilitate the connection of peripherals and devices to IHS . A network interface adapter  couples to bus  to enable IHS  to connect by wire or wirelessly to a network and other information handling systems. Network interface adapter  may also be called a network communication adapter or a network adapter. While  shows one IHS that employs processor , the IHS may take many forms. For example, IHS  may take the form of a desktop, server, portable, laptop, notebook, netbook, tablet or other form factor computer or data processing system. IHS  may take other form factors such as a gaming device, a personal digital assistant (PDA), a portable telephone device, a communication device or other devices that include a processor and memory.","IHS  employs an operating system (OS)  that may store information on nonvolatile storage . IHS  includes a computer program product on digital media  such as a CD, DVD or other media. In one embodiment, a designer or other entity configures the computer program product with application optimizer  software to practice the disclosed application optimizer methodology. In practice, IHS  may store application optimizer  and application table  on nonvolatile storage  as application optimizer \u2032 and application table , respectively. Nonvolatile storage  may also store OS . In one embodiment, not shown, OS  may include application optimizer .","When IHS  initializes, the IHS loads application optimizer \u2032, OS , and application table  into system memory  for execution as application optimizer \u2033, OS \u2032, and application table \u2032, respectively. During execution of application optimizer , IHS  may employ application table  to store message or network packet information, as described in more detail below. In accordance with the disclosed methodology, application optimizer  may employ application table  as well as other memory resources of IHS  to maintain network communication packet information during application execution and message communications. IHS  described above may be called a network system IHS in the sense that more than one of these network system IHSs may couple together to form a network, as described in more detail below.",{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0036","num":"0035"},"figref":"FIG. 2","b":["200","200","210","200","210","210","210","180","300","180","300","210","200"]},"Network system  includes a wide area network optimizer controller (WOC) . WOG  is another type of network system IHS. In one embodiment, WOO  may include application optimizer  and application table . Application optimizer  may employ application table  to store application message attributes to practice the disclosed application optimizer methodology in WOO . WOO  couples to client  and wide area network (WAN) . WAN  may include multiple network resources (not shown) and provide connections and communication links between other networks, such as local area networks (LANs) (not shown).","WAN  couples to a router  that couples to another WOC . WOC  is another network system IHS in network . In one embodiment, WOC  may include application optimizer  and application table . Application optimizer  may employ application table  to store application message attributes to practice the disclosed application optimizer methodology for WOC . WOCs provide bi-directional network packet functions that require pair action between client and server resources of network system . For example, one WOC may compress a message and a corresponding partner WOC may decompress the same message. In this manner, WOCs may provide message or network packet functions that are transparent to clients, servers, and users of the network system  resources.","Network system  includes an application delivery controller (ADC)  that couples to WOC  and multiple servers, namely a server , a server , and a server . Server  includes an application , server  includes an application , and server  includes an application . Each application, namely application ,  and , provides application services for their respective servers, namely corresponding servers ,  and . ADC  is another network system IHS in network . Servers ,  and  are also network system IHSs. In one embodiment, ADC  may include application optimizer  and application table . Application optimizer  may employ application table  to store application message attributes to practice the disclosed application optimizer methodology for ADC . ADCs and WOCs may interpret policy information that pertains or relates to a particular message and apply policy guidelines to that particular message. For example, an ADC or WOC may maintain a policy for text-based instant messaging applications that differs in priority from that of video stream application messaging. The ADC or WOC may offer messages that correspond to video streaming or video stream applications a higher priority of communication bandwidth within network system  than other messages, such as text-based instant messaging messages. The policy guidelines described above are an example of application optimizer information.","Client , WOC , WOC , and ADC  form a group of network system  IHSs that employ application optimizer  software and application table  information. Each of these network system IHSs, namely client , WOC , WOC  and ADC  is a network resource, i.e. a network resource IHS. This group of network resources, as shown enclosed by dashed lines, constitutes an application optimizer group (AOG) . In one embodiment, each network resource IHS within AOG  includes a respective application optimizer  and application table , as shown in . Each network resource within AOG  works independently or in cooperation with one another network resource to improve message handling efficiency and thereby improve application operation within network system . In one embodiment, each application table  within AOG  maintains identical application message attribute information. In another embodiment of the disclosed application optimizer method, each application table  may provide unique and specific information that pertains to the particular network system IHSs in which the application table resides. In that embodiment, the application tables  within the network resource IHSs of AOG  may each store different information.","A user or other entity may execute applications, such as application , , and  within one of multiple network system  servers, such as those of server , server , server , and other servers (not shown). The user may employ the resources of client  to generate application requests to servers or other resources of network system  in the form of messages or packets.

SARM  may include one or more packets that communicate a user's application request to server . Network system  resources monitor SARM  and route the corresponding packet or packets from client  to server . Typically the resources of network system  employ the header information, such as the 5-tuple information in each packet of SARM , to determine the destination port or destination ID and properly align that destination with server , as in this example.","In one embodiment, the information in  shows only one table entry of application table  that corresponds to a particular message.

RAOM  may include sufficient information to populate one or more entries of application table  and avoid the need for deep packet inspection (DPI) operations. IHSs of AOG  may employ header information within messages, such as application message , to determine indexing into application table . In another embodiment, server  may issue an explicit RAOM  that is not in response to SARM . In other words, server  or other server of network system  may issue a periodic and\/or explicit RAOM  or other restful application optimizer messages. Stated alternatively, server  or other server of network system  may issue an RAOM  on its own initiative and send the explicit RAOM  to a particular ADC or WOC.

For example, application message  may include header information corresponding to port  that application optimizer  identifies as a video streaming application.","If an IHS of AOG  finds a match or corresponding entry within its respective application table , then application optimizer  of the AOG  IHS performs an application table  lookup, as per block . For example, ADC  may inspect application message  and determine that the destination port information of application message  corresponds to a table entry in respective application table . In that case, application optimizer  directs ADC  resources to perform an application table  lookup operation and to read or recover the application table  application message attributes as shown in .","However, if an IHS of AOG  that intercepts application message  determines that there is no match or corresponding entry within its respective application table , then the intercepting ADC, WOC or other IHS of AOG  may perform a deep packet inspection (DPI). The intercepting IHS or AOG  IHS performs deep packet inspection DPI on application message , as per block . For example, ADC  may perform DPI operations on application message  and its constituent network packet. DPI often requires time intensive analysis of messages, such as application message , and may restrict or otherwise impede some application optimization efforts.","Since AOG  IHS attribute table  lookups do not require network packet examination, they are more efficient and consume less time than DPI operations. This reduction in DPI operations improves application efficiencies, particularly with respect to communication bandwidth utilization in network system . In this manner, users and other entities may see improvements in server application execution speeds. Application execution speed improvements or accelerations translate to improvements in QoE and QoS performance measures.","AOG  IHS attribute table  lookups do not require multiple read operations. For example, ADC  may determine application message  attributes in a single lookup operation or single state. In this manner, ADC  and other IHSs of AOG  may be stateless, and thus do not require multiple states or processing cycles to determine message attributes during network system  communications.","In one embodiment, AOG  resources such as ADCs and WOCs, read destination port information from the header information of messages, such as application message . In other embodiments, application optimizer  may direct ADC and WOC resources to organize and index application table  by information other than destination port information, such as destination IP or any other information that application message  and corresponding network packets provide.","Each IHS of AOG  that intercepts and interrogates application message  applies policies to application message  and its constituent network packet, as per block . In other words, each AOG  IHS completes a DPI or retrieves application table  application attributes that correspond to application message . Application optimizer  instructs the intercepting AOG  IHS to apply the policies and protocols that correspond to the information as shown in application table . For example, depending upon compressibility protocol, ADC  may compress the information of application message  before allowing application message  to continue along the communication paths of network system . In another example, ADC  may perform encryption or decryption upon the contents of application message  depending upon the application message attributes within application table  of ADC . Many other policy and protocol objectives are possible within the disclosed application optimizer method.","ADCs and WOCs continue applying network packet policies on each application message that passes through AOG , such as client , ADC , WOC  and WOC . The disclosed application optimizer method ends, as per block . In this manner, application optimizer  provides protocol and policy information on a per application message basis for application messages, such as network packet transfers within network system . For each application message and corresponding network packet that passes through network system  resource that employs the disclosed methodology, efficient protocol packet management is possible. Ultimately, improved network packet protocol management translates to improvements in server application execution by improving performance of AOG , and particularly ADC and WOC operations within network system . The user benefits from improvements in application execution rates, such as those of applications ,  and  and both QoE and QoS performance measures.","In one embodiment, client  or other network resource IHSs may include ADC, WOC, or similar functional capability in either a physical or virtualized form within the network resource IHS itself. In that case, those IHSs that include ADC, WOC, or similar capability may employ the same application optimization features per the disclosed application optimizer methodology.","As will be appreciated by one skilled in the art, aspects of the disclosed application optimizer methodology may be embodied as a system, method or computer program product.
