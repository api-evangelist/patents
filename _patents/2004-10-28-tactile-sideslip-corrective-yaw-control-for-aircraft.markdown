title: Tactile side-slip corrective yaw control for aircraft
abstract: Side-slip of an aircraft during flight is detected through a pair of pressure sensors fixedly mounted on opposite lateral sides of the aircraft fuselage. Pressure measurement signals at said sensors are fed to electronic circuitry within the aircraft for generating magnitude and frequency signals reflective of the side-slip that are applied to a pair of vibrators respectively mounted on the undersides of a pair of pilot foot pedals located within the cockpit. The foot pedals are connected by linkage to the tail rudder on the aircraft fuselage. The varying magnitude and frequency of vibrations applied to the rudder foot pedals by the vibrators enables the pilot to immediately sense side-slip through the feet on the pedals. In response to such side-slip sensing, one of the pedals may be timely depressed for side-slip corrective angular displacement of the rudder.

{"@attributes":{"id":"description"},"GOVINT":[{},{}],"heading":["STATEMENT OF GOVERNMENT INTEREST","BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION","SUMMARY OF THE INVENTION","DETAILED DESCRIPTION OF THE PREFERRED EMBODIMENT"],"p":["The invention described herein may be manufactured and used by or for the Government of the United States of America for governmental purposes without the payment of any royalties thereon or therefore.","The present invention relates to aircraft control for side-slip corrective purposes.","Traditionally, aircraft are maneuvered by pitch and yaw control inputs applied in a coordinated manner for smooth directional maneuvering of the aircraft. During such maneuvering of the aircraft, the desired pilot coordinated control over a rudder maintains alignment between the fuselage longitudinal yaw axis and the oncoming flow of air during flight of the aircraft under a zero side-slip condition so as to (a) minimize drag, (b) reduce risk of inadvertent spin under low speed flight, and (c) provide for aircraft passenger comfort. In certain rotary-wing types of aircraft small residual side-slip is desired to counteract lateral load due to the tail rotor by pilot application of a sufficient degree of foot pedal depression. Various automatic maneuvering control systems have however been proposed for establishing the aforesaid desirable coordinated maneuvering control, because of the pilot's inability to continuously provide it manually. Various disadvantages have however been inherently associated with such automatic control systems. It is therefore an important object of the present invention to augment direct pilot maneuvering control by providing immediate tactile perception to the pilot so as to enable corrective response to aircraft side-slip due to non-alignment between the airflow flight path and the yaw axis and thereby avoid any substantial deviation from zero side-slip condition.","Pursuant to the present invention, an aircraft is provided with means for measuring the aircraft side-slip angle. Such side-slip measurements are utilized to generate signals with magnitude and frequency corresponding to side-slip, applied to tactile vibrators mounted on the underside of a pair of pilot foot controls providing the pilot with sense touch perception of any side-slipping condition, thereby enabling immediate pilot depression of the foot controls for corrective control over the aircraft relative to the yaw axis so as to minimize the perceived side-slip. The pilot may thereby provide such corrective control without visual reference to cockpit instruments.","Referring now to the drawing in detail,  illustrates a typical aircraft  during flight having a longitudinal yaw axis . The aircraft , which may be of a glider type, has a fuselage  with wings  attached thereto as well as horizontal and vertical stabilizers  and  at the tail end thereof. Pivotally connected to the horizontal stabilizers  are elevators , while a rudder  is pivotally connected the vertical stabilizer .","Maneuvering of the aircraft  as generally known in the art involves displacement of the elevators , the rudder  and ailerons under control of the pilot in the aircraft fuselage cockpit .","As shown in , pilot control is exercised by a pilot when seated on a seat  within the cockpit  to thereby manually manipulate control yoke  and depress a pair of rudder foot control pedals  operatively connected by linkages  to the rudder . Pursuant to the present invention, electromechanical vibrators  are mounted on the underside of the petals  so as to provide tactile or sense of touch signals applied to the pilot feet  positioned on the pedals  as depicted in , for yaw axis maneuvering control through the rudder  on the tail end of the aircraft fuselage . Generation of the pilot foot signals by the vibrators  applied to the pilot feet  is under control of a system  as diagrammed in , which includes a pair of static pressure detectors  mounted on opposite port and starboard sides of the fuselage .","With continued reference to , the rudder pedal vibrators  are connected by electric power cables  of the system  to a controller  which is connected to a side-slip yaw sensor  for reception of side-slip air pressure sensing signals received from the side-slip detectors . The side-slip detection signals from the detectors  is directly fed to a differential transducer . The output from the transducer  and a transducer  is fed to a calibrating control  from which supply of calibrated side-slip detection signals are fed to the side-slip sensor .","Based on the foregoing description, the controller  uses the side-slip signal from the sensor  to operate a selected one of the two vibrators  so as to signify to the pilot by vibration applied to one of the pilot feet  which of the rudder pedals  is to be depressed so as to effect angular displacement of the rudder  in one direction for side-slip error corrective purposes. The controller  may embody a dead band operational feature to by-pass selected pedal vibrator operation when the side-slip error is too small for correction. Furthermore, the controller  may incorporate a pilot actuated resetting switch and associated resetting circuit for varying the vibrating pressure applied to the rudder pedals  by the vibrators  so as accommodate different pilot sensibility preferences. The controller  may accordingly be selectively set to generate signals applied to the vibrators  by measurements of side-slip to be corrected by precise pilot yaw control through the rudder pedals . The signal correction proportionality measurement parameters of the controller  may be tuned to side-angle deviation, vibration frequency and vibration magnitude of the vibrators . Control over the rudder pedal vibrators  through the controller  may also be utilized for signifying the requirement of corrective pedal foot input to avoid forthcoming dangerous flight conditions alerted to the pilot.","It will be apparent from the foregoing description that in addition to controlled maneuvering of the aircraft  during flight through the steering wheel , the pedals , the horizontal stabilizer elevators  and the rudder , as generally known in the art, side-slip corrective adjustment control may be applied to the rudder  by the pilot through the pedals  in response to tactile sensing of vibrations applied thereto by the vibrators . Such vibrations vary in magnitude and frequency in accordance with the detection of aircraft side-slip through the side-slip detector ports  and a side-slip indicating vane .",{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0017","num":"0016"},"figref":"FIG. 4","b":["58","60","58","62","58","58"]},"Obviously, other modifications and variations of the present invention may be possible in light of the foregoing teachings.
