{"@attributes":{"id":"description"},"RELAPP":[{},{}],"p":["This application is a Continuation of U.S. patent application Ser. No. 12\/937,143, filed 19 May 2011, which is the National Phase filing of PCT Application No. IB2009\/005217, filed 10 Apr. 2009, which claims priority of European Application No. EP 08290360.0, filed 11 Apr. 2008, the entireties of which applications are incorporated herein by reference.","The present invention relates to a plastic film which can be used as a dielectric film in capacitors. The invention also relates to the process of manufacturing such plastic film.","A capacitor generally consists of two conducting metal plates separated by an insulating media (dielectric film) capable of storing electrical energy. The capacitor is formed by sandwiching the dielectric film between the two conducting metal plates. The film serves as an insulant which prevents the electrons from moving from one capacitor plate to the opposite plate. The maximum energy that can be safely stored in a particular capacitor is limited by the maximum electric field that the dielectric can withstand before it breaks.","The energy which can be stored by the film is proportional to the dielectric constant of the film and to the electrical breakdown of the dielectric as shown by the following equation.\n\nEnergy density 0.5\u00b7\u2208\u00b7\u2208\u00b7BDV,\n\n","The energy density of a capacitor containing a plastic film can be increased by increase of the relative permittivity. This is obtained by use of a polar polymeric material or by addition of a polar component such as polar polymers or additives such as ceramic particles in the polymeric film.","Capacitors in which a plastic film is used as the dielectric film with high relative permittivity are known in the art. For example, EP-A-0 039 214 describes capacitors in which the dielectric film comprises a vinylidene fluoride polymer, polycarbonate and\/or a thermoplastic polyester.","U.S. Pat. No. 6,426,861 describes a plastic film having a high energy density. This film is made of a homogeneous mixture comprising at least one non-polar homopolymer and at least one polar or non-polar homopolymer. Examples of non-polar homopolymers are: polypropylene (PP), polyethylene naphthalate (PEN), polycarbonate (PC) and polyphenylene sulphide (PPS). An example of a polar polymer is polyvinylidene fluoride (PVDF). The homopolymers are blended and co-extruded with homogenization to form a melt-cast hybrid copolymer dielectric film. This document describes polymeric hybrid copolymers of PVDF and PP. It also describes a copolymer comprising PVDF and PP as one component and either PPS or PC or PET or PEN as a second component. The film disclosed in U.S. Pat. No. 6,426,861 is prepared from homogeneous solid-solution mixtures.","The energy density of a capacitor containing a plastic film can be increased by increase of the breakdown voltage of the plastic film.","EP-A-1 712 592 discloses a biaxially oriented film suitable as a film capacitor. This biaxially oriented film comprises a aromatic polyester (a) and a polyolefin (b) having a melting point of from 230 to 280\u00b0 C., wherein the ratio of the polyolefin (b) is from 2 to 60% based on the entire weight of the film. The polyolefin is preferably a styrene polymer having a syndiotactic structure. It is preferred that the film does not have voids. The voids formed at the boundary between the aromatic polyester (a) forming the matrix phase and the polyolefin (b) forming the island phase. In case where voids are present, the film tends to be cut in the film stretching step. Further, as the film thickness is reduced, the portions of the voids result in defects which deteriorate the mechanical characteristic or deteriorate the withstand voltage characteristic. The voids can be eliminated by using a compatibilizing agent.","The present invention is directed to a plastic film having a high breakdown voltage. This film can be used as a dielectric film in a capacitor. It imparts a high energy density to the capacitor.","The present invention is also directed to a process for increasing the breakdown voltage of a plastic film by modification of the plastic film morphology.","The invention is directed to a stretched film comprising a dispersion of at least one polyester and\/or polycarbonate in a matrix of at least one polyester and\/or polycarbonate different from the first polyester and\/or polycarbonate, the percentage by weight of the dispersed polyester and\/or polycarbonate in the dispersion being less than 50% and the dispersed polyester and\/or polycarbonate being in the form of platelets.","In one embodiment, the stretched film has a thickness in the range of 0.3 to 25 \u03bcm, preferably in the range of 0.9 to 6 \u03bcm, more preferably in the range of 2 to 4 \u03bcm.","In one embodiment, the largest dimension of said platelets is less than 10 microns, preferably less than 5 microns, more preferably less than 1 micron.","The invention is also directed to a stretched film comprising a mixture comprising:","at least 50% by weight of a matrix of at least one polyester and\/or polycarbonate,","at least one polyester and\/or polycarbonate miscible and compatible with the at least one polyester and\/or polycarbonate constituting the matrix and forming a separate phase in the matrix, the mixture being devoid of compatibilizer.","In one embodiment, in the said matrix of at least one polyester and\/or polycarbonate, the polyester is selected from the group comprising polyethylene terephthalate (PET), polyethylene naphthalate (PEN), polyethylene isophthalate, polybutylene terephthalate (PBT), polybutylene isophthalate, polybutylene naphthalate, polytrimethylene terephthalate (PTT), polytrimethylene isophthalate, polytrimethylene naphthalate, poly(cyclohexylene-dimethanol-terephthalate (PCT), polymethylene 1,3-propylene terephthalate, polyhexamethylene terephthalate, polyisosorbide terephthalate (PEIT), polyhexamethylene naphthalate, polyarylates (Par), copolymers thereof, mixtures thereof and liquid crystalline polyesters.","In one embodiment, in the said matrix of at least one polyester and\/or polycarbonate, the polycarbonate is selected from the group comprising polypropylene carbonate (PPC), polyphthalate carbonate, diphenyl polycarbonate (DPC), polyethylene terephthalate carbonate, polyethylene carbonate, copolymers thereof and mixtures thereof.","In one embodiment, the at least one dispersed polyester or the at least one miscible and compatible polyester is selected from the group comprising, polyethylene terephthalate (PET), polyethylene naphthalate (PEN), polyethylene isophthalate, polybutylene terephthalate (PBT), polybutylene isophthalate, polybutylene naphthalate, polytrimethylene terephthalate (PTT), polytrimethylene isophthalate, polytrimethylene naphthalate, poly(cyclohexylene-dimethanol-terephthalate (PCT), polymethylene 1,3-propylene terephthalate, polyhexamethylene terephthalate, polyisosorbide terephthalate (PEIT), polyhexamethylene naphthalate, polyarylates (Par), copolymers thereof, mixtures thereof, and liquid crystalline polyesters.","In one embodiment, the at least one dispersed polycarbonate or the at least one miscible and compatible polycarbonate is selected from the group comprising polypropylene carbonate (PPC), polyphthalate carbonate, diphenyl polycarbonate (DPC), polyethylene terephthalate carbonate, polyethylene carbonate, copolymers thereof and mixtures thereof.","In one embodiment, the at least one dispersed polyester and\/or polycarbonate or the at least one miscible and compatible polyester and\/or polycarbonate is selected from polymers having a relative permittivity in the range from 1 to less than 6, preferably from 1 to 4, preferably from 2 to 4, more preferably from 2.5 to 3.5.","In one embodiment, the stretched film is bi-axially stretched.","In one embodiment, the stretched film has an electrical breakdown, measured by the mean of 5\u00d75 cm area, greater than 370 V\/\u03bcm, preferably in the range of 440 to 550 V\/\u03bcm.","In one embodiment, the stretched film has an energy density higher than 2.0 J\/cm, preferably in the range of 2.5 to 3.5 J\/cmand more preferably in the range of 3.5 to 4.5 J\/cm.","In one embodiment, the stretched film contains up to 60000 parts per million of filler particles.","In one embodiment, the stretched film is devoid of any filler.","In one embodiment, the stretched film has a mechanical modulus in machine direction (MD) or transverse direction (TD) higher than 1000 N\/mm, preferably in the range of 2500 to 4000 N\/mm.","In one embodiment, the stretched film has a shrinkage in both machine direction (MD) and transverse direction (TD) of less than 5% at a temperature of 150\u00b0 C. and less than 15% at a temperature of 200\u00b0 C.","In one embodiment, the dispersion consists of at least two polymers selected from the group consisting of polyesters and polycarbonates;

A very good miscibility is in particular obtained when the dispersed phase comprises a mixture of a polycarbonate and a polyester; and the polyester in the matrix is polyethylene terephthalate (PET) or a polybutylene terephthalate (PBT).

In the most preferred embodiment of the invention, the polymer mixture is a dispersion of at least one first polyester and\/or polycarbonate in a matrix of at least one second polyester and\/or polycarbonate different from the first polyester and\/or polycarbonate.","It is important that the at least one polymer of the dispersed phase copolymerizes with the at least one different polymer of the matrix phase only at the interface between the matrix phase and the dispersed phase. The process conditions must be selected such as to achieve a blend of compatible polymers. In the preferred embodiment, wherein the polymer mixture comprises at least one polyester and\/or polycarbonate dispersed in a matrix of at least one different polyester and\/or polycarbonate, it is emphasized that the film is not obtained through process conditions which lead to copolymerization of the polyesters or polycarbonates. Therefore, the process conditions such as temperature and mixing time are to be selected such as to minimize the degree of copolymerization either between polyesters, or between polycarbonates or between a polyester and a carbonate. It is possible to achieve the following structures:\n\n","Compatibility between two polyesters is obtained by miscibility and ester-ester exchange at the interface between the polyesters.","Compatibility between two polycarbonates is obtained by miscibility and carbonate-carbonate exchange at the interface between the polycarbonates.","Compatibility between a polyester and a polycarbonate is obtained by miscibility and ester-carbonate exchange at the interface between the polyester and a polycarbonate.","Compatibility between the dispersed phase and the matrix phase allows biaxial stretching especially at high loads of platelets.","The occurrence of a copolymerization reaction may be detected through Differential Scanning calorimetry (DSC) measurements.","The mixture initially contains at least two distinct polymers, which are each characterized by a glass transition temperature. The presence of the at least two distinct polymers in the mixture can be confirmed through DSC measurements. Indeed, the DSC technique detects as many distinct glass transition temperatures as the number of distinct polymers present in the mixture.","During the mixing and heating step the amount of each polymer in the mixture tends to decrease because of the occurrence of a copolymerization reaction between the polymers. If a copolymerization reaction occurs between the polymers then the distinct glass transition temperatures disappear and a unique glass transition occurs describing the formation of the copolymer. So assuming that copolymerization is completed, then the mixture contains only one copolymer and the DSC measurements indicate only one glass transition temperature peak corresponding to the copolymer formed.","In order to avoid copolymerization between the polyesters it is desirable to set a short mixing time. The mixing time is typically from about 5 minutes to about 40 minutes.","As an example of suitable temperature conditions, the mixture may be heated at a temperature T that is at least 5\u00b0 C. greater than the highest melting point of each polymer composing the mixture for a time such that the mixture still exhibits separate transition temperatures.","The temperature and the mixing time are preferably selected such that the mixture still exhibits separate glass transition temperatures. In the preferred embodiment, wherein the at least two distinct polymers are chosen from the group comprising polyesters and polycarbonates, these process conditions lead to a blend of polyesters and\/or polycarbonates and not to a copolyester.","Melt viscosities of polymers composing the blends are preferably in a range of 50 Pa\u00b7sec to 5000 Pa\u00b7sec at a temperature Tm which is the highest melting temperature of the polymers in the mixture.","The polymer mixture is then extruded through an extruder and a melt system. A primary film is formed through a slit die and cooled down on a quenching drum.","The primary film is then processed into a film. The stretching step causes the dispersed phase to change shape. The shape of the polyester nodules or islands changes from an initially substantially round shape to an elliptic shape also called platelet-like shape. The term platelet denotes a body having a substantially elliptic shape and which is characterized by a specific dimension ratio. This dimension ratio is the ratio of the platelets largest dimension to the platelets smallest dimension. It is at least 2, preferably at least 3, and most preferably at least 10. The smallest and largest dimensions are determined through electron microscopy by first cutting the film through its section, not through its plane, and then analyzing the picture of the resulting section.

The presence of the platelets also imparts a slower motion to the electrons. Platelets thus act as brakes slowing down the electrons motion and so reduce their kinetic energy. The electrons are forced to move around the platelets by repulsion forces created by the charges located at the interface of the dispersed platelets. The travel length of the electrons increases when the percentage of platelets increases as indicated in . Further, the higher the ratio of the platelets largest dimensions to the platelets smallest dimension the higher the breakdown voltage. The present invention is based on the discovery that the breakdown voltage of a plastic film can be increased by slowing down the electron motion across the film through the presence of platelets in the film. The presence of platelets creates a tortuosity which increases the travel length of the electrons. Tortuosity can be defined as the ratio of the travel length of the electrons to the width of the plastic film.","In a preferred embodiment the morphology leading to a higher break-down voltage can be achieved with a mixture of compatible polymers such as polyesters and\/or polycarbonates. The skilled person in the art can produce a similar morphology with a mixture of incompatible polymers by addition of compatibilizers.","The shape of the platelets can be varied according to the glass transition temperature of the polymer constituting the dispersed phase.","The film is preferably bi-axially stretched. The primary film called cast film may be bi-axially stretched in both directions transverse direction (TD) and machine direction (MD) by the mean of a sequential or simultaneous process.","According to a preferred embodiment, the stretching ratio in each direction is in the range of 2 to 5 times, preferably from 3 to 4.5 times.","When a simultaneous process is carried out, the film is stretched at a temperature in the range of Tg+5\u00b0 C. to Tg+30\u00b0 C. where Tg corresponds to the highest glass transition temperature of the polymers constituting the mixture. The obtained thickness is typically in the range of 0.5-20 \u03bcm, preferably from 1.4 to 5 \u03bcm. The stretching temperature can be adapted in the case of a sequential stretch by the person skilled in the art.","The film then undergoes a heat treatment, which imparts dimensional stability to the film. The film is heated at a high temperature in the range of Tm\u221280\u00b0 C. to Tm\u221210\u00b0 C., preferably in the range of Tm\u221270\u00b0 C. to Tm\u221220\u00b0 C., where Tm is the highest melting temperature of the polymers in the mixture.","The film of the invention has a high service temperature. It can be used between 100\u00b0 C. and 130\u00b0 C. It thus finds use in high temperature and high-energy storage applications like capacitor films in hybrid cars.","The film of the invention can advantageously be used as a barrier to oxygen.","The film of the invention can advantageously be used as an electrical insulator film.","The following examples are illustrative of the invention and should not be considered as limiting.","The following examples are illustrative of the invention and should not be considered as limitative.","The properties measured on the film samples indicated shown in table I are the following:\n\n","A polyethylene naphthalate PEN polymer of an intrinsic viscosity of 0.63 dl\/g measured in 50% dichloroethane (DCE)\/trifluoroacetic acid solution is extruded in a twin-screw extruder.
