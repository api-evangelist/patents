title: Method and apparatus for dynamically establishing and joining an encrypted collaborative communication session
abstract: A system for establishing an encrypted multicast communication session over a communications network can include a client means (e.g., a radio, laptop, workstation, phone, PDA) and a server means. The client means can transmit a request for a first user to join a pre-defined collaborative group, including at least the first user and a second user. The client means can transmit a request for a first user to create or select a collaborative group based on specified criteria. The system can also include a server means that can retrieve, select or generate an encryption key for the collaborative group and transmit the encryption key to the first user via the client means. The server can transmit the encryption key to the second user via a second client means. The client means can communicate via multicast, encrypting end-to-end above the network layer using the encryption key received from the server means.

{"@attributes":{"id":"description"},"GOVINT":[{},{}],"heading":["STATEMENT OF GOVERNMENT INTEREST","FIELD OF THE INVENTION","BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION","SUMMARY OF THE INVENTION","DETAILED DESCRIPTION OF THE INVENTION"],"p":["This invention was made with government support under contract number W15P7T-09-C-F600. The government may have certain rights in the invention.","The invention generally relates to methods and devices for establishing a secure communication session over a communications network. Specifically, the invention relates to establishment of secure multicast communication sessions.","One application of communications and networking technologies is to provide for communications among collaborative users. For example, multiple users may participate in a voice conference, some as contributors and others as listeners. Voice over Internet Protocol (VoIP) technology can be used to economically transmit the voice content over the Internet and over private networks that employ Internet technologies. Traditionally, as is the practice on the telephony circuit switched communications model, when multiple parties are participating in a voice conference over the Internet, a conference bridge is used to relay the communications among the parties. Capabilities such as Internet Protocol (IP) multicasting, available on the Internet and private IP-based networks, may not be utilized. This is particularly the case when communications need to be secured, as the Internet multicasting architecture did not incorporate security in the design, and current standards remain incomplete with respect to security over multicast communications.","For transmissions over fixed (non-mobile) networks, use of a conference bridge and secure unicast VoIP communications with that bridge may be an acceptable approach due to the availability of high-speed and high-bandwidth communication channels and the relative reliability of the network infrastructure. However, wireless networks, in particular mobile ad hoc networks, must be as efficient as possible in the usage of the network capacity, and cannot employ approaches that rely on a single component such as a conference bridge, or the communication paths to and from that bridge, being available. Instead, a conferencing architecture such as multicasting is used, since it leverages the broadcast nature of wireless communications and does not rely on a central conference bridge with multiple transmissions of the same information between the bridge and the participants. However, due to the aforementioned limitations with respect to multicast security, the current approach is typically to pre-configure the multicast group and its participants, pre-placing cryptographic keys and other communications parameters at all the end instruments for the users in the conference. If keys and communications parameters are not pre-placed, there is no capability for a user to dynamically join a group, i.e., for a user's end instrument to dynamic acquire the cryptographic key and other communication parameters necessary to participate in the group.","Enhancements are needed for support of dynamically establishing secure\/encrypted collaborative sessions across the Internet or IP-based private networks. The use of dynamically established secure collaborative sessions can remove restrictions associated with the current approach of preplanning multicast groups (e.g., users and end instruments of the multicast groups are predetermined) and user-to-end instrument association. Authorized users can move among different end instruments (a.k.a., clients) (e.g., use different tactical radios, laptops, work stations, phones, Personal Digital Assistants (PDAs), etc.). An authorized user can be defined as a user whose credentials have been authenticated and is authorized to join a collaborative group. Authorized users can securely transmit to other users in a collaborative group upon demand or securely access multicast content from other users in a collaborative group upon demand. Encryption can be performed above the network layer (e.g., at the application layer) of the communications network so that encryption is end-to-end (i.e., from the sending user's application within the sending client to the receiving user's application within a receiving client), even when the communications traverses different network technologies or goes through firewalls. The invention can be utilized, for example, in fixed or mobile ad hoc networks and can enable, for example, secure dynamic multicast sessions across the U.S. government Global Information Grid (GIG) to the tactical edge. Network usage for group communications can be reduced, as conference bridges do not have to be used.","In one aspect, a method for establishing an encrypted multicast communication session over a communications network can include receiving a request from at least a first user (e.g., an initiator) to join a pre-defined collaborative group. The collaborative group can include at least the first user and a second user. The method can include retrieving or generating an encryption key for the pre-defined collaborative group and transmitting (e.g., via a first server) the encryption key for the pre-defined collaborative group to at least a first client of the first user.","The method can also include receiving an identifier for the pre-defined collaborative group from the first user to request joining the pre-defined collaborative group. A uniform resource identifier (URI), a telephone number, or other method of identifying the collaborative group can be received from the first user to request joining the pre-defined collaborative group.","The method can include receiving credentials for at least the first user (e.g., a user name and a password for the first user). The credentials for the first user can be verified\/checked against stored credentials to authenticate the first user.","Access permissions for at least the first user can be determined. The access permissions can include whether or not the user is authorized to access the session and, if so, whether the user is authorized to be a contributor or listener. An access permission of \u201cno access\u201d for example, would indicate that the user is not authorized to access the session.","The server can transmit over an appropriately secured channel a multicast address, a transport layer port number, an encryption algorithm selection, a message authentication code algorithm selection, a message authentication code key, an initialization vector or an access mode to a first client of the first user. In some embodiments, a second server transmits the encryption key for the pre-defined collaborative group to a second client of the second user, where the first user and the first server belong to a first domain and the second user and second server belong to a second domain.","In some embodiments, a third server can transmit the encryption key for the pre-defined collaborative group to the first client of the first user via the first server. The third server can also transmit at least one of a multicast address, a transport layer port number, an encryption algorithm selection, a message authentication code algorithm selection, a message authentication code key, an initialization vector or an access mode to the first client of the first user via the first server. The third server can also transmit a termination message to the first client of the first user via the first server where the security of the collaborative group is threatened. The first user and the first server can belong to the first domain and the collaborative group and the third server can belong to a third domain.","The pre-defined collaborative group can include a third user. In some embodiments, the security of the collaborative group can be threatened, for example, due to a compromise of the third user or third user's client. A termination message can be transmitted to the first client of the first user, a second client of the second user and a third client of the third user to terminate the multicast communication session. A second encryption key can be transmitted to the remaining users (e.g., the first client of the first user and the second client of the second user). The first client or the second client can discontinue use of the encryption key after a predetermined time after transmitting the second encryption key. Where the first user and the second user are in different domains, the first server in the first domain can transmit the termination message and the second encryption key to the first client user in the first domain. A second server in the second domain can transmit the termination message and the second encryption key to the second client of the second user belonging to the second domain.","A message can be transmitted to at least the first client of the first user (or the other users in the collaborative group). The message can include for the multicast session, e.g., data corresponding to a multicast address, a transport layer port number, an encryption algorithm selection, a message authentication code algorithm selection, a message authentication code key, an initialization vector or an access mode.","In another aspect, a method for establishing an encrypted multicast communication session over a communications network can include receiving a request from a first user to create or select a collaborative group based on specified criteria. The method can also include selecting or generating an encryption key for the collaborative group and transmitting (e.g., via a server) the encryption key for the collaborative group to at least a first client of the first user.","The collaborative group can be created based on the specified criteria. The collaborative group can also be selected (e.g., from a database of stored collaborative groups) based on the specified criteria. A request from a first user can specify criteria, for example, a geographical location, an organization, a rank, or a set of users. The collaborative group can be either created or selected (e.g., searched and selected from a stored database) based on the specified geographical location, the specified organization, the specified rank, or the specified set of users.","In some embodiments, users can send (e.g., during registration with the server using a client), and a server can receive and store, information relating to a geographical location for at least a first user.","A message can be transmitted to at least the first client of the first user (e.g., or other users of the collaborative group). The message can include data corresponding to the encryption key, a multicast address, a transport layer port number, an encryption algorithm selection, a message authentication code algorithm selection, a message authentication code key, an initialization vector or an access mode.","A multicast session can be encrypted using an encryption key that is selected and assigned by the server from two or more stored encryption keys. A multicast session can also be encrypted by the server generating the encryption key using a random number generator.","In one aspect, a method for establishing an encrypted multicast communication session over a communications network can include transmitting, via a client, a request for a first user to join a pre-defined collaborative group including at least the first user and a second user. An encryption key for the pre-defined collaborative group can be received at a client.","Collaborative content can be transmitted between a first application on a first client and a second application on a second client (e.g., via IP multicast). The collaborative content can include, for example, voice, video, or other data. The content can be encrypted end-application to end-application above the network layer (e.g., of the communications network) of the communications network using the received encryption key as input to the encryption algorithm. A message including data corresponding to the encryption key, a multicast address, a transport layer port number, an encryption algorithm selection, a message authentication code algorithm selection, a message authentication code key, an initialization vector or an access mode can be received, for example, at the client. A user can input his or her credentials (e.g., username and password) into a client which can be transmitted to authenticate the first user.","In yet another aspect, a method for establishing an encrypted multicast communication session over a communications network can include transmitting (e.g., via a client) a request for a first user to create or select a collaborative group based on specified criteria. The collaborative group can be dynamically created\/generated or selected based on the specified criteria. The method can include receiving (e.g., at the client) an encryption key for the collaborative group.","Specified criteria such as a geographical location of a user, an organization, a rank, or a set of users can be transmitted to request establishment of a collaborative group. A collaborative group can be selected\/dynamically generated\/created based on the specified criteria. Collaborative content, such as voice, video, or other data, can be transmitted between a first application on the client and a second application on a second client (e.g., via IP multicast). The content can be encrypted end-application to end-application above the network layer of the communications network using the received encryption key as input to an encryption algorithm. A user can input credentials which can be transmitted to, for example, a server, to authenticate the first user.","A message can include data corresponding to the encryption key, a multicast address, a transport layer port number, an encryption algorithm selection, a message authentication code algorithm selection, a message authentication code key, an initialization vector or an access mode. The message can be sent to a user (e.g., at a client).","In yet another aspect, a system for establishing an encrypted multicast communication session over a communications network can include a client means for transmitting a request for a first user to join a pre-defined collaborative group including at least the first user and a second user. The system can also include a server means for retrieving or generating an encryption key for the pre-defined collaborative group and transmitting the encryption key to the client means.","In still another aspect, a system for establishing an encrypted multicast communication session over a communications network can include a client means for transmitting a request for a first user to create or select a collaborative group based on specified criteria. The system can also include a server means for selecting or dynamically generating\/creating the collaborative group based on the specified criteria. The server means can also select or generate an encryption key for the collaborative group and transmit the encryption key to the client means.","Other aspects and advantages of the invention can become apparent from the following drawings and description, all of which illustrate the principles of the invention, by way of example only.","Users can join a pre-defined or a dynamically generated or selected collaborative group to transmit\/receive collaborative content with other users, which can be encrypted \u201cend to end\u201d above the network layer (e.g., at an application layer) of the communications network. All users of the collaborative group, including, for example, the initiator of a session, can receive selected or generated encryption keys, for example, from their home domain server. Communications can be enabled among users on a client (e.g., devices such as a radio, laptop, workstation, PDA, etc.) using Voice over Internet Protocol (VoIP) transmitted over IP multicast. Communication sessions include, for example, a \u201cstatic voice net\u201d multicast communication session where the members (e.g., users) within a collaborative group of users are pre-defined, or a dynamic collaborative group communication session where a dynamically created group of users can communicate in a secure multicast session. An authorized user can initiate the call to another user or group of users, meeting certain condition (e.g. geographic locality, rank, or organization). An authorized user can be defined as a user whose credentials (e.g., username and password) have been authenticated and who has been authorized to initiate communication sessions amongst users in a collaborative group. A server (e.g., a Session Initiation Protocol (SIP) server) can bring in the other user(s) on the caller's (e.g., initiator user) behalf, using a multicast address, port and master key determined and distributed by the server. The signaling plane protocol (e.g., SIP or other comparable protocol) and bearer plane cryptographic protocol (e.g., Secure Real-time Transport Protocol (SRTP) or comparable protocol) can reside at the application layer.",{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0034","num":"0033"},"figref":"FIG. 1","b":["100","100","110","110","100","120","130","110","110","180","180","110","110","150","150","110","110","110","110","140","140","120","120","110","110","140","140","120","110","110","160","170","170","120","150","110","110","120","110","110","120","120","160","110","110","120","130","100","110","110","180","180"]},"The encryption key  can include, for example, a crypto algorithm and algorithm mode selection, master key, salt key, key lifetime, key length, key index, etc. Communication parameters A or B can include, for example, a multicast address, a transport layer port number, an encryption algorithm selection, a message authentication code algorithm selection, a message authentication code key, an initialization vector or an access mode\/access permission. The access mode\/access permission can define a client user's access rights to a collaborative group (e.g., as a listener, contributor, whether the user is allowed to join the collaborative group (for example, where \u201cno access\u201d would indicate that the user is not allowed to access the session), etc.). A user can be a member of one or more collaborative groups.","Data relating to the client A or B users, collaborative groups and other communication parameters can be stored in a database, for example, on server  or .

For example, users can input credentials A or B (e.g., username and password) into the client A and B which can be sent to the server . Server  can authenticate the users by verifying the received credentials with stored credentials (e.g., Table 3 for example, stored either on server  or server ). In some embodiments, the stored credentials are on server  and server  authenticates the client A or B user by verifying the received credentials A or B with the credentials stored on server . In some embodiments, a client A or B user is authenticated each time the client A or B user requests to join a communications session with other users of a collaborative group.","A user can also be authorized via server . For example, when a user requests to join a pre-defined collaborative group or when a user requests establishment of a collaborative group, the server  can determine an access permission for the user. The access permissions determine whether a user is part of the collaborative group and, if so, the access mode, i.e., whether the user is a contributor or listener. The server  can authorize the user by looking in a database of access permissions for different collaborative groups (e.g., Table 2). The database can be stored, for example, on server  or server .

The request A or B can be a message sent from the client A or B to the server  including an identifier for the pre-defined collaborative group, such as, for example, a uniform resource identifier (URI) or a telephone number. The pre-defined collaborative group can include any number of users, for example, the first user of client A and the second user of client B. In some embodiments, collaborative groups are pre-defined based on specified criteria (e.g., such as geographical location, organization, or rank). For example, if a collaborative group is pre-defined based on rank, the request A or B to join the collaborative group can include sending a message to the server  with a URI specifying the rank of the users for the collaborative group. Server  can retrieve or generate an encryption key  for the pre-defined collaborative group. In some embodiments, the encryption keys are stored in server  and server  retrieves the encryption key from server . The encryption key  can be generated by, for example server , for example, using a random number generator. The server  can transmit the encryption key  for the pre-defined collaborative group to at least the client A or B user that initiated the request. In some embodiments, the server  can transmit the encryption key to other clients (e.g., other users in the collaborative group) where the client users are in the same domain.","A user can also send, via the client A or B, a request A or B to establish a collaborative group based on specified criteria. The criteria can specify a set of identified users (e.g., explicitly identifying John Doe, Jane Doe, etc.). The criteria can also be based on a geographical location, an organization or a rank of the users. Server  and\/or server  can have a database of information that has data corresponding to, for example, a geographical location, organization or rank for each user. The database can be compiled based on information received and stored from the users (e.g., via clients A or B) during, for example, registration of the client A or B with the server. A collaborative group can be dynamically generated by identifying users that meet the specified criteria. For example, if a user initiates a communication session with users located within 10 miles of a specified location, a collaborative group can be dynamically generated by identifying users in the database that have geographical location that meets this criteria. The server  can also search a database (e.g., database in Table 2 stored, for example, on server  or sever ) of collaborative groups that have users meeting the specified criteria. The server  can generate an encryption key (e.g., using a random number generator) or select an encryption key from a database of stored encryption keys (e.g., database of encryption keys stored on server  or on another server ) for the collaborative group. In some embodiments, the database of stored encryption keys (e.g., as shown in Table 1) is stored on server  and server  selects from the database to select an encryption key, for example, unassigned to be assigned to the collaborative group. The server  can then transmit the encryption key  to at least the client A or B user initiating the session and initiating the request to establish the collaborative group. In some embodiments, the server  transmits the encryption key  to any one of the other users in the collaborative group.","The client A or B can communicate with the server  by sending messages. The messages can, for example, include data corresponding to an encryption key  or other communication parameters A or B (e.g., a multicast address, a transport layer port number, an encryption algorithm selection, a message authentication code algorithm selection, a message authentication code key, an initialization vector or an access mode). In embodiments where the client A or B user requests A or B to create or select a collaborative group, the client A or B can send messages to the server  including data corresponding to the specified criteria (e.g., data for the geographic location, data for the specified rank, data for the specified organization, or data identifying specific users to be included in the collaborative group). In some embodiments, the server  can send a message to client A or B that includes data, for example, in an attribute field of the message.","Users of a collaborative group can communicate with one another via the clients A and B. The clients A and B can transmit and receive collaborative content A or B including, for example, voice or video. Collaborative content A or B can be encrypted and transmitted (e.g., via IP multicast) \u201cend to end\u201d at the application layer (e.g., between collaborative applications running on clients A and B on behalf of their users). The content A or B can be encrypted end-application to end-application (e.g., on clients A or B) above the network layer using the received encryption key as input to the encryption algorithm.","In some embodiments, the security of the multicast communications session can be compromised. The security of the collaborative group can be threatened, for example, due to a compromise of the third user or third user's client. In such a case, the communication session can be terminated and a new encryption key can be sent to the users of the group. For example, the collaborative group can include a first user, a second user and a third user. In the event that the security of the third user is compromised, the server can transmit a termination message to members\/users of the collaborative group. The server can transmit a second encryption key to the first user and the second user and delete the previous encryption key after a predetermined amount of time (e.g., so as to maintain continuous communication between the users).",{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0047","num":"0046"},"figref":["FIG. 2","FIG. 1"],"b":["190","110","110","120","120","200","200","110","120","200","110","120","200","110","110","120","120","190","110","110"]},"Each server A and B can perform the tasks of transmitting encryption keys, authenticating client users, registering client users, etc. for the client A and B users in their home domain A and B. The servers A and B in the different domains A and B can have a mutual trust relationship. For example, if the first server A receives credentials A from the first client A user and authenticates the first client A user's credentials against stored credentials in a database (e.g., stored in server A or other server such as server  in ), the second server B in the second domain B will not authenticate the first client A user from the first domain A.","Each server A and B in the home domain for the collaborative group can perform tasks of authorizing users for the collaborative group (e.g., determining the access permissions including determining if a user is authorized to request joining the group and the access mode (listener\/contributor), etc.) Therefore, if a collaborative group belongs in a first domain A and the collaborative group includes a first client A user in the first domain A and a second client B user in the second domain B, the second server B can send authenticated identity information to first server A so that the first server can perform the task of authorization (e.g., determining access permissions of the user).","A first client A user can request to join a pre-defined collaborative group in a first domain A. The first client A can send the join request A to the server for its domain, server A, which can also be the server for the collaborative group. Client A can also send the credentials A for its user to first server A (usually when challenged). First server A can authenticate the client A's user, and check the access permissions for the collaborative group to determine if the user of the client A is authorized to access the group. If so, server A can retrieve or generate the encryption key  for the pre-defined collaborative group and send the encryption key  to the first client A over an appropriately secured connection. A second client B can send a request B to join a collaborative group to its domain server B. Client B can also send the credentials B of its user (usually when challenged by server B). Since the collaborative group is in domain A, server B, after authenticating the identity of client B's user using credentials B, can send the join request C to server A, along with the authenticated identity of client B's user. The first server A can transmit the encryption key  to the second server B in the second domain B over an appropriately secured connection. The second server B can then transmit the encryption key  to the second client B user over an appropriately secured connection. Clients A and B can then send or receive encrypted multicast communications A and B.","A first client A user in the first domain A can also request to establish a collaborative group in the first domain. The first server A can dynamically generate the collaborative group based on criteria received from the first client A or the first server A can search a database of collaborative groups (e.g., as shown in Table 2) to select a collaborative group that meets the specified criteria.","The first server A in the first domain A can also distribute the encryption key  used to encrypt the multicast communication session by either selecting the encryption key  from a database of encryption keys (e.g., such as Table 1 above, stored either on the first server A or another server such as an LDAP server as described in ) or generating the encryption key  for the collaborative group and send the encryption key  to the first client A. The first server  can also transmit the encryption key  to the second server B in the second domain B. The second server B can then transmit the encryption key  to the second client B user in its home domain (e.g., the second domain B).","In some embodiments, the system  can include a third domain (not shown). A third server (e.g., server  as shown in  in the third domain) (not shown) can send, for example, an encryption key for the pre-defined collaborative group to the first client A of the first user via the first server A, where the first user and the first server A belong to the first domain A and the collaborative group and the third server belong to the third domain. The third server can also transmit a multicast address, a transport layer port number, an encryption algorithm selection, a message authentication code algorithm selection, a message authentication code key, an initialization vector or an access mode to the first client A of the first user via the first server A. If a security of the collaborative group is threatened, the server of the home domain for the collaborative group can send a new encryption key and\/or a termination message to the users of the collaborative group via the server in the home domain for the user. By way of example, where the collaborative group belongs to the third domain, the third server can send a termination message to the first client A of the first user via the first server A belonging to the first domain A.",{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0054","num":"0053"},"figref":["FIG. 3","FIG. 1","FIG. 1","FIG. 1","FIG. 1","FIG. 2"],"b":["110","210","120","130","220","230","240","120","120","120","240","250","260","270"]},{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0055","num":"0054"},"figref":["FIG. 4","FIG. 1","FIG. 1","FIG. 1","FIG. 1"],"b":["110","110","280","110","110","120","120","130","290","300","310","320","330","330","340","350","110","110","2","360"]},"A request to establish a collaborative group (Step ) can include criteria from a client user. The criteria can include, for example, specifying a set of identified users (e.g., explicitly identifying John Doe, Jane Doe, etc.), a geographical location, an organization or a rank of the users. A database (e.g., located on server  or  in ) can store information relating to a user identifier, a geographical location, an organization or a rank for each individual users. A server (e.g., server  in  or servers A and B in ) can use the database to determine which users satisfy the specified criteria and generate the dynamic collaborative group accordingly. The server can also search a stored database (e.g., Table 1 stored, for example, on server  or server  of ) of collaborative groups for groups that include users that meet the specified criteria.","A server (e.g., server  as shown in  and server A or B in ) can select encryption keys from a database of stored encryption keys (e.g., stored in server  or server  as shown in ). The server can select an unused\/unassigned encryption key from the database and assign an encryption key for the collaborative group (Step A). The server can also generate an encryption key, for example, using a random number generator (Step B).","The above-described techniques can be implemented in digital electronic circuitry, or in computer hardware, firmware, software, or in combinations of them. The implementation can be as a computer program product, i.e., a computer program tangibly embodied in an information carrier (e.g., in a machine-readable storage device or computer-readable storage medium\/device\/apparatus) for execution by, or to control the operation of, data processing apparatus, e.g., a programmable processor, a computer, or multiple computers. A computer program can be written in any form of programming language, including compiled or interpreted languages, and it can be deployed in any form, including as a stand-alone program or as a module, component, subroutine, or other unit suitable for use in a computing environment. A computer program can be deployed to be executed on one computer or on multiple computers at one site or distributed across multiple sites and interconnected by a communication network.","Method steps can be performed by one or more programmable processors executing a computer program to perform functions of the invention by operating on input data and generating output. Method steps can also be performed by, and apparatus can be implemented as, special purpose logic circuitry, e.g., an FPGA (field programmable gate array) or an ASIC (application specific integrated circuit). Modules can refer to portions of the computer program and\/or the processor\/special circuitry that implements that functionality.","Processors suitable for the execution of a computer program include, by way of example, both general and special purpose microprocessors, and any one or more processors of any kind of digital computer. Generally, a processor will receive instructions and data from a read-only memory or a random access memory or both. The essential elements of a computer are a processor for executing instructions and one or more memory devices for storing instructions and data. Generally, a computer will also include, or be operatively coupled to receive data from or transfer data to, or both, one or more mass storage devices for storing data, e.g., magnetic, magneto-optical disks, or optical disks. Data transmission and instructions can also occur over a communications network. Information carriers suitable for embodying computer program instructions and data include all forms of non-volatile memory, including by way of example semiconductor memory devices, e.g., EPROM, EEPROM, and flash memory devices; magnetic disks, e.g., internal hard disks or removable disks; magneto-optical disks; and CD-ROM and DVD-ROM disks. The processor and the memory can be supplemented by, or incorporated in special purpose logic circuitry.","To provide for interaction with a user, the above described techniques can be implemented on a computer having a display device, e.g., a CRT (cathode ray tube) or LCD (liquid crystal display) monitor, for displaying information to the user and a keyboard and a pointing device, e.g., a mouse or a trackball, by which the user can provide input to the computer (e.g., interact with a user interface element). Other kinds of devices can be used to provide for interaction with a user as well; for example, feedback provided to the user can be any form of sensory feedback, e.g., visual feedback, auditory feedback, or tactile feedback; and input from the user can be received in any form, including acoustic, speech, or tactile input.","The above described techniques can be implemented in a distributed computing system that includes a back-end component, e.g., as a data server, and\/or a middleware component, e.g., an application server, and\/or a front-end component, e.g., a client computer having a graphical user interface and\/or a Web browser through which a user can interact with an example implementation, or any combination of such back-end, middleware, or front-end components. The components of the system can be interconnected by any form or medium of digital data communication, e.g., a communication network. Examples of communication networks include a local area network (\u201cLAN\u201d) and a wide area network (\u201cWAN\u201d), e.g., the Internet, and include both wired and wireless networks.","The computing system can include clients and servers. A client and server are generally remote from each other and typically interact through a communication network. The relationship of client and server arises by virtue of computer programs running on the respective computers and having a client-server relationship to each other.","The invention has been described in terms of particular embodiments.
