title: Semantic service applying system and method
abstract: The present invention relates to a semantic service applying system and a method, comprising: a semantic service pipeline manager which demands and receives a particular semantic service pipeline to and from a semantic service server, and stores the corresponding pipeline in a database to manage the stored pipeline; a semantic service pipeline provider which extracts corresponding semantic service pipelines and sends the extracted pipelines to the corresponding service server if the user requests at least one of a plurality of semantic service pipelines to be provided; and a database which stores information associated with a semantic service pipeline providing server as well as the semantic service pipelines, and thus various ontology-based semantic services can be applied to the web.

A search Application Programming Interface (API) or an API executing a specific command widely adopts the web service method.","With the development of the Internet, APIs adopting web service are increased, and services using the API are further increased.","Accordingly, the creation of new services through web service combinations is emerging as an important issue. This is because services created through the web service combinations have great costs versus effects as compared with services newly constructed.","A task of finding a proper combination based on web services where a web service combination is described in a syntactic way becomes static, or the task has limitation to dependency on a manual task.","In order to overcome this, there has recently been made an attempt to access a web service description, such as OWL-S, in a semantic way using OWL through standardization organizations, such as W3C.","There is, however, also a limit to the attempt. This is because the subject of the description itself is not semantic service, but common web service.","In other words, there is not proposed a method of intelligently attempting a web service combination because semantic service providing a search API or a reasoning API based on ontology is not taken into consideration.","Consequently, there is an urgent need for technical support for creating new semantic service through a combination of ontology-based semantic services that are expected to abruptly increase in the future, but there is no method of supporting the urgent need using the prior art.","The present invention has been made in view of the above problems occurring in the prior art, and an object of the present invention is to provide a semantic service application system and method for generating semantic service pipelines in which ontology-based semantic services distributed among service servers are combined, for selecting, collecting, and managing a specific semantic service pipeline from among the generated semantic service pipelines, and for applying the specific semantic service pipeline to a web frame or a web page.","Another object of the present invention is to change a factor of a semantic service pipeline so that the semantic service pipeline is suitable for the subject to which the semantic service pipeline will be applied.","To achieve the above objects, a semantic service application system of the present invention comprises a semantic service server for collecting pieces of ontology-based semantic service information and ontology from a plurality of service servers, registering the pieces of ontology-based semantic service information and ontology, generating semantic service pipelines based on a plurality of semantic services according to a condition inputted by a user, and executing a specific semantic service pipeline;","a semantic service pipeline providing server for requesting the semantic service server to execute the specific semantic service pipeline, receiving a result of the execution, determining whether to select the specific semantic service pipeline, receiving the specific semantic service pipeline by requesting the specific semantic service pipeline from the semantic service server if the specific semantic service pipeline is determined to be selected, and storing the specific semantic service pipeline;

Furthermore, a search API includes the ontology information in the input factor, but does not utilize the output factor or the ontology information.","Meanwhile, not the ontology, but a common API may also be used as the input factor and the output factor according to the necessity of an operator.","For example, ontology-based semantic services use semantic information in the input factor and output results. In case of semantic service that finds experts for specific research subjects, a Uniform Resource Identifier (URI) that is an ontology standard identification system is used as the input factor, and identifiers are provided as the output results using the URI.","Here, ontology is a specification that is explicitly standardized in order to provide a concept for any interest field, and the ontology includes an ontology schema and ontology instances.","The ontology instance means a real value or an entity that is matched with ontology classes, and the ontology classes mean a concept from among elements forming the ontology schema.","Furthermore, the instance means a real value or an entity that is matched with a class.","First,  is a diagram showing the construction of a semantic service application system according to the present invention.","As shown, the semantic service application system includes a semantic service server , service servers , and a semantic service pipeline providing server .","More particularly, the semantic service server  collects pieces of ontology-based semantic service information and ontology from the plurality of service servers, registers the pieces of ontology-based semantic service information and ontology, generates semantic service pipelines based on a plurality of semantic services according to a condition inputted by a user, and executes a specific semantic service pipeline.","Here, the plurality of service servers means the subjects from which the semantic services will be collected and generally means all servers, such as a server that provides a various portal services, a server that provides specific education data, and a server that provides search service.","Furthermore, the plurality of service servers may be identical with or different from reference numeral .","The semantic service pipeline providing server  requests the semantic service server  to execute a specific semantic service pipeline, receives a result of the execution, and determines whether to select the specific semantic service pipeline based on a result of the execution.
